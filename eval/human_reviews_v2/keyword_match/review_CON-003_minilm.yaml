    1.16.1 Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System Simulation

    Because of advances in computer technology and terrain mapping capabilities,

    GPWS manufacturers have developed improved terrain avoidance systems. In 1997, the

    FAA certified a new terrain awareness and warning system (TAWS), also known as

    enhanced GPWS. (See section 1.18.2.2 for general information about enhanced GPWS.)

    This system was not installed or required on the accident airplane.75
