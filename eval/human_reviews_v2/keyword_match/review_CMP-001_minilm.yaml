    Aircraft Accident Report

    Maintenance procedures are developed and are expected to be followed to ensure

    that maintenance work is properly performed. When a maintenance procedure contains

    multiple steps that are not applicable to the airplane on which a mechanic is working,141 a

    mechanic may decide to skip applicable steps. Although well-trained mechanics may be

    more capable of distinguishing between steps that are and are not applicable to a particular

    aircraft than mecha...'
