    1.16.1 Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System Simulation

    Because of advances in computer technology and terrain mapping capabilities,

    GPWS manufacturers have developed improved terrain avoidance systems. In 1997, the

    FAA certified a new terrain awareness and warning system (TAWS), also known as

    enhanced GPWS. (See section 1.18.2.2 for general information about enhanced GPWS.)
