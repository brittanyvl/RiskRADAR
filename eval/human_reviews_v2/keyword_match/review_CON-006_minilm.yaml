    conclusion was based on the “frequency of occurrence of titanium metallurgical defects, the

    difficulty of detecting defects in titanium,…the many sources of defects, errors and damage,

    recent developments in the engineering science of fracture mechanics (crack propagation)

    analysis” and developments in reliability ...'
