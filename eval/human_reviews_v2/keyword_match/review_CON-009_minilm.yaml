    generating aircraft, and wind will hasten breakup. When the vortices sink close to

    the ground (about 200 feet), they tend to move laterally outward about 5 knots ina

    vortice and will decrease the lateral movement of the upwind vortice. Calcule ions indicate that the wingtip vortices

    the moderate nature of the initially
