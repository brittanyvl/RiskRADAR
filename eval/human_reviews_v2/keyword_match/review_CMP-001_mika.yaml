    Aircraft Accident Report

    Maintenance procedures are developed and are expected to be followed to ensure

    that maintenance work is properly performed. When a maintenance procedure contains

    multiple steps that are not applicable to the airplane on which a mechanic is working,141 a

    mechanic may decide to skip applicable steps. Although well-trained mechanics may be

    more capable of distinguishing between steps that are and are not applicable to a particular

    aircraft than mecha...'

    proper recordkeeping, which in turn disrupted the correction of deficiencies and

    ultimately the airworthiness of the aircraft. During the Safety Boards investigation, there was evidence, however, that
    the revised AAIP and the reeommendations which resulted from the January 1979 surveillance by the FAA were

    improving the maintenance effort.
