    Airbus vice president indicated that the manufacturers were concerned about the AAMP’s

    emphasis on rudder and utilization of simulation. Airbus did not initially favor the use of

    simulators for upset recovery training because the forces that a pilot would experience in

    terms of increased weight or G loading, both vertically and laterally, could not be

    duplicated in a simulator. Also, Airbus was concerned about simulator fidelity and the
