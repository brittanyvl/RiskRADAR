    B-737 (0.036 inch) was slightly less than that of the B-727 (0.040 inch).

    However, fatigue testing of a complete B-737 was not accomplished as it was

    on the B-727. That is, the complete B-727 fuselage was cycled for

    60,000 cycles (one economic design life goal) during certification whereas

    the B-737 fuselage design concept was demonstrated by fatigue testing a

    representative crown-to-keel half section of the fuselage. The test section

    of this separation, an explosive decompression occurred, and a large portion

    of the airplane cabin structure comprising the upper portion of section 43

    was lost. The Safety Board’s analysis of this accident included an evaluation
