    Aircraft Accident Report

    In a January 16, 1997, letter to the Safety Board, the FAA stated that it was

    considering an NPRM proposing to require that air carriers conduct training that will

    emphasize recognition, prevention, and recovery from aircraft attitudes that are normally

    not associated with air carrier flight operations. In its July 15, 1997, response, the Safety

    Board stated that it was not aware of any training programs that specifically add...'
