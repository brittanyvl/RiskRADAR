    this test should not be considered conclusive, and that standard test methods should be

    relied upon. In addition, the airplane was fueled at Anchorage, as well as at previous

    refueling stations in the Reeve system, with Jet A fuel. Therefore, it would have been

    impossible to have JP-4 fuel in the fuel controls, Therefore, the Safety Board concludes

    that the fuel was Jet A. The Safety Board further concludes that the water in...'
