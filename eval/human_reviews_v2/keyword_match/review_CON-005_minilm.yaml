    was consistent with the degrading effects (slowed reactions and/or tunnel vision) of

    fatigue. The Safety Board concludes that, on the basis of the less than optimal overnight

    was found that the time since awakening for each pilot related to significant

    differences in performance, in terms of the number and types of errors made by

    pilots. As a result of this safety study, on February 3, 1994, the Safety Board
