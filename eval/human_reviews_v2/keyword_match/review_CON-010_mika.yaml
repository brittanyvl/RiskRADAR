    January/February 1992, issue of Human Factors and Aviation Medicine:


    Maintaining spatial orientation during flight when the outside horizon

    visual reference is lost requires either orientation instrument displays

    or automatic stabilization systems. Pilot exposure to linear and

    angular accelerative forces during loss-of-outside-reference flight

    produces confusing vestibular and proprioceptor stimul...'

    misleading because the body no longer has a fixed reference with which to orient

    against, as the individual moves when the aircraft moves. Further, steady aircraft

    motion, or an accelerating or decelerating aircraft, can produce vestibular

    sensations that are at odds with the reality of the body’s orientation. Generally,

    have been using the autopilot during the approach. The operational procedure for executing a missed approach would have
    been:

    add power (probably climb power), raise the nose, establish and verify a positive rate of

    climb, and raise the landing gear and flaps. In this case, the pilot also would have turned
