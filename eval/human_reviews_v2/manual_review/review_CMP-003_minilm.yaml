    1. General


    The Federal Aviation Administration’s (FAA) Service Difficulty Report

    (SDR) data base was queried for information pertaining to the Boeing 737

    fuselage. It was found that 3,387 records existed from the beginning of the

    current data base (January, 1983) to February 7, 1989. This number was reduced

    to 2,082 records by eliminating all models of the 737 that were not produced

    as part of the first 291 airplanes. Between January, 198...'
