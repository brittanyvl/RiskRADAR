    BOARD MEMBER STATEMENTS


    Member Hersman, Concurring:


    It was clear in the Safety Board’s deliberation of probable cause of this accident that

    some of the board members believed it crucial to maintain a sharp focus on the pilots’

    behavior as the cause of this accident, and that to cite too many other factors in this tragic

    event would undermine that focus. While I share a desire to emphasize pilot behavior as

    the chief component of causation in this acc...'
