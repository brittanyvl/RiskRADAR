    interviews with pilots, although they frequently observed residual ice on the

    boots, the only reported ice bridging incident happened to a light twin piston

    engined aircraft. Piston engined aircraft have a pneumatic system which

    operates from an engine driven pump, rather than engine bleed air. This

    means that compared to a turboprop aircraft, the system pressures are lower

    and the boot inflation times are longer. These differences may be crucial and
