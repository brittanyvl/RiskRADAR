    or not ice bridging is a real

    possibility for turboprop aircraft. If it is not, the need for accurate

    measurement of ice thickness disappears, and the issue becomes one of

    detecting airframe ice. Ice bridging may still be a problem for turboprop aircraft when the pressure in

    the de-icing boots [is] low. This may be due to a puncture/lea...'
