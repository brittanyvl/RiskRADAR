    wants to program the flight director in advance of the subsequent phase of flight. However, only one pilot station can
    be coupled at a time, and a lack of pilot awareness

    regarding which set of command cues is coupled to the autopilot can lead to automation

    Two indications in the cockpit provide the pilot with direct feedback regarding the

    flight director status: the FD1/2 button on the autopilot controller on the center pedestal

    they are overconfident in automation and may fail to exercise appropriate vigilance.107 As

    a result, significant deviations in altitude or flightpath, if controlled by automation, may

    develop without detection by the flight crew, especially when the flight crew is focused on
