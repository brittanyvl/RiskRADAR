    Probable Cause

    The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of

    the accident was the pilots’ failure to follow established procedures and properly conduct

    a nonprecision instrument approach at night in instrument meteorological conditions,

    including their descent below the minimum descent altitude (MDA) before required visual

    cues were available (which continued unmoderated until the airplane struck the trees) and

    their failure to adhere to the established divis...'

    The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of
