    Aircraft Accident Report

    Maintenance procedures are developed and are expected to be followed to ensure

    that maintenance work is properly performed. When a maintenance procedure contains

    multiple steps that are not applicable to the airplane on which a mechanic is working,141 a

    mechanic may decide to skip applicable steps. Although well-trained mechanics may be

    more capable of distinguishing between steps that are and are not applicable to a particular

    aircraft than mechanics with l...'

    Aircraft Accident Report

    2.7.3 Summary

    On the basis of the information in sections 2.7.2.1 and 2.7.2.2, the Safety Board

    concludes that at the time of the flight 261 accident, Alaska Airlines’ maintenance

    program had widespread systemic deficiencies. As previously discussed, two specific

    maintenance-related deficiencies—insufficient lubrication of the accident jackscrew

    assembly and extension of the end play check interval—were causal to the accident. The

    Board could not establish w...'
