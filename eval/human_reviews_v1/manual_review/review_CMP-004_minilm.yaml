    Probable Cause

    The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of

    the accident was the captain’s and first officer’s failure to establish and maintain a proper

    glidepath during the night visual approach to landing. Contributing to the accident was a

    combination of the captain’s and first officer’s fatigue, the captain’s and first officer’s

    failure to adhere to company flight procedures, the captain’s and flight engineer’s failure

    The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of

    cues were available (which continued unmoderated until the airplane struck the trees) and
