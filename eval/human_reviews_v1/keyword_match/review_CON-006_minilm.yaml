    <.l Analysis


    Examination of the wreckage early in the investigation

    revealed that a fatigue fracture in the shank of the yellow

    blade spindle resulted in separation of the yellow main rotor

    blade, and caused loss of control of the aircraft. It was

    subsequently determined that no other factors related to the

    operation of the flight were involved. Consequently, the

    main thrust of the investigation focused on the circumstances

    Metallurgical Examination

    The fractured components of the accident fan hub were examined in the Safety

    Board’s materials laboratory. The fan hub had fractured radially in two places (see figure 9a). One of the radial fractures
    contained a fatigue crack that originated at two locations on the

    inboard side of a tierod hole (see figure 9b). The two origins were located within the tierod hole

    at distances of 0.307 inch and 0.553 inch from the aft edge of the hole. Fati...'
