    Aircraft Accident Report

    traditional ground proximity warning system (GPWS).87 A traditional GPWS uses the

    radar altimeter to calculate closure rate with terrain to predict a potential collision threat. Although a traditional
    GPWS can help prevent CFIT, a traditional GPWS cannot provide

    a timely warning to the flight crew if the terrain rises steeply. As a result, on October 16,

    1996, the Safety Board issued Safety Recommendation A-96-101,88 which asked the FAA

    to do the f...'

    1.16.1 Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System Simulation

    Because of advances in computer technology and terrain mapping capabilities,

    GPWS manufacturers have developed improved terrain avoidance systems. In 1997, the

    FAA certified a new terrain awareness and warning system (TAWS), also known as

    enhanced GPWS. (See section 1.18.2.2 for general information about enhanced GPWS.)

    This system was not installed or required on the accident airplane.75
