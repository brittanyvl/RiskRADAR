    Reduced visibility conditions, such as IMC or dark night VMC, also greatly

    increase the risk of spatial disorientation. One recent study of U.S. Army rotary-wing

    operations found that sudden loss of visual cues preceded about 25 percent of helicopter

    accidents attributed to spatial disorientation.60

    Spatial Disorientation

    One purpose for instrument training and maintaining instrument proficiency is to

    prevent a pilot from being misled by several types of hazardous illusions that are peculiar

    to flight. Under IFR conditions, an aircraft’s attitude can only be determined accurately by

    observing and interpreting the flight instruments and rejecting the bodily sensations

    associated with the aircraft’s movement, which can be exacerbated by head movements. Practice and expe...'
