    Aircraft Accident Report

    In a January 16, 1997, letter to the Safety Board, the FAA stated that it was

    considering an NPRM proposing to require that air carriers conduct training that will

    emphasize recognition, prevention, and recovery from aircraft attitudes that are normally

    not associated with air carrier flight operations. In its July 15, 1997, response, the Safety

    Board stated that it was not aware of any training programs that specifically addressed

    unusual attitud...'

    In public hearing testimony, the vice president of training for Airbus North

    America customer services indicated that the manufacturers wanted upset training to be

    developed as awareness training because of the infinite number of variables that could be

    experienced. The Airbus vice president also stated that many of the carriers wanted to

    develop upset training procedures that could be adapted to all of their fleets. The joint industry Airplane Ups...'

    In a January 26, 1993, letter to the FAA, the Safety Board stated that it continued

    to believe that instrument-rated pilots should receive recurrent training in techniques for

    recognizing and recovering from unusual attitudes and that proficiency programs should

    include this same training. The letter also stated the Board’s belief that requiring such

    training annually would greatly enhance a pilot’s ability to safely recover from an unusual

    members of the training community believe that advanced simulators should not be used

    in upset training because the range of simulator fidelity is relatively narrow and the

    portrayal of accelerations is not comparable with what could occur during an aggressive

    upset.210 Therefore, the Safety Board concludes that the use of lower levels of automation,

    such as simulators without motion or simple computer screen displays, may be more

    appropriate to provide the ...'

    recognized the need for such training by voluntarily developing programs, such as the

    is widespread agreement among operations and training managers that unusual attitude

    training helps prepare flight crews for such unusual situations. However, without a
