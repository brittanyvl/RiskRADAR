    A number of flight tests, simulator studies, and resultant publications

    have addressed the significant effects on aerodynamic performance that may result

    from icing on an airplane''s wing upper surface or leading edges during takeoff. Wind tunnel and flight tests have shown
    that minute amounts of ice or other

    conducted in the 1940s and 1950s indicate that an airfoil’s performance can be significantly

    affected by even a relatively small amount of ice accumulated on the leading edge area, if that
