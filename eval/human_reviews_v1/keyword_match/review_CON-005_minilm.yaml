    Over the past 40 years, there has been tremendous progress in our scientific understanding of

    sleep and circadian rhythms. Over the past 12 years, this information has been specifically applied

    to the operational requirements of the aviation industry. The human need for sleep and the effects

    of sleep loss and ciscadian disruption on waking performance are of particular importance in the

    current aviation accident investigation. The subjective sleep/wake data provided by flight crewme...'
