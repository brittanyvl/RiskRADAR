    In May 1999, the Safety Board adopted a safety report that evaluated the

    U.S. Department of Transportation’s (DOT) efforts in the 1990s to address operator

    fatigue.162 In its report, the Board noted that in 1989 it issued three recommendations to

    the DOT addressing needed research, education, and revisions to hours-of-service

    regulations.163 The Board stated that, even though the DOT and modal administrations had
