    Aircraft Accident Report

    In public hearing testimony, the vice president of training for Airbus North

    America customer services indicated that the manufacturers wanted upset training to be

    developed as awareness training because of the infinite number of variables that could be

    experienced. The Airbus vice president also stated that many of the carriers wanted to

    develop upset training procedures that could be adapted to all of their fleets. The joint industry Airplane Ups...'

    Aircraft Accident Report

    members of the training community believe that advanced simulators should not be used

    in upset training because the range of simulator fidelity is relatively narrow and the

    portrayal of accelerations is not comparable with what could occur during an aggressive

    upset.210 Therefore, the Safety Board concludes that the use of lower levels of automation,

    such as simulators without motion or simple computer screen displays, may be more

    appropriate to provide the ...'

    high altitude aerodynamics.68 Also, pilots received a copy of the Pinnacle Airlines Jet

    Upset Student Guide. A Pinnacle Airlines simulator instructor stated that pilots received about

    20 minutes of upset training in the simulator. The training consisted of Mach tuck and

    Mach buffet demonstrations69 and unusual attitude recoveries. Also, the simulator
