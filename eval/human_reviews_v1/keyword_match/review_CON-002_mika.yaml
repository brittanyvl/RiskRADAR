    1.16.1 Effects of Airframe Contamination on Airplane Performance


    A number of flight tests, simulator studies, and resultant publications

    have addressed the significant effects on aerodynamic performance that may result

    from icing on an airplane''s wing upper surface or leading edges during takeoff. Wind tunnel and flight tests have shown
    that minute amounts of ice or other

    contamination on the leading edges or upper surfaces can cause a significant

    reduction in the stall...'
