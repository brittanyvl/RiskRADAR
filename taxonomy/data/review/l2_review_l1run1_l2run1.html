pilot’s relatively short time flying in the local area suggests that his cognitive map of the terrain 
between Rudyerd Bay and Ketchikan may not have been as detailed or accurate compared to those 
of other pilots who had more local flying experience. Considering all these factors, it is possible 
that the accident pilot mistook the first mountain for the second one and turned the airplane west 
too early; such a mistake, in which a pilot does not recognize or maintain the desired position 
relative to the external ground and airspace environment is an example of geographic 
disorientation (Antuñano, Mohler, and Gosbee 1989). The fact that the pilot subsequently 
continued the flight straight and level at an altitude that would have been sufficient to clear terrain 
on the typical route (but was insufficient to clear the high terrain he was flying toward) further 
supports the possibility that the pilot was geographically disoriented. Thus, the NTSB concludes 
that the pilot’s continued flight in low-visibility conditions at a lower-than-normal vantage point 
in an area in which he lacked extensive flying experience reduced his ability to visually identify 
landmarks and resulted in a navigational error due to geographic disorientation. 
2.2.3 CFIT 
According to recorded flight data, the airplane’s final turn to the west occurred about 
half-standard rate; then the airplane continued on a nearly straight and level flightpath toward the 
higher terrain for about 30 seconds. In the final 2 seconds of the flight, the airplane pitched up 
rapidly, experiencing a vertical acceleration of about +2 Gs before colliding with terrain. The 
timing of the pilot’s aggressive pitch-up maneuver strongly supports the scenario that the pilot 
continued the flight into near-zero visibility conditions and, as soon as he realized that the flight 
was on a collision course with the terrain, he pulled aggressively on the elevator flight controls in 
an ineffective attempt to avoid the collision. Effective CFIT avoidance requires assessment of weather conditions and appropriate 
aeronautical decision-making in response to cues associated with deteriorating weather. The pilot 
missed opportunities to prevent the accident both in his decision to take the short route despite the 
presence of low clouds and obscured terrain, to turn toward an area of the lake where visibility 
was further reduced, and to continue the flight into deteriorating conditions rather than escape 
them.</div>

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] In reduced visibility weather conditions, Promech pilots 
typically fly southwest over Ella Lake and proceed beyond the south end of the lake before turning 
west. This route allows the flights to avoid the high terrain located west of the lake, which includes 
two similarly shaped mountains. (See figure 16.) 
 
Figure 16. The typical flight route (white) passes two similarly shaped mountains before turning 
west. For comparison, the path flown by the accident pilot is shown in green. Although the accident pilot climbed the airplane to an altitude that would have provided 
safe terrain clearance along the typical route, he deviated from that route and turned the airplane 
west after it passed only the first of the two mountains. The pilot’s route deviation placed the 
airplane on a collision course with the 1,900-ft second mountain, which it struck at an elevation of 
about 1,600 ft msl. (See figure 17.)

Figure 17. The path flown by the accident pilot (green), viewed from the approximate altitude of 
the accident airplane, is shown turning to the west (right) after passing the first mountain. Note: A translucent mask is imposed on the image to provide a notional representation of reduced visibility weather 
conditions. The vantage point of the image distorts the flight route depiction in the foreground (where the segment of 
the route originates in the bottom center of the image); there is no steep vertical climb in the flight route at the location 
shown in the foreground. Research suggests that, when navigating, people find their way through large-scale 
environments by learning to identify key landmarks (route knowledge) and developing map-like 
internal representations (cognitive maps) of the area. When traveling, people use the landmarks to 
update their position on their internal cognitive map and decide when and where to turn 
(Golledge 2010). However, a number of factors can increase the likelihood of navigational errors. Navigational errors are more likely if landmarks are difficult to discern or if cognitive maps are 
inaccurate (Golledge 2010). Landmarks are more difficult to discern when visibility of fine detail 
is degraded or when landmarks are viewed from an unfamiliar vantage point (Cuqlock-Knopp and 
Whitaker 1993; Schreiber et al. 1998). 
Several factors were present during the accident flight that increased the likelihood that the 
pilot would make a navigational error.35 Visibility was degraded over the south end of Ella Lake; 
thus, the pilot may not have been able to clearly distinguish some of the landmarks by which he 
typically navigated. In addition, the accident pilot was flying the route at a relatively low altitude 
because of the poor weather conditions, which resulted in his viewing terrain from a 
lower-than-normal vantage point. (The accident pilot had transited the area earlier that day about 
2,000 ft msl, and other Promech pilots had flown about 2,500 to 3,000 ft msl.) Further, the accident 
 
35 In addition, some pilots reported that it could be difficult to see directly ahead in the DHC-3 because the turbine 
engine conversion resulted in less efficient clearance of rain from the windscreen. However, investigators were unable 
to independently evaluate these claims.</div>

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] However, the DO (who provided the CFIT-avoidance training) and a Promech pilot 
who completed the training with the accident pilot differed in their assessments of the accident 
pilot’s performance. Although the DO believed that the accident pilot performed well during 
training, the other Promech pilot said that the accident pilot experienced difficulty performing the 
CFIT-avoidance maneuver. Based on this conflicting information, the investigation cannot draw a 
conclusion about the pilot’s level of proficiency and confidence in performing the CFIT-avoidance 
maneuver. During tour flights, the accident pilot’s responses to actual encounters with adverse weather 
varied under different circumstances. Although the DO and other Promech pilots described the 
accident pilot as a conservative decision-maker who was willing to turn back when weather 
conditions were poor, the accident pilot’s flights on the day of the accident demonstrated examples 
of both conservative and risk-taking decisions. The accident flight occurred during the third round of Promech tours that day. ADS-B data 
and passenger interviews showed that, when the accident pilot was returning from his first tour on 
the day of the accident, he responded to an IMC encounter by executing a climbing, 180° turn and 
then following a different route. During the accident pilot’s second tour of the day, however, he 
continued his flight into deteriorating conditions, and his airplane descended as low as 375 ft agl 
(which was below the FAA minimum altitude for that area). In addition, during the accident flight 
(the pilot’s third tour of the day), he chose to fly the short route despite the presence of low clouds 
and obscured terrain and then continued the flight into deteriorating weather rather than escape it. One major difference between the scenarios is that, during the tour in which he reversed 
course, the accident pilot was flying alone, whereas, during the two tours in which he continued 
flight into deteriorating weather (his second tour and the accident tour), he was following 5 to 
10 minutes behind other tour airplanes. This suggests that operational factors may have influenced 
the pilot’s decision-making. (Operational factors are discussed in section 2.3.) 
2.2.3.2 Nuisance Alerts from Class B TAWS during Tour Flights 
The accident airplane’s Chelton FlightLogic EFIS provided the Class B TAWS capabilities 
required by 14 CFR 135.154(b)(2) for the airplane (based on its engine and seating configuration). 
Class B TAWS alerting parameters, which are specified in FAA TSO-C151c, are based on terrain 
clearance of 700 ft agl in cruise flight and 500 ft agl during descent. When these clearances are not

Safety Board concludes that the flighterew did not perform a basic instrument flight
procedure, that of an adequate instrument sean, to ensure that all flight performance
parameters were within allowable tolerances. The evidence suggests that because the flighterew&#x27;s instrument sean was
improper, they were prone to continue an inadvertent descent below decision height. Because the crew had viewed aspects of the runway lights before executing a missed
approach, they probably believed, and the captain&#x27;s statements suggest that he assumed,
that a second attempt at landing would prove successful. Thus, it is possible that both
crewmembers, when approaching decision height, were preoccupied while attempting to
see the runway lights and approach lights and thus failed to maintain a proper scan of the
airplane instruments. Since the captain saw the runway lights on the first approach, he
may have believed that if he Increased his efforts to look for the lights, he could position
the airplane to land successfully on the second attempt. If the first officer had been
looking outside the covkpit in an effort to locate the runway, then he could not have made
the required altitude callouts. Although the evidence allowed the Board to rule out several possible causes of
the accident and to suggest several reasons for the flighterew&#x27;s actions, the fact remeins
that the Board was unable, due to the absence of an FDR or a CVR, to determine why the

flighterew did not execute a missed approach as required and instead continued the
descent past the decision height. Consequently, the Board can only state that flight 1746
continued its descent beyond decision height and into the terrain for undetermined
reasons,

2.4 FAA Surveillance

The Safety Board examined closely the nature of the FAA surveillance of
Simmons to determine its effect on the airline&#x27;s operations, and its possible effect on the
accident. The principal operations inspector (POI) was located in Chicago and the
principal maintenance (PMI) and avionics (PAI) inspectors in Grand Rapids. A large part
of Simmonst maintenance wes performed in Grand Rapids, the alrline corporate
headquarters were in Chicago, and its operations were based in Marquette. The Safety Board believes that the FAA surveillance of Simmons was
consistent during the period of Simmons! rani? expansion. The POI nad been associatea
with Simmons since 1983 and had been PO: since May 1985. She had witnessed the large
growth of the company in that time and had observed the changes in quality of the
operation that may have occurred. The Board believes, based on the record of
surveillance and her statements, that the POI was aware of the changes in the Simmons
operations during that time and attempted to monitor closely the possible adverse
consequences of growth and pilot turnover on those operations.</div>

This suggests that he assumed, incorrectly, that the absence of information on a change in
the weather indicated no change in weather. The Board further Lelieves that the captain&#x27;s

~35-

failure to ask for or obtain more weather information from ATC or the Simmons station
manager, led the captain to decide to attempt a second approach into Alpsna when the
airport was below minimums for that approach. The Safrty Board believes that, regardless of the extent to which pilots had
been given unsolicited updates to Alpena&#x27;s weather, &amp; prudent eaptain would not have
assumed that the weather had not changed in an approximate 30-minute period, since the
first report was received, or the approximate 60-minute period since the weather
obse: vation had been performed, particularly since the report available indicated that
visibility was at minimum conditions. If the first officer had not obtained a weather
update on his own initiative, then the captain should have asked him to do so. The request
would not have been difficult to make since Simmons required its pilots to wear headsets
and use associated interphones that facilitated communications between crewmembers. Further, the captain stated that there was no difficulty in communication within the
cockpit. The Safety Board concludes that the Simmons procedures for flying precision
instrument approach procedures, although in compliance with applicable FAA regulations,
should have been more specific with regard to defining stabized and unstabilized
approaches and providing guidance on when to execute 4 missed approach. Had the
procedures been more specific, the flighterew might have received the additional
information needed to recognize that they were excessively below the glideslope and that
a missed approach was reqttired. Some carriers, for example, require a missed approach if
the localizer or glideslope is deflected by more than 1 dot on the ILS display. With proper
erew coordination, the nonflying pilot would call out specific deviations in the flightpath
to alert the flying pilot to execute the missed approach. The Safety Board believes that Simmons should provide such specific
information in its operations manual so that pilots can execute missed approaches
according to predefined localizer and glideslope deviations. Nevertheless, irrespective of
specific missed approach criteria, the fact remains that the glideslope indications
available to flight 1746 would have shown that the airvlane was well below glideslope. Therefore, specific missed approach criteria would not have been necessary to inform the
flighterew that they needed to execute a second missed approach.

conditions measured in the 2050 weather observation at Alpena could guickly deteriorate
and Alpena would then be below minimums. In addition, the captain may not have
realized that the first officer&#x27;s inexperience limited his ability to participate fully in the
captain&#x27;s decisionmaking process. Unfortunately, the Safety Board cannot state with eertainty the flightcrew
actions that took place at the time of the accident. Without a cockpit voice recorder and
a flight data recorder, the Board was unable to learn precisely what the flighterew said,
what callouts they made, what procedures they followed before the accident, and the
precise flightpath of the airplane. Consequently, the Board can onty assess the possible
flighterew actions that could have contributed to the continued descent below the
decision height, based on the limited information available.

2.3.9 Flightcrew Conduct of the Flight

Several factors in the operation of Might 1746 indicate that the flightcrew&#x27;s
conduct of the flight was improper. For example, the esptain&#x27;s reliance on the first
officer&#x27;s approach chart during both approaches violated the intent of company procedures
and showed 4 disregard for safe operating practices. His deseription of his reliance on the
first officer&#x27;s aporoach chart during the approach as manifesting &quot;crew coordination&quot;
shows both a lack of appreciation of the importance of the ready availability of the chart
to the proper execution of the approach as well as 4 fundamental misunderstanding of
crew coordination and its application to flight operations. The captain, as pilot-in-command, had the responsibility to bring about and
maintain effective crew coordination throughout the flight. That the aircraft continued
to descend below the glideslope and through decision height suggests, even without benefit
of a cockpit voice recorder, that proper crew coordination was nut followed. The Board
has addressed the importance of crew coordination, defined as &quot;the effective utitization
of flighterew members and other resources to enhance crew interaction, communication
and decision-making in muiti-crew aireraft operations” in other accidents involving
carriers operating under 14 CFR 135 as well as under 14 CFR 121. As a result of its investigation of an accident in Rockland, Maine, in 1979, 11/
the Safety Board on May 27, i¥80, Issued the following recommendation (A-80-42) to the
FAA:

~34-

Require that 14 CFR 135 operators emphasize crew coordination
during recurrent training, especially when pilots are qualified for
both single-pilot/autopilot and two-pilot operations. These
requirements should be outlined in an operator&#x27;s approved training
eurriculum,

On August 31, 1981, the FAA issued a change to handbook 8430,1B, Inspection
and Surveillance Procedures—Air Taxi Operators/Commuter Air Carriers and Commercial
Operators, that alerted operation inspectors to ensure that operator&#x27;s training programs
include, for operations with more than one pilot, provisions for emphasizing crew
coordination procedures in all phases of flight.

with gratuities to deviate from their intended route; however, such a practice could
not be substantiated. Also at the time of his departure from Hilo the pilot was aware that
upon deplaning his passengers in HNL, he was to fly to Maui to board additional
tourists and return them to HNL. Consequently, the captain knew that adhering to
his intended route schedule was a necessity. Investigators were told that SAT pilots
were well aware that the expense and profit of each tour flight were predicated upon
adhering to the designated flight route. The pilots knew that deviations from the
route directly affected the profitability of the operation and could therefore
adversely affect their job security. After careful consideration, the Safety Board was unable to identify
any reason why the captain would intentionally establish and maintain a direct
course toward mountainous terrain. Because of the prevailing weather conditions,
the mountains were neither visible to him nor scheduled to be over flown on the
tour. For these reasons, the Safety Board considered whether the deviation was
unintentional. The difference in heading between the planned flight track and the
actual flight tract was approximately 23 degrees. The disparity between the two
headings should have been readily apparent to the captain. Reasonable explanations
for his failure to recognize the difference include relying on his memory rather than
using the VFR navigation sectional chart or atiother aid to verify the proper flight
headings; failing to compare the inherent precession errors of the gyroscopic
direction indicator with the magnetic compass to verify the actual heading; and
reduced visibility from the usual weather pattern that normally allowed the captain
to fly between the islands solely by use of outside references.

34

The captain may have failed to reset the directional gyro in a regular
and timely manner to compensate for precession, !? making his heading indicator
unreliable and contributing to a course error. N342E was not intended to be flown
in instrument conditions; therefore, the reliability of its heading indicator, and its
susceptibility to precession, was not known with any degree of accuracy; and
destruction of the instrumentation at impact prechided a determination of its preaccident condition. The pilot who flew the airplane the day before the accident
found it necessary to reset the heading indicator every 10 to 20 minutes, indicating
that precession effects were sufficient to require regular adjustments. The Safety Board believes that the captain did not refer to an
aeronautical chart or other references for navigation information while performing
this flight. Evidence indicates that instead he relied on his memory to navigate. Three Hawaiian island VFR sectional charts were discovered in the
wreckage; all the charts were folded in the captain&#x27;s bag. The captain had
previously prepared a memory aid that displayed navigation information in a ready
reference format. It was not in his possession ai the time of the accident but was
discovered af his home. No other navigation references were found in the
wreckage. However, the most plausible explanation for the unintentional routing is
a failure of the captain to tum the omni bearing selector (OBS) to the desired course
radial while tracking outbound on the UPP VOR.</div>

when he applied for a pilot position at Scenic Air Tours. Company personnel were not aware of these falsifications .
because they did not pursue substantive preemployment
background checks of the aeronautical experience of the pilot,
nor were they required by the FAA to do so. Although Scenic Air Tour flights were required to be conducted
under VFR, the captain continued the flight into instrument
meteorological conditions that prevailed along the eastern and
southern slope of Mt. Haleakala on the Island of Maui. The captain either did not see or did not evaluate the significance
of an upsloping cloud layer that was produced by orographic
lifting phenomenon of Mt. Haleakala. The captain apparently did not make visual contact with the
rising terrain on Mt. Haleakala until the finat seconds of the
flight because it was obscured by clouds.

4i

9. The captain mistakenly deviated from his intended route
apparently because he did not use his navigation charts to
confirm the correct heading and radial outbound from Upolu
Point. His navigation error went undetected because he failed to
adequately crosscheck progress of the flight using navigation
aids available to him.

10. The work of the Honolulu FSDO was insufficient to discover
deficiencies found by the FAA Regional Aviation Safety
Inspection Program and the Safety Board&#x27;s investigation of this
accident. It. tis difficult to calculate specific accident exposure data for air
tour operators, and other industry comparisons are not possible,
because an FAA national data base from which to evaluate the
magnitude of air tour operations does not exist.

12. Regulations are needed for air tour operators that will enable
FAA inspectors to require, rather than merely encourage,
operators to adhere to procedures that offer the safety
improvements of SFAR 50-2 and FAA Handbook 8400.10
Bulletin 92-01. 3.2 Probable Cause

The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable
cause of this accident was the captain&#x27;s decision to continue visual flight into
instrument meteorological conditions that obscured rising mountainous terra&#x27;n and
his failure to properly use available navigational information to remain clear of the

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] To a pilot knowledgeable
about the characteristics of weather formation in the Hawaiian Islands, the briefing
would have indicated that the IFR weather affecting the islands was predominantly
land based. The cloud cover that the captain encountered, and was apparently
attempting to climb over as he proceeded in a northwesterly direction from Upolu
Point, should have been an indication to him that he was heading toward Maui and
Mt. Haleakala. Under the existirg atmospheric conditions, no other land mass in the
area could have generated the orographic lifting of clouds at the altitude in which he
encountered them. However, haze and clouds between the airplane and Mount
Haleakala could have obscured the observation of a distinctive cloud mass over the
island. As the pilot passed abeam Upolu Point, his next normal landfall would
have been Kahoolawe, which underlies R-3104. The island was about 45 nmi west
of his position. The terrain elevation is less than 2,000 feet msl. The Safety Board
believes that the captain could not see the island because of haze and scattered
clouds. Therefore, he would have had to rely on memory for the correct heading or
have referenced the appropriate VFR navigation chart for the area. The Safety
Board believes that given the weather conditions along the intended route of flight
and the relative close proximity to mountainous terrain, the captain should have
referred to the navigation chart to verify the appropriate navigation facility,

frequency and initial heading to be flown. The Safety Board did not find any iz x
evidence that such a navigational cross check took place. NS

The Safety Board believes that the captain&#x27;s response to an inquiry of
from a following company flight using words to the effect, &quot;I am 37 DME off
Upolu, standby Lanai,&quot; indicates that the captain did not have a recognizable land
mass in sight. The choice of words also indicates that the captain was navigating ‘-
outbound off the UPP VOR. The location of the actual crash site (89 DME) i I
indicates that the accident occurred a very short time after that radio transmission ve
took place. I

Although the Safety Board cannot positively determine which of these
potential navigational errors may have occurred, the Board believes that the
deviation was unintentional and that a combination of operational errors was
responsible for the deviation from the established tour route by Scenic 22 while the
flight was operating in IMC. The Safety Board believes that the captain&#x27;s judgment J
was faulty when, in violation of FAR Part 91, he chose to continue WFP flight into ! bs i
IMC during climbout in an area of high terrain. }} 4 I

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] Based upon the first
officer&#x27;s testimony at the public hearing, the Safety Board believes that the
flightcrew, thinking that the flight was still receiving ATC guidance, intended to rely
on ATC to provide the necessary course vectors in order to either visually acquire
the Anniston airport or to guide them to the initial approach fix. The Safety Board believes that at this time in the flight the captain lost
situational awareness because of his uncertainty about the ATC instructions, his
uncertainty about the airplane&#x27;s course and its position relative to the airport, and the
first officer&#x27;s statement that the inbound course was 085°. Additionally, this
conversation indicates that the first officer was not providing the captain with the
requested information or adequately assisting the captain in the management of the
flight. The fact that the captain did not insist on clarification about ATC
instructions, whether the radar services had been terminated, or about the first
officer&#x27;s statement concerning the airplane&#x27;s intended course, further indicates that
the captain had lost, or was losing, control of the situation. He had, in effect, tumed
the management of the flight over to the first officer. It is possible that the first
officer meant to say the course was on the 085° radial from the Talladega VOR,
rather than a &quot;course&quot; of 085°. The actual heading would have been the reciprocal
or 265°. Providing the captain with the radial rather than the actual course only
increased the captain&#x27;s confusion about the proper course and the airplane&#x27;s position. The direct airway from the Talledega VOR to the Hartsfield Atlanta International
Airport is on the 085° radial. At 0842:44, the controller informed the flightcrew that radar services
were terminated and to contact Birmingham Approach Control. The captain did not
comment on this information, and at the public hearing, the first officer stated that
he (the first officer) believed that the flight had been receiving course vectors from
ATC. Shortly thereafter, the first officer asked if the captain wanted to conduct the
ILS approach, to which the captain replied in the affirmative. The flightcrew then

30

became occupied with accomplishing the in-range checklist8 and tuning the radios
for the ILS approach. There was no indication on the CVR recording that the
flightcrew had selected the appropriate radio frequency of the BOGGA
nondirectional beacon or that they confirmed that they were receiving the correct

signal. At 0847:46, the approach controller informed the flightcrew of the
latest weather for Anniston.</div>

latest weather for Anniston. The first officer acknowledged the transmission, then
at 0848:10, he asked the captain, “you want to go around for the ILS?&quot; About the
same time, the controller told flight 861 to &quot;proceed direct BOGGA maintain four
thousand ‘til BOGGA, cleared localizer run- er ILS runway five approach.&quot; The
first officer&#x27;s suggestion that the captain should go around for the ILS prior to
crossing BOGGA is an indication that the first officer was also uncertain about the
position of the airplane in relation to the navigational facilities or the airport. The captain then asked the first officer to contact the controller and
inquire about flight 861&#x27;s distance from BOGGA. This statement indicates that the
captain was still uncertain about the airplane&#x27;s position. His statement also indicates
that he believed that ATC was still in radar contact with the flight, despite the
controller&#x27;s previous advisory to the flightcrew that radar contact had been
terminated. It is possible that the captain mistakenly believed that he could still
receive radar assistance from the controller. Rather than contact the controller, the
first officer mentally computed the airplane&#x27;s distance from BOGGA, apparently
with respect to the distance measuring equipment&#x27;s indicated distance from the
Talladega VOR. The Safety Board believes that had the first officer contacted the
controller, it would have been apparent that radar contact had been lost and that the
captain needed to confirm his position with the navigational equipment on board the
airplane. The CVR comments also indicate that the ILS approach briefing was not
conducted nor had the captain reviewed the ILS approach chart. These events
suggest a breakdown in crew coordination, which further set the stage for the
accident. ©

From the CVR transcript, it appears that the first officer recognized
that the captain was having difficulty with the workload and started providing
instructions to the captain to help him with the approach. Indeed, during the public
hearing, the first officer testified that he recognized that the captain needed help
with the approach. At 0848:49, the first officer asked the captain, “didn&#x27;t realize

that you&#x27;re going to get this much on your first day did ya?&quot; The captain
acknowledged that &quot;it&#x27;s all kind of ganged up here on me a little fast.&quot; This
comment is another indication that the captain was beginning to lose awareness of
the situation and was overloaded by the events. Yet, neither pilot requested
assistance from ATC in determining the position of the airplane.</div>

                        <div class="chunk-text">[CONCLUSIONS] The investigation determined that in actuality, the airplane
had intercepted the back course localizer signal for the ILS approach, and the
flightcrew had commenced the approach at a high airspeed about 2,000 feet above
the specified altitude for crossing the final approach fix. The airplane continued a
controlled descent until it impacted terrain. The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable
causes of this accident were the failure of senior management of GP Express to
provide adequate training and operational support for the startup of the southem
operation, which resulted in the assignment of an inadequately prepared captain with
a relatively inexperienced first officer in revenue passenger service, and the failure

of the flightcrew to use approved instrument flight procedures, which resulted in a
loss of situational awareness and terrain clearance. Contributing to the causes of the
accident was GP Express’ failure to provide approach charts to each pilot and to
establish stabilized approach criteria. Also contributing were the inadequate crew
coordination and a role reversal on the part of the captain and first officer. As a result of its investigation of this accident, the Safety Board made
five recommendations to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA): to require the
availability of two sets of approach charts on aircraft requiring two pilots, to require
the development and use of stabilized approach criteria, to develop evaluation
criteria for cockpit resource management (CRM) training programs, captain flight
training, and a minimum experience requirement for commuter air carrier captains. Additionally, the Safety Board reiterated a recommendation to the FAA to require
that scheduled 14 CFR Part 135 operators develop and use CRM training programs
and a recommendation to establish minimum experience levels for pairing
flightcrews. V1

1. FACTUAL INFORMATION 1.1 History of the Flight

On June 8, 1992, GP Express Airlines, Inc., flight 861, a Beechcraft
model C99, N118GP, crashed while maneuvering to land at the Anniston
Metropolitan Airport, Anniston, Alabama. The accident occurred about 0852
central daylight time. The flight was a scheduled passenger flight from Atlanta,
Georgia, to Anniston, Alabama, operating under the provisions of Title 14 Code of
Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 135. The flight was operated in accordance with an
instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan, as required by the airline&#x27;s procedures. The
captain and two passengers received fatal injuries. The first officer and two
passengers were seriously injured. The airplane was destroyed by impact and
postcrash fire. The crew of flight 861 reported for duty on June 8, 1992, about 0400 at
the GP Express operation facility at the Tuscaloosa Municipal Airport in
Tuscaloosa, Alabama. They were scheduled to fly GP Express flights 860 and 861.</div>

never reached MDA or 100 feet above MDA, which would further explain why
these calloute were naver mide. Additionally, the captain may have failed
to detect tia discrepancy between the p:escribed and actual aititudes be«
cause of his preoccupation with the checklist and with looking outside

the cockpit,

It should be emphasized that the possible explanation discussed imnediately above is based not only on evidence that is tenuous, at beat, but
aleo on the inferences to be drawn from such evidenc. as to what thought
processes were evolving in the mlnds of the flightcrew. Obviously, such
an explanation is, to a considerable degree, speculative in nature. It
is nevertheless the intent of the Board that, by including this discussion
in the report, pilots will be alerted against the possibility of lapsing
into such a pattern when utilizing a QFE altimeter setting procedure. We
also hasten to add that, even if it is assuned that the sequence of events
described in the above discussion in fact occurred, this should be taken
to reflect adversely not on Eastern&#x27;s system, but rather on the flightcrew&#x27;s implementation of that system in this instance, By vixtue of
training, experience, cockpit instrumentation, navigational aids, and approach plates, this crew was well equipped to accomplish the approach to
Charlotte safely, and there is no causal factor beyond the flightcrew it~
self which would account for their failure to do so. This accident exenplifies the absolute necessity of strict adherence to prescribed procedures, particularly those pertaining to altitude awareness, during an
instrument approach,

Survivability
Three major factors made this a partially survivable accident:

{{. The occupiable area of the cabir. was compromised when
the fuselage broke up,

2, The intense postimpact fire consumed the occuplable area of
the tail section and the entire center section of the cabin,

3, The occupant restraint systam failed in many instances,
° evon though crash forces were within human tolerances. The cockpit, area and the forward cabin were demolished by inact
with tree, The tail section, which included the last f£ve rows of passenger s@its, is classed as a survivable crea, Howaver, postcrash fire

the approach, It is possible that the crew, beceuse of the extended dura~
tion of flight in VMC &gt;ove a low, patchy fog bank through which intermittent ground contact way possible, may have relaxed their instrument scan
and relied more heavily upon visval cues to fly the approach, Such a possibility is consistent, not only with the discussion of Carowinds Tower
described above, but also with the captain&#x27;s remark, shortly before in
pact, that &quot;All we got to do is find the airport,&quot; and the firet officor&#x27;e
response of “Yean.&quot;’ Ultimately, when the aircraft penetrated the densa
fog around the eccident site, visual reference would hava been lost and a
switch to instrument flight would not have been possible within the availeable tima, Tha mount likely explarction of why Flight 212 was unable to
establish visual contact with tha runway environrent, whereas other
flights were able to do so and thereby complete the approach, is that
Flight 212, flying at a lower altitude, initially entered the fog bank at
a point farther from the runway threshold and thus had a greater slante
range distance through shich to sight the runway markings through the fog. Another possible reason for the crew&#x27;s lack of altitude awareness
involves the interrelationship between QNH (above sea level) and QFE
(above field elevation) altitudes during the approach.

The extraneous conversacion conducted by the flightcrew
during the descent was symptomatic of a lax atmosphere in
the cockpit which continued throughout the approach. The terrain warning alert sounded at 1,000 feet above the
ground but was not heeded by the flightcrew,

The aircraft descended through the final approach fix altitude of 1,800 feet more than 2 miles before the final approach fix was reached at an airspeed of 186 knots. The aircraft passed over the final approach fix at an altitude of 1,350 feat (or 450 feet below the prescribed crossing altitude) and at an airspeed of 168 knots, as compared
to the Veer speed of 122 knots,

Required callouts were not mide at the final aoproach fix,
at an altitude of 500 feet above field elevation, ov at 100
feet above the minimum des. ent altitude,

A severe postimpact fire occurred immediately after the
initial impact.

10, Fatal injuries were caused by impact and thermal tvauma,

11. The door exits, axcept for the auxiliary exit in the tail,
were blocked externally,

12, Doubleknit polyester clothing increased the severity of
burns, (b) Probable Cause

The National Transportation Safaty Board determi ies that the probable cause of the accident was the flighcarew&#x27;s Lack of altitude awareness at critical points during the approach due to poor cockpit discipline
in that the craw did not follow prescribed procedures,

- 21» 3. RECOMMENDATIONS

On October 8, 1974, tha Board fasued two safety recommendations to
the PAA (A-74-85 and A-74-8) to initiate ways and means to improve professional standards among pilots. hese recommendations cited five previous air carrier approach accidents as examles of a cael acceptance
of the flight environment, and added that the Charlotte ciush &quot;reflects
once again serious lapses in expected professional conduct.&quot; The PAA
agrees with both recommendations and is in the process of establishing a
working lfaison on this subjact with beth airline management ad air
carrier pilot organizations,

east-northeast when it impacted terrain. Thus, it was on a heading that pointed away from any 
relevant destination or previous flight track. An impact study that evaluated the airplane’s crush 
damage and the ground scar evidence determined that the airplane impacted terrain at a pitch 
attitude of about 17° airplane nose up and bank angle of about 30° left wing down. Also, an 
airplane performance study that produced a number of possible flightpath scenarios determined 
that flight control inputs and airplane maneuvering immediately before terrain impact were 
probable. The NTSB concludes that that the airplane was in a climbing left turn when it collided 
with terrain and that flight control inputs occurred shortly before terrain impact. Because only limited information was available, the sequence of events after the 
airplane’s last recorded position up to the moment of likely control input and terrain impact is 
unknown. FAA Advisory Circular 61-134, “General Aviation Controlled Flight into Terrain 
Awareness,” indicates that controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) occurs when “an airworthy 
aircraft is flown, under the control of a qualified pilot, into terrain (water or obstacles) with 
inadequate awareness on the part of the pilot of the impending collision.” Based on this 
definition, the circumstances of this accident could be consistent with a CFIT event if the 
accident pilot actively controlled the airplane but navigated inappropriately at some point after

the airplane’s last known position. However, the airplane performance study indicates that the 
airplane also could have reached the accident site if the pilot provided little or no input on the 
flight controls (that is, did not actively control the airplane, which would be inconsistent with a 
CFIT event) for a period of nearly 3 minutes after the airplane’s last known position and then 
made flight control inputs only in the moments before impact. Because none of the flightpath 
scenarios evaluated by the airplane performance study can be considered more probable or more 
compelling than another, the following human performance analysis discusses factors that could 
affect the pilot’s possible deliberate actions or explain his possible lack of action during the final 
3 minutes of the flight up to the final 4 to 6 seconds before impact. 
2.3 Human Performance 
The accident pilot’s reported experience included decades of flying in Alaska, with 
several years of flying in the vicinity of Lake Nerka and recent flight operations in the vicinity of 
the accident area. Several pilots who were professional and personal acquaintances of the 
accident pilot described him as a pilot who had excellent stick-and-rudder skills, exceptional 
knowledge of the Alaska area and terrain, and an innate sense of situational awareness. 
2.3.1 Challenges Inherent in the Alaska Flying Environment 
The NTSB has had a longstanding interest in the safety of aviation operations in Alaska. In a 1995 safety study,82 the NTSB noted that flight operations83 in Alaska are subject to a 
challenging aviation environment. Rough terrain and adverse weather can increase the risks to 
safe flight operations, particularly for flights conducted under VFR.</div>

the GPS navigational aid and the pilot’s familiarity with the area and the flight route should have 
provided him sufficient references to plan for avoiding terrain if he encountered IMC or another 
problem. If the pilot were performing at his reported typical level of proficiency and needed, for 
some reason, to deviate from the airplane’s usual course to the fishing camp, he likely would 
have been aware that a turn to the right would overfly the low tundra (allowing for maneuvering 
or a safe descent, as needed), whereas a turn to the left would fly directly toward high terrain. The NTSB concludes that a deliberate execution of a left turn toward the rising terrain by the 
accident pilot in any weather condition would require a lack of situational awareness that is 
inconsistent with the pilot’s reported level of proficiency, typical safety practices, and familiarity 
with the area. As previously discussed, from the airplane’s last known position, one possible flightpath 
scenario that could place the airplane at the accident site involved only a slight amount of left 
flight control input initiated near the airplane’s last known position. Such a scenario could result 
if the pilot had become spatially disoriented and allowed an uncorrected left bank to develop. For 
example, the “leans,” one of the most common illusions that pilots experience, can occur in 
degraded visibility when a pilot inadvertently rolls the airplane into a slight bank without 
awareness of the bank and believes that the airplane is flying straight and level.86 However, the 
“leans” can occur only while a pilot neglects to scan or disbelieves the cockpit instruments that 
provide correct orientation guidance. Such inattention to flight instruments would be unlikely for 
a pilot of the accident pilot’s experience level. Regardless of the pilot’s actions or intentions, the heading of the airplane at impact 
suggests that the pilot was largely unaware that the airplane was approaching the rising terrain. This apparent lack of awareness suggests that the accident pilot’s perceptions and/or responses 
became substantially impaired at some point after the airplane’s last known Sky Connect 
position. Using the limited information available, the NTSB explored what types of impairment 
could have led the pilot to allow the airplane to turn unnoticed toward the higher terrain before 
the final 4 to 6 seconds of the flight when he applied aggressive flight control inputs. The pilot

intervals during the accident flight. These data, when compared with the Sky Connect data 
available for three of the pilot’s four previous passenger-carrying flights from the lodge to the

fishing camp, showed that the accident flight’s route appeared to be the most northern and 
eastern route taken by the pilot by at least 1 nm (because of the interval of the data samples, the 
precise flight routes are not known). According to the passenger seated in the cockpit, the pilot 
had stated he was taking off in a different direction than usual because of weather. The wind was generally from the south-southwest, which would likely create turbulence 
over Lake Nerka, which was immediately downwind of higher terrain on the southwest shore of 
the lake. The GCI pilot with whom the accident pilot flew from the lodge to DLG that morning 
reported that the turbulence they encountered may have been a comfort issue for passengers, and 
the accident pilot, during his return trip from DLG to the lodge, reported (in the form of a 
PIREP) encountering “extremely irritating” turbulence. Thus, the apparent more northern and 
eastern positioning of the accident flight’s initial path may have been the result of an intentional 
pilot action to minimize the turbulence for the passengers. The Sky Connect position reports for the accident flight showed that, after taking off, the 
airplane was at an altitude of about 1,080 feet msl at one point and that, as it proceeded 
southeast, its next recorded altitudes were 780 feet msl and 920 feet msl (at the last point 
recorded). Flight at such changing altitudes would be consistent with the pilot maneuvering to 
remain in VMC below the clouds and suggests the possibility of variable cloud ceilings along the 
flight route. Although the initial accident flight route appeared to be offset to the north and east (when 
compared to the accident pilot’s previous routes to the fishing camp), the last recorded position 
and ground track for the airplane were such that, if that ground track were maintained, the 
airplane would have traveled through the wide pass west of the Muklung Hills (near the 
“MUKLG” GPS waypoint), which would be consistent with the pilot’s previous routes. However, the airplane instead tracked to the east and collided with terrain about 4 nm southeast 
of its last recorded position. Ground scar evidence from the accident site indicated that the airplane was traveling 
east-northeast when it impacted terrain. Thus, it was on a heading that pointed away from any 
relevant destination or previous flight track. An impact study that evaluated the airplane’s crush

conversation about the localizer 18 approach option to the runway and their concern that ATC 
had left them high on the approach. Although this conversation involved operational issues, it 
focused on past activities and would have been a distraction to the flight crew’s focus on the 
present and future actions necessary to successfully complete the remainder of the flight. The 
cues associated with the flight crew’s failure to verify the flight plan would have been especially 
salient as the airplane aligned with the localizer, and the flight crew’s discussion came at an 
inopportune time. The NTSB concludes that the captain, as PF, should have called for the first 
officer’s verification of the flight plan in the FMC, and the first officer, as PM, should have 
verified the flight plan in the FMC; their conversation regarding nonpertinent operational issues 
distracted them from recognizing that the FMC was not resequenced even though several salient 
cues were available.

2.3.2.1 Failure to Capture the Glidepath 
At 0443:24, the approach controller cleared the flight for the approach stating, “maintain 
two thousand five hundred till established on localizer, cleared localizer one eight approach.” 
The airplane was 11 mi from the BASKN FAF at this time. According to radar and CVR data, 
the airplane became established on the localizer when it descended through 3,800 ft and, 
consistent with the minimum altitude for that segment of the approach, could have descended to

the FAF minimum crossing altitude of 2,300 ft when inside of COLIG. However, the captain did 
not do so, and he maintained 2,500 ft. The UPS A300 AOM and PTG recommended descending to the FAF crossing altitude 
before intercepting the profile glidepath on nonprecision approaches because intercepting the 
profile glidepath outside the FAF did not guarantee step-down fix compliance for those fixes that 
occur before the FAF. Although the flight crew repeatedly commented about being high on the 
approach, they did not discuss descending to 2,300 ft after they became established on the 
localizer between COLIG and BASKN. Additionally, it is important to note that, at this stage in 
the approach and well before the FAF of BASKN, the airplane was only 200 ft above the 
minimum altitude, which could have been corrected with minimal effort.</div>

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] While on final approach, particularly in IMC, it is imperative that pilots vigilantly 
monitor the flight instruments to ensure that the airplane remains on course and on speed and so 
that any deviation from the desired lateral and vertical paths can be corrected promptly. For a 
localizer approach flown in profile mode, the primary source for lateral course correction 
information is the localizer deviation diamond, and the primary source for vertical path correction 
information is the VDI on the ND. From the time that the first officer activated the final approach, the VDI diamond was 
pegged at the top of its scale, indicating that the airplane was at least 200 ft below the glidepath 
constructed by the FMC. When the airplane was at 2,500 ft msl and still more than 1 nm from 
BASKN, this would be the expected VDI indication because the (correct) glidepath would indeed 
be more than 200 ft above the airplane. However, within 1 nm of BASKN, the pilots should have 
expected that the VDI diamond would start to move down toward the center of the scale, as the 
airplane intercepted the glidepath from below. On the accident flight, however, the VDI would 
have remained pegged at the top of the scale even as the airplane passed BASKN. At BASKN, the 
pilots were very aware that they were above, not below, the desired glidepath, but neither seemed 
to comment about the VDI indication. It is not known whether either pilot ever looked at the VDI throughout the approach, 
including when they were discussing the airplane being high at 0446:54. It is also unknown what

information the pilots were using to conclude that the airplane was high at that time, when the 
primary source of such information (the VDI) would have indicated that it was at least 200 ft 
low.115 
If the captain realized that the VDI was unusable but decided to proceed with the approach 
anyway, he would have had to revert from a CDFA-type approach to a “dive and drive” 
technique, relying on the step-down altitudes for vertical guidance. Consistent with an awareness 
of the step-down altitudes, at 0446:46.8, while descending through 1,920 ft msl (1,390 ft agl), the 
captain stated, “alright so at three point three should be at thirteen eighty,” referencing the 
minimum crossing altitude at IMTOY at 1,380 ft msl. The airplane crossed IMTOY very close to 
this altitude, at which point it intersected the proper glidepath; however, the captain did not 
decrease the rate of descent, and the airplane passed through the glidepath descending at 
1,500 fpm.</div>

90 3.2 Probable Cause 
The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of this 
accident was the flight crew’s continuation of an unstabilized approach and their failure to 
monitor the aircraft’s altitude during the approach, which led to an inadvertent descent below the 
minimum approach altitude and subsequently into terrain. Contributing to the accident were 
(1) the flight crew’s failure to properly configure and verify the flight management computer for 
the profile approach; (2) the captain’s failure to communicate his intentions to the first officer 
once it became apparent the vertical profile was not captured; (3) the flight crew’s expectation 
that they would break out of the clouds at 1,000 feet above ground level due to incomplete 
weather information; (4) the first officer’s failure to make the required minimums callouts; 
(5) the captain’s performance deficiencies likely due to factors including, but not limited to, 
fatigue, distraction, or confusion, consistent with performance deficiencies exhibited during 
training; and (6) the first officer’s fatigue due to acute sleep loss resulting from her ineffective 
off-duty time management and circadian factors. NTSB

it require that he request it. The pilot was iesponsible to familiarice
hinself with the terrain features in the Nogales
area. The departure controller instructed the pilot to
maintain VFR Flight conditions. Since the pilot did
nos request a VFR restriction the controlier&#x27;s
action did not comply with the provisions of ATC
Handbock 7110.65. The departure controller exercised his emergency
authority and vectored N999MB to reverse course.
ibe course reversal was timely, since the aircraft
successfully avoided the high terrain which was
directly on its course. The departure controller did not provide appropriate
services to the pilot. The pilot should have been
cleared to climb when he reported he could not
maintain VFR flight conditions.

12. The pilot did not execute the avoidance turn successfully, and lost control of his aircraft either in or
just after the turn. 3.2 Probable cause

the National Transportation Safety Bi 1 determines that the
probable cause of the accident was the controllers’ issuance of an
improper departure clearance, climb restriction,and altitude clearance,
The controllers’ lack of knowledge and noncompliance with standard ATe
procedures placed the aircraft in proximity to high terrain and the
pilot lost contro! of the aircraft for unkrown reasons while executing
an emergency, controlier-directed turn. Contributing to the accident were (1) the inadequacy of
official guidelines concerning the use of the published IFR departure
procedures, (2) the failure of the departure controlier to provide
appropriate services, (3) the inability of the flight service specialist
to insert the pilot&#x27;s requested departure route into the ATC flight
data computer, and (4) the failure of the pilot to check the new
departure clearance and route for proper terrain clearance altitudes. 4. RECOMMENDATIONS

As a result of its investigation of this accident, the National
Transportation Safety Board recommended, on November 7, 1977, that the
Federal Aviation Adninistration:

&quot;Revise the Airman&#x27;s Information Manual and issue or revise
other official guidance materials to clarify pilots’ and
controllers’ responsibilities in implecenting an IFR departure
from an airport which has a published IFR departure procedure.

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] The
controller did prevent the aircraft from hitting the peak, out his
efforts ta achieve this may have confused, and probably increased, the
stress on the pilot. While the pilot was dependent on the controller
during this portion of the fiight, had he fully familiarized himself
with the terrain he might bave been able to help the departure controller
by telling him what he thought must be done rather than merely telliug
the controllex what he was unable to do. The evidence of this accident
illustraces that the safe condurt of a flight in controlled airspace is
a dua}} responsibility which can only be exercised properly when both the
pilot and the controller have complete knowledge of their individual
duty requirements. The Safety Board has, in previous accident reports, voiced its
concern over the dangers created by breakdowns in communications between
pilots and controllers, and the failure of pilots and controllers to
exchange information both accurately and completely. This arcident
demonstrates that the failure to communicate, or to exchange information,

is not limited to the area of oral communications. The directives and
official guidelines contained in the applicable publications created an
area of confusion concerning the use of the published IFR departure
procedure. The controller&#x27;s belief that the pilot would fly the route
contained in the departure procedure evidently contributed to his
assignment of an aititude which did not provide the required obstacle
clearance. The Safety Board believes that the procedures and guidelines
contained in the AIM and the ATC Handbook are unclear and lead to interpretations which are not consistent with the requirements of 14 CFR 91.75. The Safety Board believes that these factors led to the foregoing misunderstanding, and, accordingly has recommended that the FAA initiate action to
remedy this deficiency. 3. Conclusions Findings

1. The pilots, FSS specialists, and air traffic controllers
were certificated i accordance with current vegulations. The aiccraft was certificated and maintained in
accordance with currest regulations. The pilot&#x27;s requested departure route was from
Nogales to Flats Intersection. The FSS specinulists
did not know the proper method to insert Flats
Intersection inte the center&#x27;s flight data computer. The FSS specialist suggested a change to the pilot’s
requested route of flight in order to permit the
flight data computer to accept the clearance. The
pilot was aware of and ceccepted the change. The
route of flight was changed to Nogales direct to
Tucson. The issuance of the VFR climb restriction
was not in accordance with the contents of the AIM
and ATC Handbook 7110.65, Paragraph 351. The 10,000-foot 1fR altitude assignment did
not meet the 2,000-foot terrain clearance requirements of 14 CFR 91.119. The terminology contained in the AIM describing the
use of published IFR departure procedures is unclear
as to whether the pilot is required to inform air
traffic control of his intent to use a published IFR
departure procedure, or whether he can fly the
procedure without specific air traffic control
authorization.</div>

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] He saw the aircraft&#x27;s data block 1 minute
later, and it was further south of the position he had originally acquired
the aircraft&#x27;s target. Its altitude readout was 8,600 ft. The aircraft
impacted on a heading of 095° in a right wing low and noseup attitude. The crash site was about the same distance from Mt. Wrightson as the
point where the controller issued the vector, and its elevation was
3,400 feet below the altitude at which the turn to avoid the peak was
started,

The evidence indicates that the aircraft continued to turn
rather than procees ig on a 180° headirg. The evidence is conclusive
that the aircraft turned 270°, or perhaps more, and descended 3,400 ft
during the turn. The loss of radar contact with the aircraft, and the
pilot&#x27;s failure to respond to the controller&#x27;s attempts to contact him
indicates that the turn and descent occurred within 53 seconds to 2
minutes 3 seccrds after the pilot said he was turning to i80°.

The location of the crash site further corroborates the fact
that the vector was issued in time to allow the aircraft to turn and
avoid the peak. Based on the above evidence, the Safety Board concludes
that the pilot either became spatially disoriented during the left turn
or allowed his aircraft to enter a spiral during the tura, or both, and
the aircraft crsshed during an attempted recovery maneuver either on
instruments or after it emerged from the base of the clouds. The pilot&#x27;s original request to fly the route of the published
depurture procedure and the fact that he had operated into and out of
the airport several times appears to indicate that he had some knowledge
of the terrain; however, the published departure route also represented

the most direct route coward his destination. Therefore, e conclusion
concerning his level of terrain awarene3s cannot te made. In addition,
the FSS specialist&#x27;s assurance that he would not have to proceed to
Tucson probably promoted the belief that he would be vectored tu the
northwest coward the airvay before reaching Tucson. Regardless, the
regu_atiuns required the pilot to familiarize himself with, “all available
information concerning the flight,&quot; before takeoff. He should have
familiarized himself with the height of the terrain in the NogalesTucson area and along his new route. Despite the assurance that he
would be vectored &quot;across the corner,&quot; he did not know the exact point
on the new route these vectors would be issued, and how far north of
Nogales that point would be. The clearance delivered to the pilot changed his originally
requested rcute of flight. The pilot accepted the change to the clearance
before takeoff, and the amended clearance was delivered to him 27 minutes
later. There was more than enough time for him to check his new rou’ing
for terrain clearance. It was the pilot&#x27;s responsibility to assure
hiase?f that the new routing he received did not endanger his aircraft.</div>

conversation that both pilots had the proper approach plates available and
that the captain was referring to the approach plate during the briefing. I[t
is reasonable to presume that the first officer was also looking at his plate
during the captain&#x27;s briefing. Althougn the captain’s briefing was detailed
tr most respects, there were some omissions. First, the captain stated his
intention to deviate from the procedure turn, as depicted on the appreach
chart, and fly a teardrop course reversal instead of turning outbound on the
localizer upon reaching the initial approach fix. The captain did not
however, describe his intended procedure for timing the outbound jeg and
initiating the turn inbound, and the first officer did not question the
captain about his intent. This omission was of minor significance except
that it diminished the first officer’s role in monitoring the captain’s
conduct of this portion of the approach. The second omission in the briefing was the captain’s failure to
define the geographic location of the final approach fix (DRIGE inbound) as
5 DME. This omission was significant in subsequent events. Although the

captain stated the proper altitude limitation at ORIGE (1,500 feet}}, he later
associated that altitude limitaticn with 10 DME. It was this premature
descent below 1,500 feet that led to the accident. The Safety Board
believes that if the captain had identified ORIGE erroneously during the
briefing as 10 OME, the first officer could have recognized the error. Further, if the captain had correctly identified ORIGE as 5 DME and stated
this aloud, he might not have developed a mindset that led to a descent at
10 OME. The captain also failed to brief the computed flight time between
DRIGE and the missed approach point which would have been another clue to the
actual location of DRIGE. The remainder of the approach briefing was cetailed concerning
missed approach procedures and the captain’s expectations of the first
officer during the approach. The captain’s remarks, “See anything you don’t
like or anything you question, just feel free to call it&quot; is an indication
that he understood CRM concepts and solicited participation by the first
officer. These renarks were prudent, and his followup comment &quot;I’ve been
known to screw up on a regular basis,&quot; although self-deprecating, was
probably facetious and meant to put the first officer at ease so that he
would be more willing to speak up if he believed that something was amiss. The decision by the captain to fly a teardrop course reversal was
in accordance with FAA/Jeppesen guidelines. However, according tc MarkAir
management personnel, it was not in accordarce with MarkAir procedures.

29

Since the captain and other MarkAir pilots dispute the position of management
on this issue, the Safety Board was unable to determine exactly what type of
entry method MarkAir expected their pilots to use. Although unverified by
the captain, the Safety Board believes that he chose a teardrop seversal in
order to save time.</div>

highest obstruction,&quot; the Board believes that the intent of
the recommendations has been satisfied. 2.0 ANALYSIS
2.1 General

The certification, maintenance, and airworthiness of the airplane
were not factors in this accident. All airplane systems pertinent to the
accident sequence appeared to be operating normally. The Safety Board could
not positively determine the inflight accuracy of the DME equipment onboard
N670MA because of crash damage. However, comments on the CVR, information
from the FOR, the location of the wreckage, and pilot statements revealed
that this navigaticn equipment was functioning normally. Two radios were
found tuned to frequencies offset from those associated with the instrument
approach flown, but the Safety Board does not believe that this configuration
is evidence of malfunctioning equipment. Tuning knobs on radios can be
displaced during impact sequences and emergency evacuations of cockpits. In general, the pilots were certified aad examined according to
current government and company regulations and had received adequate
training to accomplish this fiight. This investigation and the recent FAA
NASIP inspection reveated nothing unusual about the B-737 pilot training
program at MarkAir. The captain and first officer were well-rested for the mo‘nirg
flight to Unalakleet. The Safety Board was unable to establish a
relationship between the somewhat stressful life events that the crewmembers
were experiencing and the accident sequence. Both pilots asserted that these
life stressors were not distracting. The general complexity of the instrument approach was not a factor
in this accident. Nonprecision approaches can be characterized as somewhat
more challenging than precision approaches. However, the LOC Rwy 14 approach
should not have been difficult to fly because no rapid descents were
required, no large runway offsets were involved, and the weather was above
approach minimums. The analysis of this accident focused on the following areas:
0 The approach briefing given by the captain.
1) The deviation by the captain from standard FAR procedure

turn procedures by descending below 3,090 feet prior to
intercepting the final approach course inbound.

28

The deviation by the captain from standard FAR instrument
procedures by descending below 1,500 feet prior to 5 UME. The fact that the first officer did not notice, question
and/or correct any of the abcve items.

2.2 Conduct of Approach and Descent Below Altitude Limitations

Approximately 15 minutes before reaching the initial approach fix
(DRIGE outbound), the captain briefed the first officer on the procedure to
be used for the localizer 14 approach. It is apparent fron cockpit
conversation that both pilots had the proper approach plates available and
that the captain was referring to the approach plate during the briefing. I[t
is reasonable to presume that the first officer was also looking at his plate
during the captain&#x27;s briefing. Althougn the captain’s briefing was detailed

The captain descended below the required level-off altitude of
1,500 feet prior to the final approach fix, contrary to
directions on the approach plate and established requirements.

the first officer did not notice, or if he did notice, did not
make the captain aware of, the two aforementioned departures
from depicted approach procedures. The GPWS on the airplane did not give a warning because the
airplane was configured to land, and no ILS glideslope
information was available.

if the airplane had been equipped with a modern GPWS, the
pilots could have been warned of impending terrain contact
about 13 seconds prior to impact. 3.2 Probable Cause

The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the
probable cause of this accident was deficiencies in flightcrew coordination,
their failure to adequately prepare for and properly execute the UNK LOC Rwy
14 nonprecision approach and their subsequent premature descent.

4.0 RECOMKENDATIONS

As a result of this investigation, the National Transportation Safety
Board made the following recommendations:

--to the Federal Aviation Administration:

In conjunction with the Flight Information Advisory Comnittee,
and in coordination with Jeppesen Sanderson, Inc., arrive at a
Standard depiction of reference circles or distance rings on
instrument approach charts. The depictions should include
common radii or the notation of the radii on the approach chart
and common centering points for the circles. (Class II, Priority

the captain, that appropriate remedial action was needed. Under Federal Aviation
Regulations, being unsure of one&#x27;s position in IMC would certainly qualify as an &quot;urgency&quot;
condition, constituting an emergency and requiring timely action. Although the airplane&#x27;s
configuration at the accident site suggests that a missed approach or a climb to a
minimum safe altitude (if the flighterew knew that they were not on the localizer course)
may have been in progress at the time of impact, either on the flighterew&#x27;s initiative or at
the controller&#x27;s suggestion, this action was delayed until it was too late to avoid ground
impact.

The Safety Board believes that there are several human performance, as well
as operational factors, which coutd help to explain how such errors may have been
compounded and not detected by the pilots in sufficient time to execute a missed
approach, These factors include training to &quot;proficiency&quot; in minimum time, the
assignment of a new captain to fly with a new first officer, the limited experience of the
first officer in multiengine airplanes and in instrument flying, the effects of a &quot;noisy&quot;
cockpit (as reflected in the flight logs and as reported to her husband and roomate)
documented dissatisfaction on the part of the first officer in communicating, the lack of
an interphone system, the effect the proximity of the passengers to the cockpit had on
crew communication, Henson&#x27;s policy of providing en route and approach charts to the
captain only, and several significant stress producing events in the lives of both pilots. SA AEST QUES SAANPRORN EA EDR RMON NI OR OIA EET ER LTTE Me

The facts illustrate that this flighterew were not sufficiently prepared to
conduct safe instrument flight operations and that the management and oversight of this
commuter airline was inadequate. The Safety Board believes that the shortcomings cn the
parts of Henson management and the FAA are among the underiying reasons for this
accident.

2.9 Operntional and Humen Ferformance Elements

2.9.1 Flighterew Experience and Qualifications

The captain&#x27;s entry level experience was 27 hours below the minimum total
time desired by Henson (2,500 hours) at the time he was hired. His multiengine time was

~-58 hours below the desired time (500 hours), and his actual instrument time was at the

minimum desired time of 75 hours.</div>

MOL when the airplane was approximately abeam the STAUT NDB, it is possible that the
flighterew accepted the abeam indication on the ADF display as passage of the outer
marker, even though the needle would have remained on the left and moved very slowly
aft. At this time, they would have lowered their landing gear, turned on the landing
lights, and begun a descent to the localizer approach minimum descent altitude (MDA) of
1,620 feet. Although the absence of any glideslope indications should have alerted them
to a problem, the reported weather conditions at SHD were well s&gt;ove the localizer-only
landing criteria. Consequently, g.ideslope information would not have been important or
needed to complete the approach and landing. However, since the weather in the
mountains east of SHD probably was worse than the weather reported at SHD, they may
have begun to execute a missed approach after arrival at MDA. In view of the fact that
the airplane crashed with the gear and flaps up, which is the missed approach
configuration, the accident eculd have oceurred during the first moments of this missed
approach attempt. The crew would have had about 1 minute 44 seconds from the time
they acknowledged that they were not. in radar contact until the controller suggested a
missed approach to lower the gear, descend from 2,700 to 1,620 feet, then raise the flaps
and gear, and climb back to 2,400 feet.

Regardiess of what occurred after the flight intercepted the MOL 045° radial,
the flighterew did not detect their sitvation in sufficient time to take the appropriate
action. This factor, as well az the other information regarding the conduct of the
approach, suggests inadequate instrument flying techniques and procedures on the parts of
both pilots, including a failure of the captain to adequately monitor the approach. If the first officer was navigating off the MOL VOR, it is difficult to
understand why the captain did not detect such a gross error. Furthermore, the
considerable time which had elapsed from the initiation of the procedure vurn without

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] In addition to the first officer&#x27;s performance problems in controllirg the
airplane during the approaches and go arounds, there was evidence from the CVR
recording of less than rigorous adherence to standard operating procedures by both
the captain and the first officer. This behavior was considered as possibly indicating
that fatigue had adversely affected their performance. Specifically, the crew briefing recorded in the descent to 11,000 feet did
not contain the prescribed information but was simply a declarative statement of the
ILS runway 7 approach assigned by the controller. Also, the captain failed to
announce the 1,000-foot warming prior to the assigned altitude of 4,000 feet. The
crew discontinued the approach at or near the final approach fix. Therefore, the need
to make standard approach callouts did not arise. Later, after they initiated the first
go around and received vectors to return for a second approach at an altitude of 2,300
feet, the crew did not complete the approach check. Additionally, during a 4-minvte
and 37-second period while the flight was retuming to commence its second
approach, the altitude alert sounded five times. Presumably, the crew set the altitude
alert at 2,500 feet, the published missed approach altitude, but tailed to reset it to the

51

assigned altitude of 2,300 feet. This placed the airplane at the normal tolerance for
the alert warning (+/- 200 feet) and resulted in the repeated wamings. If the crew had
set the altitude alert to the missed approach altitude after passing the final approach
fix during the first approach, the device would not have sounded. Additionally, on
their second approach, after the flight passed the final approach fix, the captain, as
the nonflying pilot, did not announce, “1,000 feet, instruments crosscheck,” as they
reached 1,000 feet above airport elevation; and the first officer, as the flying pilot, did
not announce the decision height to which he intended to descend. Finally, both the
captain and first officer failed to announce “positive rate&quot; prior to gear retraction, as
the nonflying pilots in their respective go arounds. The Safety Board recognizes that fatigue can result in degraded
performance in flightcrews. It also acknowledges that the disrupt:d work/rest cycle
of this flightcrew could have resulted in their being fatigued to some degree at the
time of the accident. However, it is unable to conclude that the cited deviations from
standard operating procedures are primarily attributable to flightcrew fatigue. The
Board notes that early in the first approach, the captain increasingly assumed an
instructional role with the first officer and provided on-going commentary on his

conduct of the approach. Although this instructor-student form of interaction did not
warrant their deviation from company standard procedures, it nevertheless could have
contributed to it, and provides a plausible explanation for some of the deviations. In summary, the Safety Board acknowledges that conditions were
conducive to producing fatigue in the pilots and increasing susceptibility to
disorientation.</div>

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] Because of these discrepancies and the current state-of-the-art
interpretation of instrument impact markings, the Safety Board was unable to
determine which pitch witness marks occurred at initial ground impact and which
marks were made during secondary impact(s). Therefore, the Safety Board cannot
positively determine whether the captain&#x27;s ADI was malfunctioning and was a causal
element in this accident sequence. Nor can the Safety Board rule out the possibility
that the ADI malfunctioned and precipitated the loss of control by the captain.

2.10 The Recovery Attempt

There is little doubt that there was accurate attitude information
available to the crew, at least from the standby artificial horizon. The display half of
the standby artificial horizon displayed an attitude corresponding to that of impact. Further, it is believed that the first officer&#x27;s ADI was accurate because of his recovery
efforts. His response to the captain&#x27;s release of control was not only immediate (0.7

36

seconds), but it was correct in general execution. The flightpath study indicates that
at the time control of the airplane was transferred, the bank angle had increased to
about 65 degrees, and the flightpath angle was about -15 degrees. The altitude at the
time was about 3,100 feet. The Safety Board&#x27;s research indicates that the descent
angle continued to steepen. Within 4 seconds of the first officer stating, I got it,” the
angle of the bank stabilized at about 80 degrees, the altitude was about 2,600 feet and
the flightpath angle was about -28 degrees. The first officer correctly concentrated
on trying to level the wings for the next 3 seconds. Then, as the bank angle
approached 20 degrees, he began focusing on arresting the descent. Eventually, in
the 12 seconds after he acknowledged assuming control, he recovered the airplane to
the 15 degrees left bank, and the -17 degrees flightpath present at the time of impact. There are several points to be emphasized in evaluating the recovery
attempt. Airline pilots are not periodically trained to recover from unusual attitudes
as are military pilots or civilian acrobatic pilots. The presumption is that an airline
pilot should avoid an unusual attitude and will never have a need to recover from one. Similarly, transport-category aircraft operations contrast with the military and civilian
acrobatic method of flying an airplane. Airline pilots may subconsciously avoid
abrupt maneuvers in the interest of passenger comfort. In this regard, the first officer
had no military and little, if any, acrobatic flight training. Although the captain was a
retired Naval Aviator, he last flew a military airplane in 1979, about 13 years prior to
the accident. There was no indication recorded on the CVR that the captain was
physically involved in the recovery maneuver at all. Once he relinquished control, he
did not even &quot;coach&quot; anymore, until 2 seconds before impact when he joined the
flight engineer in saying, “Up, up....&quot;

The first officer took control of the airplane at approximately 0325:50.</div>

disorientation. The accident circumstances certainly reflect substandard human
performance; however, the available evidence is not sufficient to warrant a
conclusion that crew fatigue adversely affected pilot performance in this accident,
although the Safety Board cannot rule out that possibility. Additionally, there are
other factors that could have contributed to the loss of control that either outweigh or
complement fatigue as a factor in the accident.

2.9 Loss of Control

According to the FDR, the captain began a slow, sustained left tum
(about 0.6 degrees of heading per second and about 5 degrees of bank) about
0324:50. This action was contrary to the published missed approach instructions but
possibly in anticipation of a downwind turn instruction identical to the one given by
the controller on the previous missed approach. Beginning about 0325:00, the sound
of a power reduction is ford on the CVR, and the airplane was approaching its

52

assigned altitude. However, at 0325:10, the FDR still showed the airplane ascending
through 2,800 feet at a rate of about 2,400 feet per minute. At 0325:31, the FDR
showed that the airplane&#x27;s altitude peaked out at 211 feet above the assigned altitude
of 3,000 feet. It is probable that the captain then realized he had overshot his
assigned altitude and proceeded to push the nose over during the decelerating tum to
regain 3,000 feet. About 5 seconds later, shortly after the first officer acknowledged the
tum to 300 degrees, the FDR shows that the tum rate increased dramatically. Simulations show that the bank angle then steepened to about 25 degrees when the
captain uttered the “What&#x27;s the matter&quot; comments. The flightpath study indicates that
8 seconds after exceeding 30 degrees bank angle, the airplane was passing through
about 60 degrees left bank at a 14 degree descent angle. This obvious loss of control, in context with the CVR comments,
prompted the Safety Board to examine the role played in the loss of control by: 1)
transfer of control; 2) spatial disorientation; and 3) the attitude references.

2.9.1 Transfer of Control

There was a positive transfer of control as the second ILS approach was
aborted, when the captain stated, &quot;Oh # I got it.&quot; While the first officer never
acknowledged the release verbally, there were positive affirmations in his response to
the captain&#x27;s commands for flaps and gear. The first officer also began all radio calls
as the nonflying pilot. However, there was no subsequent positive verbal transfer of
control to the first officer prior to the loss of contro) during the second go-around.</div>

did not adequately monitor the descent rate. The airplane was still descending at 1,500 fpm, 
which was far in excess of the UPS stabilized approach criteria, which required no more than 
1,000 fpm below 1,000 ft agl. The NTSB concludes that the flight crew did not monitor the 
descent rate and continued to fly the airplane with a vertical descent rate of 1,500 fpm below 
1,000 ft agl, which was contrary to SOPs, resulting in an unstabilized approach that should have 
necessitated a go-around. The flight crew should have continued to monitor the airplane’s altitude but did not; 
neither crewmember noticed that the airplane was nearing or had reached the minimums altitude 
and the first officer did not make the subsequent required altitude callouts of “approaching 
minimums” (1,300 ft msl) and “minimums” (1,200 ft msl). These callouts should have elicited 
either a “landing/continuing” (if the airport was in sight) or “go-around, thrust, flaps” (if the 
airport was not in sight) response from the captain and would have further alerted the crew to 
their proximity to the ground. Because the flight crew was flying a nonprecision approach in 
instrument conditions, extra vigilance was required to ensure that the airplane did not descend 
below the minimums altitude without the airport being in sight. The NTSB considered whether, once the profile path did not capture, the captain may 
have been attempting to use vertical speed to reintercept the glidepath from above or was using a 
vertical speed “dive-and-drive” approach. Because he did not brief the first officer on his 
intentions, the captain’s exact intentions could not be determined. Although the captain may not 
have intended to fly a “dive-and-drive” approach, the approach essentially became a 
“dive-and-drive” approach based on his actions: (1) there was no indication of a glideslope for 
him to descend to because the VDI never moved from its full-up scale indication; (2) he did not 
maintain a constant vertical speed descent as depicted on the approach chart;98 and (3) the 
captain selected a vertical descent of 1,500 fpm, which is the maximum vertical speed guidance 
outlined in the AOM for a vertical speed method consistent with “dive and drive.” 
 
98 The approach chart indicated that the rate of descent was 813 fpm to conduct a CDFA. NTSB 
Aircraft Accident Report 
65 
The captain’s belief that the airplane was “way high” on the approach and/or fatigue 
(see section 2.4.1) likely contributed to his failure to adequately monitor the airplane’s descent 
rate and altitude. The time compression resulting from the excessive descent rate, the first 
officer’s diverted attention, and/or fatigue (see section 2.4.2) likely impeded the first officer’s

conversation about the localizer 18 approach option to the runway and their concern that ATC 
had left them high on the approach. Although this conversation involved operational issues, it 
focused on past activities and would have been a distraction to the flight crew’s focus on the 
present and future actions necessary to successfully complete the remainder of the flight. The 
cues associated with the flight crew’s failure to verify the flight plan would have been especially 
salient as the airplane aligned with the localizer, and the flight crew’s discussion came at an 
inopportune time. The NTSB concludes that the captain, as PF, should have called for the first 
officer’s verification of the flight plan in the FMC, and the first officer, as PM, should have 
verified the flight plan in the FMC; their conversation regarding nonpertinent operational issues 
distracted them from recognizing that the FMC was not resequenced even though several salient 
cues were available. 
2.3.2 Vertical Deviation and Continuation of the Approach 
2.3.2.1 Failure to Capture the Glidepath 
At 0443:24, the approach controller cleared the flight for the approach stating, “maintain 
two thousand five hundred till established on localizer, cleared localizer one eight approach.” 
The airplane was 11 mi from the BASKN FAF at this time. According to radar and CVR data, 
the airplane became established on the localizer when it descended through 3,800 ft and, 
consistent with the minimum altitude for that segment of the approach, could have descended to

the FAF minimum crossing altitude of 2,300 ft when inside of COLIG. However, the captain did 
not do so, and he maintained 2,500 ft. The UPS A300 AOM and PTG recommended descending to the FAF crossing altitude 
before intercepting the profile glidepath on nonprecision approaches because intercepting the 
profile glidepath outside the FAF did not guarantee step-down fix compliance for those fixes that 
occur before the FAF. Although the flight crew repeatedly commented about being high on the 
approach, they did not discuss descending to 2,300 ft after they became established on the 
localizer between COLIG and BASKN. Additionally, it is important to note that, at this stage in 
the approach and well before the FAF of BASKN, the airplane was only 200 ft above the 
minimum altitude, which could have been corrected with minimal effort.</div>

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] The airplane crossed IMTOY very close to 
this altitude, at which point it intersected the proper glidepath; however, the captain did not 
decrease the rate of descent, and the airplane passed through the glidepath descending at 
1,500 fpm. Further, the captain did not arrest the rate of descent as the airplane approached and 
then descended through the minimum descent altitude of 1,200 ft, even though he had commented 
that “DA [decision altitude] is twelve hundred” only about 11 seconds earlier, when the airplane 
was descending through 1,470 ft. The captain’s failure to decrease the rate of descent at IMTOY 
and to completely arrest it at the minimum descent altitude is inconsistent with his evident 
awareness of the minimum crossing altitude at IMTOY (1,380 ft) and the decision altitude 
(1,200 ft). Thus, if the captain indeed planned to conduct a “dive and drive” approach after 
BASKN, he did not do so properly once he reached IMTOY. It is also possible that both pilots misinterpreted the VDI indication even though it should 
have been very familiar to them since it was identical to an ILS glideslope indication. The 
captain’s comment at 0446:53.7 that “we’re like way high … or higher” directly contradicted the 
information that would have been displayed on the VDI unless he was misinterpreting it. Similarly, the first officer’s response (“about … a couple hundred feet … yeah”) confirmed the 
captain’s statement but was also inconsistent with the VDI display.116 Nonetheless, if the pilots 
knew that they were 200 ft above the desired glidepath at BASKN and then observed the VDI 
pegged at the top of the scale, they may have associated that indication with the airplane being 
above the desired path, even though the opposite was true. Once this misinterpretation was made, 
the persistent full-scale deflection of the VDI could have convinced both pilots that the airplane 
was quite high throughout the descent from BASKN. Such confusion could explain why the 
captain maintained a very large rate of descent (1,500 fpm) for such a long time (he may have 
been expecting to see the VDI diamond move as he descended to intercept the glidepath from 
above) and why he stated “we’re like way high...or higher” at 04:46:53.7. The “or higher” part of 
this phrase suggests that the captain was not sure exactly how high the airplane was, only that the 
airplane was very high, as would be the case if he were reversing the meaning of the full-scale 
deflection of the VDI. As described above, the VDI was displaying meaningless information because the flight 
crew did not verify that the flight plan was sequenced in the FMC.</div>

tion, the pilote althar failed to move this lever past the detent or
inedvertently placed it in the closed position. On the other hand, it ie difficult to aacept the possibility
that two qualified pilots, in attempting to feather a propeller during
a period of more than a minute aftar tha decision had been made, could
both have committed euch a fundamental error as to place the high-pressure fuel valve lever in the wrong poaition and allow that error to go
unrecognized, in the absenca of any avidence other than the fact that
nothing untoward was detected during tha examination and testing of the
featheving syatem components, the Board cannot conclude that pilot wisplacement of the high-pressure fuel valve lever was the probable cause
of the failure of the propeller to feather, Rathor, we conclude that
the probable cauea thereof cannot be determined. Ie la apparent thet tha descant of the aircraft, subsequent to
the fires signs of the cruise pitch Loak problem, did not conform to
the altitude restriczions set forth in the approach procedure, For
example, the aircraft levelled off initially at 1,750 feet, or 350
below the minimum clearance altitude, Furthermore, the FDR indicates
that the alrcrait passed over the /emile fix at an altitude of approximately 900 fest, which ie 1,200 feat below the prescribed minfmum alti-~
tude for that point in the approach, The Board therefore carefully cone
sidered the posaible reasons for tha nonconformity to the approach
altitude restrictions,

There is no avidence of an altimeter error of sufficient magnitude te account for the deviation from the prescribed altitudes, ‘The
barometric settings of the two altimeters were within several hundreds
of an inch of the figure given ‘o the flight by the approach controller. Correlation of the FDR and the CVR showed that the altitude trace was
indicating about 1,300 feet at the time the firet officer said &quot;We&#x27;re

trace is about 100 to 150 feet too low, but nevertheleas quite close
to the recorder tolerance of minus 100 feat at sea level,

specific missed approach criteria, the fact remains that the glideslope indications
available to flight 1746 would have shown that the airvlane was well below glideslope. Therefore, specific missed approach criteria would not have been necessary to inform the
flighterew that they needed to execute a second missed approach. Consequently, the
Safety Board concludes that the flighterew did not perform a basic instrument flight
procedure, that of an adequate instrument sean, to ensure that all flight performance
parameters were within allowable tolerances. The evidence suggests that because the flighterew&#x27;s instrument sean was
improper, they were prone to continue an inadvertent descent below decision height. Because the crew had viewed aspects of the runway lights before executing a missed
approach, they probably believed, and the captain&#x27;s statements suggest that he assumed,
that a second attempt at landing would prove successful. Thus, it is possible that both
crewmembers, when approaching decision height, were preoccupied while attempting to
see the runway lights and approach lights and thus failed to maintain a proper scan of the
airplane instruments. Since the captain saw the runway lights on the first approach, he
may have believed that if he Increased his efforts to look for the lights, he could position
the airplane to land successfully on the second attempt. If the first officer had been
looking outside the covkpit in an effort to locate the runway, then he could not have made
the required altitude callouts. Although the evidence allowed the Board to rule out several possible causes of
the accident and to suggest several reasons for the flighterew&#x27;s actions, the fact remeins
that the Board was unable, due to the absence of an FDR or a CVR, to determine why the

flighterew did not execute a missed approach as required and instead continued the

continued its descent beyond decision height and into the terrain for undetermined
reasons,

2.4 FAA Surveillance

The Safety Board examined closely the nature of the FAA surveillance of
Simmons to determine its effect on the airline&#x27;s operations, and its possible effect on the
accident. The principal operations inspector (POI) was located in Chicago and the
principal maintenance (PMI) and avionics (PAI) inspectors in Grand Rapids. A large part
of Simmonst maintenance wes performed in Grand Rapids, the alrline corporate
headquarters were in Chicago, and its operations were based in Marquette. The Safety Board believes that the FAA surveillance of Simmons was
consistent during the period of Simmons! rani? expansion. The POI nad been associatea
with Simmons since 1983 and had been PO: since May 1985. She had witnessed the large
growth of the company in that time and had observed the changes in quality of the
operation that may have occurred. The Board believes, based on the record of
surveillance and her statements, that the POI was aware of the changes in the Simmons
operations during that time and attempted to monitor closely the possible adverse
consequences of growth and pilot turnover on those operations.</div>

failure to ask for or obtain more weather information from ATC or the Simmons station
manager, led the captain to decide to attempt a second approach into Alpsna when the
airport was below minimums for that approach. The Safrty Board believes that, regardless of the extent to which pilots had
been given unsolicited updates to Alpena&#x27;s weather, &amp; prudent eaptain would not have
assumed that the weather had not changed in an approximate 30-minute period, since the
first report was received, or the approximate 60-minute period since the weather
obse: vation had been performed, particularly since the report available indicated that
visibility was at minimum conditions. If the first officer had not obtained a weather
update on his own initiative, then the captain should have asked him to do so. The request
would not have been difficult to make since Simmons required its pilots to wear headsets
and use associated interphones that facilitated communications between crewmembers. Further, the captain stated that there was no difficulty in communication within the
cockpit. The Safety Board concludes that the Simmons procedures for flying precision
instrument approach procedures, although in compliance with applicable FAA regulations,
should have been more specific with regard to defining stabized and unstabilized
approaches and providing guidance on when to execute 4 missed approach. Had the
procedures been more specific, the flighterew might have received the additional
information needed to recognize that they were excessively below the glideslope and that
a missed approach was reqttired. Some carriers, for example, require a missed approach if
the localizer or glideslope is deflected by more than 1 dot on the ILS display. With proper
erew coordination, the nonflying pilot would call out specific deviations in the flightpath
to alert the flying pilot to execute the missed approach. The Safety Board believes that Simmons should provide such specific
information in its operations manual so that pilots can execute missed approaches
according to predefined localizer and glideslope deviations. Nevertheless, irrespective of
specific missed approach criteria, the fact remains that the glideslope indications
available to flight 1746 would have shown that the airvlane was well below glideslope. Therefore, specific missed approach criteria would not have been necessary to inform the
flighterew that they needed to execute a second missed approach.

conditions measured in the 2050 weather observation at Alpena could guickly deteriorate
and Alpena would then be below minimums. In addition, the captain may not have
realized that the first officer&#x27;s inexperience limited his ability to participate fully in the
captain&#x27;s decisionmaking process. Unfortunately, the Safety Board cannot state with eertainty the flightcrew
actions that took place at the time of the accident. Without a cockpit voice recorder and
a flight data recorder, the Board was unable to learn precisely what the flighterew said,
what callouts they made, what procedures they followed before the accident, and the
precise flightpath of the airplane. Consequently, the Board can onty assess the possible
flighterew actions that could have contributed to the continued descent below the
decision height, based on the limited information available.

2.3.9 Flightcrew Conduct of the Flight

Several factors in the operation of Might 1746 indicate that the flightcrew&#x27;s
conduct of the flight was improper. For example, the esptain&#x27;s reliance on the first
officer&#x27;s approach chart during both approaches violated the intent of company procedures
and showed 4 disregard for safe operating practices. His deseription of his reliance on the
first officer&#x27;s aporoach chart during the approach as manifesting &quot;crew coordination&quot;
shows both a lack of appreciation of the importance of the ready availability of the chart
to the proper execution of the approach as well as 4 fundamental misunderstanding of
crew coordination and its application to flight operations. The captain, as pilot-in-command, had the responsibility to bring about and
maintain effective crew coordination throughout the flight. That the aircraft continued
to descend below the glideslope and through decision height suggests, even without benefit
of a cockpit voice recorder, that proper crew coordination was nut followed. The Board
has addressed the importance of crew coordination, defined as &quot;the effective utitization
of flighterew members and other resources to enhance crew interaction, communication
and decision-making in muiti-crew aireraft operations” in other accidents involving
carriers operating under 14 CFR 135 as well as under 14 CFR 121. As a result of its investigation of an accident in Rockland, Maine, in 1979, 11/
the Safety Board on May 27, i¥80, Issued the following recommendation (A-80-42) to the
FAA:

~34-

Require that 14 CFR 135 operators emphasize crew coordination
during recurrent training, especially when pilots are qualified for
both single-pilot/autopilot and two-pilot operations. These
requirements should be outlined in an operator&#x27;s approved training
eurriculum,

On August 31, 1981, the FAA issued a change to handbook 8430,1B, Inspection
and Surveillance Procedures—Air Taxi Operators/Commuter Air Carriers and Commercial
Operators, that alerted operation inspectors to ensure that operator&#x27;s training programs
include, for operations with more than one pilot, provisions for emphasizing crew
coordination procedures in all phases of flight.

never reached MDA or 100 feet above MDA, which would further explain why
these calloute were naver mide. Additionally, the captain may have failed
to detect tia discrepancy between the p:escribed and actual aititudes be«
cause of his preoccupation with the checklist and with looking outside

the cockpit,

It should be emphasized that the possible explanation discussed imnediately above is based not only on evidence that is tenuous, at beat, but
aleo on the inferences to be drawn from such evidenc. as to what thought
processes were evolving in the mlnds of the flightcrew. Obviously, such
an explanation is, to a considerable degree, speculative in nature. It
is nevertheless the intent of the Board that, by including this discussion
in the report, pilots will be alerted against the possibility of lapsing
into such a pattern when utilizing a QFE altimeter setting procedure. We
also hasten to add that, even if it is assuned that the sequence of events
described in the above discussion in fact occurred, this should be taken
to reflect adversely not on Eastern&#x27;s system, but rather on the flightcrew&#x27;s implementation of that system in this instance, By vixtue of
training, experience, cockpit instrumentation, navigational aids, and approach plates, this crew was well equipped to accomplish the approach to
Charlotte safely, and there is no causal factor beyond the flightcrew it~
self which would account for their failure to do so. This accident exenplifies the absolute necessity of strict adherence to prescribed procedures, particularly those pertaining to altitude awareness, during an
instrument approach,

Survivability
Three major factors made this a partially survivable accident:

{{. The occupiable area of the cabir. was compromised when
the fuselage broke up,

2, The intense postimpact fire consumed the occuplable area of
the tail section and the entire center section of the cabin,

3, The occupant restraint systam failed in many instances,

the approach, It is possible that the crew, beceuse of the extended dura~
tion of flight in VMC &gt;ove a low, patchy fog bank through which intermittent ground contact way possible, may have relaxed their instrument scan
and relied more heavily upon visval cues to fly the approach, Such a possibility is consistent, not only with the discussion of Carowinds Tower
described above, but also with the captain&#x27;s remark, shortly before in
pact, that &quot;All we got to do is find the airport,&quot; and the firet officor&#x27;e
response of “Yean.&quot;’ Ultimately, when the aircraft penetrated the densa
fog around the eccident site, visual reference would hava been lost and a
switch to instrument flight would not have been possible within the availeable tima, Tha mount likely explarction of why Flight 212 was unable to
establish visual contact with tha runway environrent, whereas other
flights were able to do so and thereby complete the approach, is that
Flight 212, flying at a lower altitude, initially entered the fog bank at
a point farther from the runway threshold and thus had a greater slante
range distance through shich to sight the runway markings through the fog. Another possible reason for the crew&#x27;s lack of altitude awareness
involves the interrelationship between QNH (above sea level) and QFE
(above field elevation) altitudes during the approach.

The extraneous conversacion conducted by the flightcrew
during the descent was symptomatic of a lax atmosphere in
the cockpit which continued throughout the approach. The terrain warning alert sounded at 1,000 feet above the
ground but was not heeded by the flightcrew,

The aircraft descended through the final approach fix altitude of 1,800 feet more than 2 miles before the final approach fix was reached at an airspeed of 186 knots. The aircraft passed over the final approach fix at an altitude of 1,350 feat (or 450 feet below the prescribed crossing altitude) and at an airspeed of 168 knots, as compared
to the Veer speed of 122 knots,

Required callouts were not mide at the final aoproach fix,
at an altitude of 500 feet above field elevation, ov at 100
feet above the minimum des. ent altitude,

A severe postimpact fire occurred immediately after the
initial impact.

burns, (b) Probable Cause

The National Transportation Safaty Board determi ies that the probable cause of the accident was the flighcarew&#x27;s Lack of altitude awareness at critical points during the approach due to poor cockpit discipline
in that the craw did not follow prescribed procedures,

On October 8, 1974, tha Board fasued two safety recommendations to
the PAA (A-74-85 and A-74-8) to initiate ways and means to improve professional standards among pilots. hese recommendations cited five previous air carrier approach accidents as examles of a cael acceptance
of the flight environment, and added that the Charlotte ciush &quot;reflects
once again serious lapses in expected professional conduct.&quot; The PAA
agrees with both recommendations and is in the process of establishing a
working lfaison on this subjact with beth airline management ad air
carrier pilot organizations,

to the azimuth display might have limited the
atcention that he could devote to elevation observation. This situation combined with the
increased rate of descent of the aircraft during
the last 8 to 10 seconds of flight, could have

contributed significantly to the delay ia transmission of altitude informacion. The controllec’s
cali, placing the aircraft et minimum altitude
and too low to complete a safe approach, was
not broadcast in sufficient time to aiert the pilot
to his dangerously low position, Additionally,
the sound of the rain removal equipmen: might
have interfered with the tlightcrew&#x27;s ceception
of the controiler&#x27;s calls. Thus, under the circumstances the warning effects associated with the
controller’s minimum altitude call were negated
and the firsc officer&#x27;s impression chat everything
was “OK” until they hit is quite understandable. Another factor which compounded the erew’s
problems during the final descent was thar the
tain removal system was not operating at total
capacity in removing the water from the windshield. The reduction in capacity was due to low
engine r.p.m. during the last 22 secends of
flight. Thus, the accumulation of raindrops, with
associated problems of refraction or distortion
and possidle depressed horizon, limited the
crew’s efforts to see the runway during the most
critical portion of the approach. Subsequent to
the level-off, the crew probably expected to
break c--¢ or to obtain visual contact with the
runway .ghts momentarily. The power reduction, the position in the rain shower and short
approach light system could have contributed to
a delay in their obtaining visual contact during
which time they got into an unperceived high
rate of descent from which there was ito
recovery. The Board considered the possibility that erroneous barometric altitude information misled
the crew during passage through the rain shower
on final approach. Information concerning pressure and wind changes that occur in chunderstorms in the middie western portion of the
United States was reviewed in an effort to associate the changes with those that existed at Naha
at the time of the accident. However, there is
nothing in the FDR trace to suggest that conditions similar to those observed in midwestern
thunderstotms existed in the rain shower.</div>

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS AND CONCLUSIONS &gt; ANALYSIS] One possible explanation for the lack
of those calls is that the flight was in visual
conditions at both times, and consequently, the
pilots may not have regarded the calls necessary. Another explanation could be the lack of explicit written company directives as to crew
duties when the first officer is flying the aircraft
on an instrument approach. Also, there was an
evident lack of a clear understanding between
the pilots as to what the DH should be. The first
ofticer determined correctly that the DH was
300 feet (314 feet m.s.Lj as his radio altimeter
bug was found set at 300 feet; he had leveled the
aircraft at about 325 ausd. for a period of 7
seconds; and the altitude reminder dial was
found set at 310 feet. The captain apparently
had a minimum altitude of 200 feet in mind. His
radio and pressure altimeter bugs were found set
at 200 feet, and he was certified (under certain
circumstances not existing in this case) as qualified for the lower minima. Assuming that the
captain intended to make the “100 feet above
minimums” call, a normally accepted procedure,
he could not have been expected to make the
call since the aircraft did not reach the 100-foot
point (314 feet m.s..) above his 200 feet minimuins until the aicraft departed the lovel-off
altitude of 325 feet. During the reinitiated
descent, his attention probably was devoted to
locating the runway. The correlation of the CVR and FDR information showed that the aircraft started the
descent approximately 1/2-mile before it
reached the poine where the published glidepath

intercepted the 1,000-foot level and that it remained consistently below the glidepath until
the level-off at about 325 feet. This condition
prevailed even though the aircraft was reported
by the GCA final controller to be on the plicdepath. The Board examined the precision approach radar unit for various defects which
could have existed ana could cause the aircrafs
to appear to be positianed differently on the
glidepath from the one observed by the controller. ‘The results of this examination were
inconclusive as to the type of defect that could
have caused a below-glidepath condition, since
any such defect would show up on the radarscone and alert the controiler to a problem with
the equipment. Additionally, taining procedures include alerting the controler to any abnormal radarscope presentation. The Board recognizes that under certain conditions water drops have an etfect on the radarscope presentatioa in heavy concentrativns of
water. Under these conditions the radar controller may have difficulty in observing the target presentation. However, in the case of Flight
45, the final controller stated chat he observed

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] Additionally, this maneuver was verified by witnesses. However, the airplane struck the
ground before the descent could be stopped. Consequently, the Safety Board concludes
that once the airplane encountered an unexpected heavy rainstorm and downdrafts while
less than 100 feet above the runway, insufficient time was available for the captain to
react and the airplane to respond to avoid impact with the ground. Another factor which might have affected the captain&#x27;s perception of the
airplane&#x27;s altitude in relation to the runway was the refraction of light through the water
on the windshield. The effect of a heavy film of water on the windshield is to cause a
downward refraction of the pilot&#x27;s line of sight to the runway. The FDR trace indicated
that the airplane went below the glidepath after the captain transitioned to visual cues. This could have been the result of the approach and runway lights appearing to be higher
than their actual elevation. Consequently, it is possible that the captain was misled as to
the actual altitude of the airplane and that he thought he was higher, which resulted in his
allowing the airplane to descend below the glidepath. Moreover, he was using the VASI as
a visual reference and the limitations of the VASI would not have permitted immediate
recognition of either the descent below the glidepath or the increasing descent rate. The captain said that when he noted the position of the airplane below the
glide slope by reference to the ILS display, he added power to level the airplane and
regain the centerline of the glidepath. About the same time, the first officer made a call
concerning the position of the airplane below the glide slope, followed by a call about the
rate of descent. The captain sta.ed that he dia not hear the calls of the first officer,
even though they were clearly-noted on the CYR. However, since he was already aware of
the position of the airplane and was concentra :i: on putting the airplane back on the
glide slope, it is not likely that the calls, even if ..ard, would have stimulated the captain
to take more aggressive action.

2.4 Adherence to Checklist Procedures

Eastern Air Lines procedures required that the pilot flying the airplane make
specific altitude calls and that the nonflying pilot and the flight engineer monitor the
altitude calls to further assure that proper altitude awareness is maintained in the
cockpit. In this accident, the captain made the first altitude call of &quot;2,000 feet” at
1959:43. At 2000:03, the captain stated &quot;Eighteen hundred&#x27;s our...—yep&quot; The required
call was the final approach fix (FAF) at 1,785 feet. It appears likely that the captain&#x27;s
altitude call at 2000:03 was the glide slope intercept altitude, while the first officer&#x27;s
cali, at 2000:21, &quot;glide slope cap both sides&quot; was the actual crossing of the FAF. Although
the captain, under Eastern Air Lines procedures, was required to make the FAF callout,
he apparently anticipated the call and was conscious of the proper altitude before the
airplane reached the FAF.</div>

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] It appears likely that the captain&#x27;s
altitude call at 2000:03 was the glide slope intercept altitude, while the first officer&#x27;s
cali, at 2000:21, &quot;glide slope cap both sides&quot; was the actual crossing of the FAF. Although
the captain, under Eastern Air Lines procedures, was required to make the FAF callout,
he apparently anticipated the call and was conscious of the proper altitude before the
airplane reached the FAF. Once the first officer noted the glide slope capture at the
PAF, and then reported the passing of the FAF to the tower at 2000:28, the checklist
requirement had been met, although it was done by the first officer rather than the
captain. According to the procedure, the captain was required to make another altitude
“ awareness call at 1,000 feet above the airport. However, st 2000:49, the terrain warning
system sounded, which indicated that the airplane was about 1,000 feet above the airport. Four seconds later, the first officer said &quot;one thousand feet.&quot; This call was followed by
the second officer&#x27;s statement of &quot;one thousand feet.&quot; This again was an altitude call by
the first officer that should have beer made by the captain. It was possible that the
captain was too busy or too engrossed in the approach to make the prescribed altitude
calls. However, it was also possible that the first officer made the calls as the airplane
arrived at the appropriate altitude either because he was waiting to reach that point or
because he wanted to relieve the captain&#x27;s workload. In either case, although the captain
did not initiate the required calls, the proper altitude checks were made. At 2001:34, the first officer called, &quot;five hundred feet, ground contect.&quot;
Shortly afterwards, the captain said he had visual contact with the flashers, the approach
lights, and the runway environment. He continued to fly the airplane with reference to
visual references, and he did not make the required call of &quot;100 feet above decision
height&quot; or &quot;decision height.&quot; Moreover, the first officer and the flight engineer did not
challenge the captain&#x27;s failure to make either of these callouts. Although the first
officer&#x27;s calls concerning the airplane&#x27;s position on the glide slope, and the rates of
descent, as well as the captain&#x27;s and the flight engineer&#x27;s statements about observing the
airplane go below the glide slope, indicate that the flightcrew did monitor the
instruments, the calls of 100 feet above DH and at DH were checklist items and should
have been observed by the flightcrew. The captain had begun to fly the airplane by visual
references before he reached 100 feet above DH; however, the meteorological conditions
were marginal, and the Safety Board believes that it would have been prudent to complete
the required checklist calls, if for no other reason, in order to establish the airplane at a
specific point and altitude in the final approach sequence. The fact that the approach was
being conducted at night was further reason for the entire checklist to be followed. The
checklist callouts were a backup to the flightcrew to confirm their observations of the
position of the airplane at times during the instrument approach, and as a result, were not
items which should have been arbitrarily discounted.</div>

that the airplane was below DH might have influenced his subsequent decisionmaking
process. Further, although the deviations from the approved checklist did not contribute
to the accident, they indicate a lack of discipline which is not professional. 3. CONCLUSIONS Findings

1. There was no evidence of preim; “t structural failure, fire, or flight
control or powerplant malfunction.

2. The flightcrew did not accomplish all checklist items which related to
altitude awareness; however, members of the flightcrew did monitor the
altitude of the airplane and the flight instruments during the final
approach. The deviations from the checklist did not contribute to the accident. The instrument approach was stable and uneventful until the airplane
passed decision height.

The general weather forecast was substantially correct; however, the ~ }}

localized weather encountered by Flight 576 while on final approach was
much worse than was reported on the Airport Terminal Information
Service. Air traffic control (ATC) personnel at the Raleigh-Durham ATC facility
Were not aware of the rapidly deteriorating weather conditions in time
to warn the flightcrew. About 1957, heavy rain moved across the airport toward the approach
Course to runway 23. The weather conditions changed rapidly after Flight 576 passed decision
height. The airplane encountered an unexpectedly heavy rain with associated
downdrafts and horizontal wind shear about 100 feet above the ground. The magnitude of the downdrafts and wind shear could not be determined
from the available information. The rainfall rate may have been as high as 7 inches per hour when
Flight 576 encountered the heavy rain. The captain observed the descent below glide Slope caused by the initial
encounter with the heavy rain and responded by adding thrust. The flighterew lost forward visibility rapidly when the airplane entered
the heavy rain. The captain was not aware of the magnitude of the downdrafts and
horizontal wind shear, with the result that he initially applied the thrist
he believed necessary to maintain the glide Slope. The rate of descent increased rapidly after the airplane encountered the
heavy rain despite the addition of thrust and the upward rotation of the
airplane by the captain. The captain had less than 6 seconds to correct the airplane&#x27;s flightpath if
he was to avoid the airplane hitting the ground. There was insufficient time for the captain to react and the airplane to
respond to prevent the airplane from striking the ground after the
encounter with the heavy rain when the airplane was less than 100 feet
above the ground.</div>

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] This indicates that the altimeter system was
operating properly. The elevation at impact was about 1,675 feet. The altimeter was set at 29.70, the last altimeter setting given to the

crew. Two reasons why the aircraft might have been below its target:
altitude of 1,800 feet are evident. First, the aircraft was entering I
ground effect as it got closer to the ground and this may have caused an
error in the pitot static system which caused the altimeter to indicate
an altitude higher than the actual aircraft altitude. Second, it is
possible that the high winds blowing over the rough terrain in the accident area may have caused a pressure change which affected the
altimeter indication. However, the crew&#x27;s evident concern about the
altitude was indicated by the captain&#x27;s order regarding the power and
the first officer&#x27;s comments about the downdraft when the aircraft .
‘went below the target altitude. Based on the evidence available, the
Safety Board concludes that there was no significant error in the altitude information presented to the pilots by their instruments. The crew&#x27;s comments regarding the altitude and the power
indicate that the first officer was not flying the aircraft at the target
altitude of 1,800 feet. The Board examined the flight data recorder
trace and found that while there was evidence of moderate turbulence,
it was probably not of sufficient magnitude to prevent the first officer
from maintaining the desired altitude. There was also no evidence that
there was any problem within the aircraft that would have prevented
the pilot from staying at 1,800 feet. Therefore, the Board concludes
that the deviation below the target altitude was probably a result of
the combination of the first officer&#x27;s flying technique and the turbulence. From the above, it is clear that this was an operational
accident and that the crew knowingly descended to approximately 1, 800
feet after being cleared for the approach. The basic questions requiring resolution are (1) why did the crew knowingly descend to
1,800 feet in an area where the terrain obstacles extended almost
up to that altitude; and (2) why did the approach clearance not include
an altitude restriction under the circumstances of this case. Our review of the record supports the conclusion that the
captain believed that when he approached the airport in a radar environment for a nonprecision approach he would not be &quot;cleared for
the approach&quot; without an altitude restriction unless he could make

~ 28 -~

an unrestricted descent to the final approach fix altitude. In attempting to determine the reasons for the captain&#x27;s belief in this regard, a
brief description of the development of the usage of radar and its impact on pilot responsibilities is required. Before the advent of radar, the pilot alone was responsible
at all times for knowing the position of his aircraft with regard to the
terrain. The pilot kept the controller informed of the aircraft&#x27;s
position and of the pilot&#x27;s intentions. Typically, during an instrument
approach, numerous radio calls were made as the pilot reported his
position, altitude, and intentions. With the advent of radar, the controller was able to observe
the aircraft in two dimensions -- range and azimuth -- and was able to
_ vector flights to arrive over geographical positions.</div>

terrain may have induced an altimeter error which
could have caused the instrument to indicate that
the aircraft was higher than its actual altitude. However, the crew&#x27;s last.comments regarding
altitude indicated that they knew they were below
1,800 feet. The altitude alerting system and the radio altimeter
aural warnings sounded at appropriate altitudes to
indicate to the pilots that the aircraft was below 1, 800
feet and that the aircraft was within 500 feet and 100
feet of the ground. These latter warnings occurred

7 seconds and 1 second, respectively, before impact. The flightcrew apparently did not have sufficient
time to avoid the accident after these warnings.

19. The approach clearance was given to the flight
without altitude restrictions because the flight

was not being handled as a radar arrival and
because the controller expected the crew to conduct the approach as it was depicted on the approach
chart. Procedures contained in FAA&#x27;s Terminal Air
Traffic Control Handbook were not clear and resulted in the classification and handling of TWA
514 as a &#x27;nonradar&#x27;&#x27; arrival. The terms &#x27;&#x27;radar
arrival&quot; and &quot;nonradar. arrival&#x27;&#x27; were not defined. In view of the available ATC facilities and services
and since the flight was receiving radar service in
the form of radar monitoring while under the jurisdiction of a radar approach control facility, the
procedure should have provided for giving altitude
restrictions in an approach clearance for an aircraft operating on an unpublished route prior to its
entering a segment of the published approach
procedure. The ATC system was deficient in that the procedures
were not clear as to the services the controllers
were to provide under the circumstances of this
flight. The flightcrew believed that the controller would
not clear them for an approach until they were clear
of all obstructions. The depiction on the profile view of the approach
charts neither indicated the position of Round Hill
intersection nor did it contain all minimum altitudes
associated with the approach procedure. This information was available on the plan view of the
approach chart. The captain noticed the minimum altitude associated
with the approach segment from Front Royal to Round
Hill but he decided that the flight could descend to
1,800 feet without regard for the 3, 400-foot minimum
altitude depicted on the chart because he was not on
that segment.

The captain of Flight 514 did not question the
controller after receiving the approach clearance,
regarding the action the flightcrew was expected
to take. Another crew that questioned a similar
clearance received further instructions and information which resulted in their accepting a radar
surveillance approach to Dulles. )

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] At the time he received the
clearance, he was about 44 nmi from Armel on the 300° radial inbound
to the station. By reference to the approach chart, he should also have
been able to identify the high obstacles between that position and the. Round Hill intersection. With that information, he should have been
able to determine that 1, 800 feet was not an adequate altitude to provide terrain clearance of 2,000 feet in this designated mountainous
area. If he did not realize that he was over a designated mountainous
area, he should have applied terrain clearance of 1,000 feet as
prescribed for nonmountainous areas. He did notice the 3,400 feet
associated with the course between Front Royal and Round Hill. That
should have suggested that he should reexamine his decision regarding the descent to 1,800 feet. If he had questioned the controller regarding the minimum altitude in the area of his aircraft, he should
have received information that would have alerted him that he could

not descend to 1,800 feet until after he passed Round Hill. The information available to the pilot, including the approach
chart, should have alerted the crew that an unrestricted descent would
be unsafe. It does appear to the Board that there was a deficiency in
the chart. This particular approach chart depicted the profile view
from the final approach fix to the airport. It did not depict the intermediate fix, Round Hill, with its associated minimum altitudes. This
information was available from the plan view of the chart, but it appears
that the crew gave their primary attention to the profile. If this was the

case, it may have led the crew to discount the other information available on the chart and to continue their descent on the assumption that
it was permissible by reason of the clearance they received. The second major question deserving consideration is the role I
of the ATC system inthis accident, specifically why TWA 514 was not
given an altitude restriction in its approach clearance. The testimony
of all FAA witnesses, including the controller, was consistent in stating
that Flight 514 was not a &quot;radar arrival;&quot;&#x27; that because of this fact the
controller was not required to implement the provisions of paragraph
1360 of the FAA Handbook 7110. 8C; and that they considered TWA 514,
after intercepting the 300° radial of Armel, as proceeding on its own
navigation and as being responsible for its own obstacle clearance. The FAA witnesses stated that Flight 514 was not a radar
arrival because it had not been vectored to the final approach course. They did not consider the vector of Flight 514 by the Washington
Center to intercept the 300° radial as being a vector to the final
approach course, even though the VOR/DME approach procedure utilizes
the 300° radial inbound from Round Hill. Particular emphasis was
made by FAA that the vector to the 300° radial occurred when the
flight was approximately 80 miles from the airport and that it was
vectored by the center on to an en route course.</div>

173
Aircraft Accident Report
10. The captain may have mistakenly believed that the airplane was closer to the airport
than its actual position; however, if the captain conducted the flight’s descent on this
basis, he did so in disregard of the DME fix definitions shown on the approach chart.
11. As a result of his confusion and preoccupation with the status of the glideslope,
failure to properly cross-check the airplane’s position and altitude with the
information on the approach chart, and continuing expectation of a visual approach,
the captain lost awareness of flight 801’s position on the instrument landing system
localizer-only approach to runway 6L at Guam International Airport and improperly
descended below the intermediate approach altitudes of 2,000 and 1,440 feet, which
was causal to the accident.
12. The first officer and flight engineer noted the ground proximity warning system
(GPWS) callouts and the first officer properly called for a missed approach, but the
captain’s failure to react properly to the GPWS minimums callout and the direct
challenge from the first officer precluded action that might have prevented the
accident.
13. The first officer and flight engineer failed to properly monitor and/or challenge the
captain’s performance, which was causal to the accident.
14. Monitored approaches decrease the workload of the flying pilot and increase flight
crew interaction, especially when experienced captains monitor and prompt first
officers during the execution of approaches.
15. The captain was fatigued, which degraded his performance and contributed to his
failure to properly execute the approach.
16. Korean Air’s training in the execution of nonprecision approaches was ineffective,
which contributed to the deficient performance of the flight crew.
17. U.S. air carrier pilots would benefit from additional training and practice in
nonprecision approaches during line operations (in daytime visual conditions in
which such a practice would not add a risk factor).
18. The Combined Center/Radar Approach Control controller’s performance was
substandard in that he failed to provide the flight crew with a position advisory when
he cleared the flight for the approach, inform the flight crew or the Agana tower
controller that he had observed a rain shower on the final approach path, and monitor
the flight after the frequency change to the tower controller.
19. Strict adherence to air traffic control procedures by the Combined Center/Radar
Approach Control controller may have prevented the accident or reduced its severity. Conclusions

Aircraft Accident Report
20. If the ARTS IIA minimum safe altitude warning system had been operating as
initially intended, a visual and aural warning would have activated about 64 seconds
before flight 801 impacted terrain, and this warning would have likely alerted the
Combined Center/Radar Approach Control controller that the airplane was
descending below the minimum safe altitude for that portion of the approach.

provide guidance to maintain the desired rate of descent. (In a precision approach, the
command bars would provide guidance to maintain the glideslope; in nonprecision
approaches, they provide guidance to maintain the desired vertical speed.) Once the
airplane had reached the altitude set in the altitude selector, the FDs and autopilot would
capture and maintain that altitude. At no time during the localizer approach would the
flight crew have armed the autopilot or FDs to capture a glideslope signal or have
referenced or attempted to track any glideslope needle indications.
2.3.2 Flight 801’s Premature Descent
The Combined Center/Radar Approach Control (CERAP) controller vectored
flight 801 to join the runway 6L localizer course between the FLAKE intersection and the
GUQQY outer marker/1.6 DME fix. Although the flight was restricted to no lower than
2,000 feet msl in that portion of the localizer-only approach procedure (until crossing the
GUQQY outer marker), flight 801 descended below 2,000 feet about 1.9 nm before
reaching the outer marker.

Aircraft Accident Report
Further, although the approach procedure specified that at least 1,440 feet msl
should be maintained after passing the GUQQY outer marker and until passing the UNZ
VOR, flight 801 descended below 1,440 feet about 2.1 DME before reaching the UNZ
VOR. (None of the indications of UNZ station passage would have been presented on the
flight crew’s instrument panels at any time before impact.)
CVR information indicated that the captain was flying the airplane on autopilot
during the approach. As flight 801 descended on the approach, the captain twice
commanded the entry of lower altitudes into the airplane’s altitude selector before the
airplane had reached the associated step-down fix. After the captain heard the first officer
call out “approaching fourteen hundred [feet]” about 0140:33, as the airplane was passing
5 DME at 2,400 feet msl,188 the captain directed the first officer to reset the altitude
selector to 1,440 feet, replacing the step-down altitude of 2,000 feet before the autopilot
had captured that altitude or reached the GUQQY outer marker/1.6 DME fix. Further,
about 0141:33, with the flight neither having leveled off at 1,440 feet msl nor reached the
UNZ VOR step-down fix, the captain instructed the first officer to set 560 feet, the MDA,
in the altitude selector. The altitude selector provides the basis for the altitude alert’s aural annunciations
and the autopilot’s altitude capture functions. The captain’s premature orders to reset the
altitude selector indicated that he had lost awareness of the airplane’s position along the
final approach course.</div>

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] Thus, the captain
may have failed to track the airplane’s position on the approach because he believed that
he would regain visual conditions, the airplane was receiving a valid glideslope signal,
and/or the airplane was closer to the airport than its actual position. Regardless of the reason for failing to track the airplane’s position, the captain
conducted the approach without properly cross-referencing the positional fixes defined by
the VOR and DME with the airplane’s altitude. Therefore, the Safety Board concludes
that, as a result of his confusion and preoccupation with the status of the glideslope, failure
to properly cross-check the airplane’s position and altitude with the information on the
approach chart, and continuing expectation of a visual approach, the captain lost
awareness of flight 801’s position on the ILS localizer-only approach to runway 6L at
Guam International Airport and improperly descended below the intermediate approach
altitudes of 2,000 and 1,440 feet, which was causal to the accident.
2.4.2 Flight Crew Monitoring of the Approach
CVR evidence indicated that the flight crew seemed confused about, and did not
react to, a series of audible ground proximity warning system (GPWS) alerts during the
final approach. The first audible GPWS callout occurred about 0141:42, with the “one
thousand [feet]” altitude call. A second GPWS callout of “five hundred [feet]” occurred
about 0142:00 (when the airplane was descending through about 1,200 feet msl), to which
the flight engineer responded in astonishment, “eh?” However, FDR data indicated that no
change in the airplane’s descent profile followed, and the CVR indicated that the flight
engineer continued to complete the landing checklist. Similarly, no flight crew discussion
followed the GPWS callout of “minimums” about 0142:14, and the first officer dismissed
a GPWS “sink rate” alert 3 seconds later by stating “sink rate okay.” About 0142:19, the
flight engineer called “two hundred [feet],” followed immediately by the first officer
saying “let’s make a missed approach.” The flight engineer immediately responded “not in
sight,” followed by the first officer repeating “not in sight missed approach.” According to
the CVR, a rapid succession of GPWS altitude callouts down to 20 feet followed, as the
flight crew attempted to execute the missed approach. 
196 Human factors research has shown that a common decision-making error, especially in high stress and
workload situations, is for people to tend to ignore evidence that does not support an initial decision. Human
“operators tend to seek (and therefore find) information that confirms the chosen hypothesis and to avoid
information or tests whose outcome could disconfirm it,” which produces an “inertia which favors the
hypothesis initially formulated.” See Wickens, C. (1992). Engineering Psychology and Human
Performance, 2nd Edition. Columbus, Ohio: Charles E.</div>

packaged, there is no evidence to indicate that it cortributed to the
cause of the accident or to the death of the passengers and crew. The Approach

The CVR readout and the interview with the first officer
established that the runway was in sight when the aircraft was about 8
nmi from the runway threshold. The runway probably remained in sight
during most of the approach. The first officer commented five times during the approach,
after the aircraft was within 7.5 nmi of the runway threshold, that he
had the runway or the runway lights in sight. There was no indication
that any of the navigational aids or the aircraft instruments were
faulty. The aircraft descended about 330 ft. below the published
miniuum glide slope intercept altitude of 2,500 ft. before the glide
slope intercept point was reached. This placed the aircreft 180 ft.
below the final approach fix altitude of 2,180 ft. These altitudes
are confirmed by a CVR comment, &quot;Two thousand&quot;, made about 1.5 seconds
before the FAF callout. The Safety Board was unable to determine the
reason for this deviation from approach procedures. At FAF passage, the 7 nmi DME fix, the first officer&#x27;s navigational receiver selector switch should have been changed from the VOR
position to the ILS pozition; however, this was not accomplished. If
the change had been made, as good practice would dictate, the first
officer could have monitor?:d the approach more efriciently and his

navigational display would have been ready for crusscheck by the captain
or crossover in case of the failure of the captain&#x27;s instruments. As the aircraft approached the glide slope, it continued
through and above it as the captain started his descent, The glide
slope was intercepted as the aircraft passed through about 1,000 ft. The airspeed during this time varied a few knots above and below 169 kn. From this point on during the approach, FDR information showed
that the aircraft flightpath was not compatible with the aircraft performance which would be expected in stable air. ‘The differences can be
attributed to externa: forces acting upon the aircraft, such as wind
cuanges or rain drag. Analysis has shown that a maximum density rain
could procuce an increase in drag forces which would equate to a -600
fpm change in descent rate; however, statements by the first officer and
the surviving passengers refute any claim that the aircraft encountered
such a heavy rain before impact. Therefore, the difference hetween
expected and recorded aircraft performance was more likely caused by the
winds. An analysis was conducted to determine the wind changes needed
to produce the recorded aircraft nerformance. The flight recorder data
as recorded and corrected for an assumed 9-knot airspeed error, as
indicated by the. first officer&#x27;s airspeed callouts, were used in the
analysis. The differences produced by the 9-knot error were not considered
to be significant in the analyzed wind.</div>

4 I altitude loss to 133 feet and to miss the trees with about 35 feet of
:. _ margin. Slower recognition time or a less positive leveloff maneuver
; would have resulted in impact with the trees. The Safety Board believes
that 2.5 seconds is marginal for the perception of the change in VASI
indications and the initiation of appropriate response by the captain. Performance analysis showed also that the aircraft could not
maincain flight without further loss of airspeed after the leveloff even
with maximum thrust if the decreasing headwind condition encountered
within 120 feet of the trees persisted. However, the Board believes it
likely that the windshear encountered by the accident aircraft as it
approached the ground was a result of the wind variation with altitude
common when in close proximity to the terrain. If so, the aircraft&#x27;s
performance would not be degraded once level rlight wes achieved. Accelerated level flight or a climb should have been achievable after
threst attainment. The Safety Board considered another factor which could have
added- to or have supported the captain&#x27;s visual indications that he need
not apply power to reach the runway cr to arrest a high rate of descent. The heavy rainstorm which was moving toward the aircraft could have
caused a shortening of the pilot&#x27;s visual segment--that distance along
the suriace visible to the pilot over the nose of the aircraft. This
can produce the illusion that the horizon is moving lower and, as a
result, is often misinterpreted as an aircraft pitch change in the nose
up direction. The natural-response by the pilot would be to Jouwer the
nose or to decrease, not increase, power. While conceding that the environmental circumstances at the
time of this accident were unfaverable, the Safety Beard must conclude
that the accident could have been avoided had the crew recognized, from
all available sources, the onset nf the high descent rate and taken
timely action. The Board is, therefore, concerned about crew procedures
relative to altitude awareness and required callouts. If the crew was
completely aware of the aircraft&#x27;s altitude, they shovld not have
accepted a glide slope intercept altitude 500 ft. lower than the pub)ished
altitude; they should not have accepted an-altitude 180 ft. lower than
that altitude prescribed for the FAF crossing; and the pilots-not-flying
should have made altitude warning callouts.</div>

The CVR tape containcd a few other unintelligible comments
that may have been altitude or warning callouts. However, if these
comments were altitude or warning callouts, it is difficult to understand
why they went unheeZeod by the captain. Perhaps even mcre important than altitude awarsnese in this
accident was awareness of increasing sink rate. Pan American procedures
required that the pilot not flying the aircraft call out sink rate when
it exceeded 800 fpm and recommended that the sink rate below 2,000 ft.
should not exceed 1,000 fpm. An analysis of the approach to Pago Pago
showed that the 3.25° glide slope would require a descent rate slightly
less than 800 fpm vith en indicated airspeed of 135 kns in zero wind
conditions. In this case, 135 kus was the reference speed (V,,¢) for
the approach. Using the company procedure of adding only helf the
steady wind velocity to Vre¢, the required descent rate would be Jess
than that rate required for zero wind since the groundspeed would be
‘ffected by the total value of the steady wind velocity. Any additional
speed margin tc compensate for wind gust velocity would have had the
effect of increasing the groundspeed and thereby increasing the required
descent rate; however, such rates would still be less than 1,000 fpm
even with a 35-knot gust margin,

The captain of Flight 806 was attempting to maintain an approach
speed of 150 kns. If the anticipated headwind dissipated to zero, the

descent rate required to maintain position on the glide slope would have
been 880 fpm, sti?1 less than the 1,000 fpm maximum. Nevertheless,
according to procedures, a callout should have heer made which may have
alerted the captain that the actual winds differed from those reported. The FPR data showed that the aircraft&#x27;s rate of descent increased
about 1,500 fpm at least 15 seconds before impact. Again, there were no
callouts and the evidence indicated that the captain did not recognize
or react te this increased sink rate in a timely manner. The Safety
Board believes that, had he done so as a result of a callout by one of
the nonflying crewmembers, the accident could have been avoided.</div>

pilot’s relatively short time flying in the local area suggests that his cognitive map of the terrain 
between Rudyerd Bay and Ketchikan may not have been as detailed or accurate compared to those 
of other pilots who had more local flying experience. Considering all these factors, it is possible 
that the accident pilot mistook the first mountain for the second one and turned the airplane west 
too early; such a mistake, in which a pilot does not recognize or maintain the desired position 
relative to the external ground and airspace environment is an example of geographic 
disorientation (Antuñano, Mohler, and Gosbee 1989). The fact that the pilot subsequently 
continued the flight straight and level at an altitude that would have been sufficient to clear terrain 
on the typical route (but was insufficient to clear the high terrain he was flying toward) further 
supports the possibility that the pilot was geographically disoriented. Thus, the NTSB concludes 
that the pilot’s continued flight in low-visibility conditions at a lower-than-normal vantage point 
in an area in which he lacked extensive flying experience reduced his ability to visually identify 
landmarks and resulted in a navigational error due to geographic disorientation. 
2.2.3 CFIT 
According to recorded flight data, the airplane’s final turn to the west occurred about 
half-standard rate; then the airplane continued on a nearly straight and level flightpath toward the 
higher terrain for about 30 seconds. In the final 2 seconds of the flight, the airplane pitched up 
rapidly, experiencing a vertical acceleration of about +2 Gs before colliding with terrain. The 
timing of the pilot’s aggressive pitch-up maneuver strongly supports the scenario that the pilot 
continued the flight into near-zero visibility conditions and, as soon as he realized that the flight 
was on a collision course with the terrain, he pulled aggressively on the elevator flight controls in 
an ineffective attempt to avoid the collision. Effective CFIT avoidance requires assessment of weather conditions and appropriate 
aeronautical decision-making in response to cues associated with deteriorating weather. The pilot 
missed opportunities to prevent the accident both in his decision to take the short route despite the 
presence of low clouds and obscured terrain, to turn toward an area of the lake where visibility 
was further reduced, and to continue the flight into deteriorating conditions rather than escape 
them.</div>

missed opportunities to prevent the accident both in his decision to take the short route despite the 
presence of low clouds and obscured terrain, to turn toward an area of the lake where visibility 
was further reduced, and to continue the flight into deteriorating conditions rather than escape 
them. Research on weather-related accidents suggests that expert and novice pilots assess weather 
differently and that some weather-related accidents may result, in part, from an inaccurate 
assessment of weather conditions (Wiggins and O’Hare 2003a). 
The FAA defines (in 14 CFR Part 1) daytime flight visibility as the average forward 
horizontal distance from the cockpit at which prominent unlighted objects may be seen and 
identified; additional FAA guidance (in FAA Order JO 7900.5D) states that, if a reference marker 
“can barely be seen and identified, the visibility is about the same as the distance to the marker.” 
However, several factors can affect the extent to which landmarks are identifiable or barely visible 
to a pilot flying in poor visibility conditions, including the pilot’s contrast sensitivity, familiarity 
with the landmarks involved, and accuracy of distance estimates to those landmarks. Contrast sensitivity declines with age, beginning about age 40 (the pilot’s age was 64); 
therefore, the accident pilot may have had less ability to identify features in reduced contrast visual 
scenes like those obscured by rain or mist. Although the accident pilot was experienced, he had

NTSB 
Aircraft Accident Report 
49 
relatively little experience flying tours around Ketchikan; thus, he likely had less finely detailed 
knowledge of the local geography. This same lack of knowledge of the fine details of the local 
geography could also have made it more difficult for him to estimate distance. Therefore, the 
pilot’s relative unfamiliarity with the landmarks on the tour route and the area weather dynamics 
may have affected his ability to accurately assess and respond to the deteriorating weather 
conditions he encountered. 
2.2.3.1 Pilot’s CFIT-Avoidance Training and Experience 
The FAA does not require CFIT-avoidance training for pilots of fixed-wing aircraft. However, since 2012, all commercial air tour operators in Southeast Alaska have been providing 
cue-based training to their pilots that was developed specifically for their operations as a result of 
NTSB Safety Recommendation A-08-61, which recommended a cue-based training program that 
“specifically addresses hazardous aspects of local weather phenomena and in-flight 
decision-making.” Such training programs are based on the premise that exposing pilots to realistic 
depictions of deteriorating in-flight weather will help calibrate their weather assessment and foster 
an ability to accurately assess and respond appropriately to cues associated with deteriorating 
weather (Wiggins and O’Hare 2003b). 
Promech’s CFIT Avoidance Manual, which was created in conjunction with the Medallion 
Foundation, outlined its training program and described the policies and procedures for company 
pilots to use for CFIT avoidance during all phases of flight. Per the manual, CFIT-avoidance 
training included ground training and cue-based training in an FAA-approved ATD.</div>

typically fly southwest over Ella Lake and proceed beyond the south end of the lake before turning 
west. This route allows the flights to avoid the high terrain located west of the lake, which includes 
two similarly shaped mountains. (See figure 16.) 
 
Figure 16. The typical flight route (white) passes two similarly shaped mountains before turning 
west. For comparison, the path flown by the accident pilot is shown in green. Although the accident pilot climbed the airplane to an altitude that would have provided 
safe terrain clearance along the typical route, he deviated from that route and turned the airplane 
west after it passed only the first of the two mountains. The pilot’s route deviation placed the 
airplane on a collision course with the 1,900-ft second mountain, which it struck at an elevation of 
about 1,600 ft msl. (See figure 17.)

Figure 17. The path flown by the accident pilot (green), viewed from the approximate altitude of 
the accident airplane, is shown turning to the west (right) after passing the first mountain. Note: A translucent mask is imposed on the image to provide a notional representation of reduced visibility weather 
conditions. The vantage point of the image distorts the flight route depiction in the foreground (where the segment of 
the route originates in the bottom center of the image); there is no steep vertical climb in the flight route at the location 
shown in the foreground. Research suggests that, when navigating, people find their way through large-scale 
environments by learning to identify key landmarks (route knowledge) and developing map-like 
internal representations (cognitive maps) of the area. When traveling, people use the landmarks to 
update their position on their internal cognitive map and decide when and where to turn 
(Golledge 2010). However, a number of factors can increase the likelihood of navigational errors. Navigational errors are more likely if landmarks are difficult to discern or if cognitive maps are 
inaccurate (Golledge 2010). Landmarks are more difficult to discern when visibility of fine detail 
is degraded or when landmarks are viewed from an unfamiliar vantage point (Cuqlock-Knopp and 
Whitaker 1993; Schreiber et al. 1998). 
Several factors were present during the accident flight that increased the likelihood that the 
pilot would make a navigational error.35 Visibility was degraded over the south end of Ella Lake; 
thus, the pilot may not have been able to clearly distinguish some of the landmarks by which he 
typically navigated. In addition, the accident pilot was flying the route at a relatively low altitude 
because of the poor weather conditions, which resulted in his viewing terrain from a 
lower-than-normal vantage point. (The accident pilot had transited the area earlier that day about 
2,000 ft msl, and other Promech pilots had flown about 2,500 to 3,000 ft msl.) Further, the accident

disorientation, which could lead to loss of control and/or a controlled flight into terrain accident. Had the pilot performed an interim risk assessment and considered the external circumstances or 
discussed them with the spotter,107 the NMSP dispatcher, or SAR ground personnel, he would 
have been more likely to recognize the potential hazards associated with an immediate takeoff 
and might have delayed his departure from the remote landing site until more favorable 
conditions prevailed. The NTSB concludes that the pilot exhibited poor decision-making when 
he chose to take off from a relatively secure landing site at night and attempt VFR flight in 
adverse weather conditions.

actors Affecting the Pilot’s Decision-Making 
This section addresses factors that could have influenced the pilot’s decision-making both 
before accepting the mission and when he took off from the mountain to return to SAF, including 
fatigue, self-induced pressure, and situational stress. The NTSB considered whether environmental and/or physiological factors related to the 
cold temperature or the high altitude might have degraded the pilot’s decision-making in this 
case. The pilot spent about 50 minutes searching for the hiker and carrying her up a steep slope 
in very cold, windy conditions, in freezing precipitation, while dressed only in an unlined 
summer-weight flight suit and undergarments. Although cold stress can degrade cognitive 
performance, especially for tasks that a
re at the U.S. Army Research Institute for Environmental Medicine indicated that, based 
on the pilot’s level of exertion and the terrain, the pilot’s metabolic rate would likely have been 
fairly high, offsetting the cold weather’s effects and minimizing the risk of hypothermia. After 
reviewing the circumstances of this accident for evidence of any physiological effects from the 
high altitude (the pilot was operating in the unpressurized helicopter for more than 2 hours 
before the accident), U.S. Army Research Institute for Environmental Medicine personnel 
indicated that the altitude would have affected the pilot very little as well. Because the pilot lived 
at an altitude of about 6,000 feet, he would likely have been sufficiently acclimatized to operate 
at higher altitudes.109 Since the time at altitude was relatively short (about 3 hours), there was 
likely little hypoxic effect on the pilot’s cognitive function. 
 
107 The SAR commander spoke with the spotter while the pilot was retrieving the hiker and urged the spotter to 
remain in place and wait for ground teams to arrive if it was not safe to take off. However, it is not clear that the 
spotter shared this information with the pilot when he returned to the helicopter; the spotter did not recall the pilot

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] It is likely that the pilot’s nature in this regard, combined with his 
concern for the well-being of the hiker, created significant self-induced pressure for him to 
ensure that the mission was successfully completed, despite increasingly difficult conditions. In addition, the accident pilot’s relatively brief tenure (about 6 months) in the chief pilot 
position may have left him vulnerable to management pressure to accept missions. Postaccident 
interviews with NMSP aviation section pilots and management personnel indicated that the DPS 
cabinet secretary’s questioning of pilots regarding launch decisions and his evident displeasure 
when the NMSP pilots did not accept a mission when others did (such as the New Mexico 
National Guard) sent the message that he wanted NMSP aviation section pilots to accept SAR 
missions, without adequate regard for the potential risks involved.

 gonna spend a lot of time or we’re going to have two search and rescues,” and, “Just tell her 
to start blowing her [expletive] whistle and I’ll try to find her, okay?” These statements and the 
pilot’s use of profanity (which was absent during earlier communications with the dispatcher)

suggest that the pilot was experiencing increased situational stress as a result of the perceived 
challenge posed by the deteriorating conditions. Cognitive effects of stress can include

pressures that contributed to a reduction in the safety of flight operations conducted by the 
NMSP 
ating the weather conditions, the 
approaching darkness, and the potential for pilot fatigue, he may have elected to bring a second 
ait until morning to search for the hiker. At the very least, a 
ent process would likely have prompted the pilot to mitigate 
potenti
ing of attention, response rigidity, longer reaction time to peripheral stimuli, and 
increased errors.119 It is possible, therefore, that the “tunnel vision” created by acute situational 
stress caused the pilot to fixate on the goal of taking off from the remote landing site as soon as 
possible and to disregard mounting evidence that it was not safe to take off after he returned with 
the hiker. 
2.3.4 Summary of Factors Affecting the Pilot’s Decision-Ma
The NTSB concludes that the pilot decided to take off from the remote landing site, 
despite mounting evidence indicating that the deteriorating weather made an immediate return to 
SAF inadvisable, because his fatigue, self-induced pressure to complete the mission, and 
situational stress distracted him from identifying and evaluating alternative courses of action. 
2.4 Organizational Issues 
A number of organizational and management issues, including NMSP aviation section 
staffing, pilot flight and duty time and rest period limitations, and SMS programs and policies, 
were identified in this accident investigation.</div>

possibilities would r
rrain. While it appears that the pilot reported to the dispatcher that he hit the mountainside 
shortly after the erratic flying began, without knowing the exact point of impact, it is unclear 
whether the erratic flying led to the impact or if the erratic flying occurred because of the impact. As a result, it was not possible to evaluate the relative likelihood of these two possible causal 
explanations. The remainder of this analysis discusses safety issues related to the following: the pilot’s 
decision-making, flight and duty times and rest periods, NMSP staffing, SMS programs and risk 
assessments, communications between the NMSP pilots and volunteer SAR organization 
personnel, instrument flying, and flight-following equipment.

completed his normal 8-hour work shift) regarding use of the NMSP helicopter to aid in SAR

recordings, the pilot was initially reluctant to launch on the accident mission because he believed 
it was too windy; the pilot stated that he would prefer to go up to look for the hiker in the 
morning. The pilot’s concern about the windy conditions likely stemmed from a flight he 
operated with the full-time helicopter pilot a few hours earlier when the two pilots encountered 
winds gusting to near 40 knots on the ground in Las Vegas, New Mexico,102 and adjusted their 
return flight to SAF. However, minutes after the request to fly the accident mission, the pilot 
called the dispatcher back and told her that he had “checked the wind”103 and could “probably go 
up and take a look” for the missing hiker. The full-time helicopter pilot said that the aviation section pilots normally obtained the

lack of information regarding the accident airplane‘s navigation frequency settings and flight 
instrument indications precluded National Transportation Safety Board investigators from 
determining why the pilot believed he was not receiving a valid glideslope signal. 
8. The pilot‘s workload increased substantially and unexpectedly as a result of encountering 
instrument weather conditions. 
9. The pilot‘s expectation that he could descend below the cloud ceiling at an altitude above the 
minimum descent altitude for the approach, his familiarity with Andrews Air Force Base, and 
the reduction in workload a return to visual conditions would have provided are all factors 
that may have encouraged the pilot to deviate below the glideslope and attempt to ―duck 
under‖ the cloud ceiling. NTSB 
Aircraft Accident Report 
72 
10. The pilot failed to adhere to instrument approach procedures when he did not arrest the 
helicopter‘s descent at the minimum descent altitude. 
11. Although descent rate and altitude information were readily available through cockpit 
instruments, the pilot failed to monitor the instruments likely because he was preoccupied 
with looking for the ground, which he could not identify before impact due to the lack of 
external visual cues. 
12. If the helicopter had been equipped with a terrain awareness and warning system, aural 
terrain alerts of ―Caution Terrain,‖ ―Warning Terrain,‖ and ―Pull-up,‖ would have been 
provided. These would have been more salient than the alert provided by the radar altimeter 
and likely would have caused the pilot to attempt to arrest his descent. 
13. The failure of the Potomac Consolidated Terminal Radar Approach Control controller to 
provide the current Andrews Air Force Base weather information likely led the pilot to 
expect that he could descend below the cloud ceiling and establish visual contact with the 
ground at an altitude well above the minimum descent altitude for the approach. 
14. Air traffic services provided by the Ronald Reagan Washington Airport Tower and Potomac 
Consolidated Terminal Radar Approach Control controllers to the accident flight exhibited 
numerous procedural deficiencies, including unresponsiveness, inattention, and poor radar 
vectoring. These deficiencies were a distraction to the pilot and increased his workload by 
requiring him to compensate for the poor services provided. 
15. Although the pilot met the recent-experience requirements to act as pilot-in-command under 
instrument flight rules, he was not proficient in instrument flight. This lack of proficiency 
likely contributed to the pilot‘s failure to properly conduct what effectively became a 
nonprecision approach at night in instrument conditions. 
16. Changes made by the Maryland State Police Aviation Command to its instrument training 
program about 10 months before the accident did not promote instrument proficiency.

Further, the NTSB concludes that the pilot‘s expectation that he could descend below the 
cloud ceiling at an altitude above the MDA for the approach, his familiarity with ADW, and the 
reduction in workload a return to visual conditions would have provided are all factors that may 
have encouraged the pilot to deviate below the glideslope and attempt to ―duck under‖ the cloud 
ceiling. Regardless of the pilot‘s expectations for reaching VMC, once he deviated below the 
glideslope, he should have been prepared to level off at the MDA prescribed by the instrument 
approach procedure until he was able to confirm the airport environment as required by federal 
regulations. The pilot‘s failure to stop or slow the descent indicates that he was not aware of the 
helicopter‘s excessive descent rate or its height above the terrain, likely because he was looking 
outside the cockpit for the ground. At night, with low cloud ceilings, reduced visibility, and no 
surface light references, there were insufficient visual cues available for the pilot to establish 
ground reference. The helicopter was equipped with a radar altimeter, which should have alerted the pilot 
when he descended below 300 feet agl, about 6 seconds before impact with the trees.72 However, 
there was no decrease in the helicopter‘s descent rate after it passed through 300 feet agl. Testing 
of the radar altimeter revealed no discrepancies that would have prevented it from functioning 
normally during the accident flight. The NTSB concludes that the pilot failed to adhere to 
instrument approach procedures when he did not arrest the helicopter‘s descent at the MDA. The 
NTSB further concludes that although descent rate and altitude information were readily 
available through cockpit instruments, the pilot failed to monitor the instruments likely because 
he was preoccupied with looking for the ground, which he could not identify before impact due 
to the lack of external visual cues. Additionally, NTSB investigators asked a manufacturer of TAWS to determine what pilot 
alerts would be expected if the helicopter had been equipped with TAWS. The manufacturer 
ascertained that three aural terrain alerts would have been generated at 7, 4, and 2 seconds prior 
to tree impact, and an aural glideslope alert would have been generated 24 seconds prior to tree 
impact if a valid glideslope signal was being received. It is unlikely the glideslope warning 
would have caused the pilot to arrest his descent since it appears that he intentionally deviated 
from the glideslope. However, if the helicopter had been equipped with a TAWS, the aural 
terrain alerts of ―Caution Terrain,‖ ―Warning Terrain,‖ and ―Pull-up,‖ would have been 
provided.</div>

prompted the ADW controller to provide assistance, possibly including the ASR approach. Also, 
he could have executed a missed approach and attempted the ILS approach a second time to 
determine if the glideslope failure was a perceived failure or a legitimate one. Additionally, there 
were 11 other instrument approaches at ADW, any of which he could have requested. About 27 seconds after the controller stated that she was unable to provide an ASR 
approach, upon reaching an altitude of about 1,450 feet msl on the glideslope and at a distance of 
about 4.0 miles north of the runway threshold, the helicopter‘s rate of descent increased rapidly 
from about 500 feet per minute (fpm) to greater than 2,000 fpm. The helicopter continued the 
descent, passing through the MDA for the localizer approach (407 feet agl), the alert height set 
on the radar altimeter (300 feet agl), and the decision height for the ILS approach (200 feet agl), 
before impacting trees and terrain about 3.2 miles north of the runway threshold. Data recovered 
from the PAR computer indicate that the helicopter impacted with the engines near idle power, 
the main rotor system at 100 percent rpm, and an indicated airspeed of about 92 knots. No 
evidence was found to indicate that the pilot made any attempt to arrest the helicopter‘s descent 
before impact. The sudden increase in the helicopter‘s rate of descent may indicate that the pilot 
deliberately deviated from the approach procedure by attempting to ―duck under‖ the cloud layer 
to regain visual conditions. Several factors might have encouraged the pilot to attempt to ―duck 
under‖ the cloud ceiling. First, the outdated ADW weather report provided by the PCT controller 
indicated a ceiling of 1,800 feet and 7 miles visibility. Given these conditions, the pilot would 
have had a reasonable expectation that he could have descended below the cloud ceiling at an 
altitude well above the MDA for the approach. Second, the pilot was based at ADW and familiar with its visual environment. This likely 
would have given him confidence that he would be able to identify landmarks and quickly 
determine his position once he descended below the cloud ceiling. Third, a return to visual conditions would have relieved the pilot of the additional 
workload generated by instrument flight. All medical flights involve significant workload and 
time pressure to provide patients with timely service to medical aid. However, this flight 
involved unusually high workload once the pilot encountered instrument conditions. These 
conditions greatly increased the demands on the pilot since he had little recent experience in 
actual instrument flying. Additionally, the weather prevented him from reaching the planned 
medical center, forcing him to divert with the new responsibility of considering alternate 
transport arrangements for the patients along with his diversion considerations. Workload was 
further increased by the limited support he received from ATC, which included 
unresponsiveness, inefficient clearances to ADW, and an inability to provide a requested ASR 
approach. The NTSB therefore concludes that the pilot‘s workload increased substantially and 
unexpectedly as a result of encountering instrument weather conditions.</div>

the descent progressed or became visually disoriented

were not monitoring altitude instruments. The company had ao altitude awareness procedures for
visual flight below MDA or DH. The Federal Aviation Adminstration&#x27;s surveillance of
Atlantic City Airlines was inadequate in that weight
and balance conputations were not monitored and a
formal wind shear training program did not exist. The accident was survivable in the passenger cabin. Survivability in the cockpit was marginal because
penetration by trees destroyed integrity of the left
side of the cockpit. While the use of a shoulder
harness probably would have lessened the severity of
the captain&#x27;s injuries, the availability of a shoulder

his fatal injuries. 3.2 Probable Cause

The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the
probable cause of this accident was the flightcrew&#x27;’s lack of altitude
awareness during a circling approach which permitted the aircraft&#x27;s
flightpath to deviate below a safe approach profile. The aircraft&#x27;s
rate of descent ard descent flightpath angle increased as a result of
wind shear encountered during the visual approach below minimum descent
altitude. The flightcrew did not recognize these fligintpath deviations
because they were relying on visual references which were degradeu by
nonhomogeneous fog and on kinesthetic cues which were adversely affecte?

by the aircraft&#x27;s forward center of gravity resulting from the improper, -

loaded aircraft. Contributing to the accident was the lack of company
procedures requiring altitude-callouts during the visual portion of an
instrument approach. BY THE NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD

This accident clearly demonstrates that adverse factors can,
without warning, combine and quickly place a pilet in a siruation where
his senses are unreliable and his control of the aireraft is in jeopardy. Under these circuustances, his only recourse is to rely on information
from the flight instrurnents. Since factors such as optical accommodation,
instrument interpretation, and pilot reaction time become critical at
low altitudes, the better source of instrument information is from oral
communication by the pilot who is not flying the aircraft. For this
reason, we believe that Atlantic City Airlines’ lack of altitude awareness
procedures for visual flight below MDA or DH must be considered contributory
to this accident. Additionally, we believe that the captain, knowing that
the approach was begun under decreasing visibility conditions, should
have been prepared to immediately execute a missed approach when visual
references were degraded or lost. The first officer&#x27;s injuries were typical of those associated
with forceful impact with solid nonyielding objects. The severe head
and internal injuries suggest that these injuries were caused by the trees
which penetrated the left side of the cockpit. Although shoulder harnesses
were not provided in the cockpit, the availability of such restraining
devices would not have prevented the first officer&#x27;s injuries. However,
the captain probably would have received lesser injuries, and perhaps could
have avoided the head injurfes and the internal injuries had a shoulder
harness been available and worn. The extent of the damage to the occupied seats, both in the
cabin and in the cockpit, indicates that the forces involved in the
ceceleration of the aircraft equalled or exceeded the limits to which
these seats are designed. 7/ Ye ig estimated that the mean decelerative
forces in this crash were in the range of 12 to 15 G&#x27;s. The fatal injuries sustained by the passenger seated in the
first row on the left side of the cabin are typical of bodily contact
with a solid object. While it is possible that the bulkhead in front
of this passenger was forced back far enough to make contact, there is
evidence that this passenger did not have her seatbelt fastened and was
thrown against the bulkheed, causing contre-coup and chest injuries. The fatal injuries received by the passenger seated in the second row
on the right aisle side were probably associated with the collapse of
his seat. It is possible that this passenger sustained chest injuries
when kis seat collapsed downward, causing his chest to contact the lower
edge of thea seat in front of hin.

Therefore, the analysis of the circumstances indicates that the pilots yo

were vulnerable to the combined effects of a number cf factors. Moreover,
the Safety Board believes that the combined effects probably caused the ;

Wind Shear Combined with the Aircraft&#x27;s Forward c.g. Condition-- Bi
An analysis of the weather conditions that existed in the Atlantic City Ry
area on the night of the accident shows that wind shear existed at 1 w Moa
altitudes and that the wind shear was associated with a warm front that :
moved rapidly northeastward through the area. The wind shear measurement Bf
made vy the FAA at NAFEC clearly defined two distinct layers of shear. A

Although these measurements were made about 30 mi northeast of
Cape May County Airport and were made about 37 min before ~he accident, .
the warm front sloped toward the northeast and passed across the Cape 4
May area at the surface about 2340. Therefore, the Safety Board concludes Pw
that similar wind shear conditions existed in the Cape May area when the _
accident occurred. Moreover, the wind shear probably existed at lower =
altitudes and the magnitudes of the shears probably exceeded those
treasured at NAFEC.</div>

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] In an effort
to understand why the captain of Delta flight 554 was unable to land safely, the Safety Board
analyzed the effect that his use of MV contact lenses had on his vision under those conditions. Individuals with normal binocular vision use both binocular and monocular cues
for depth perception. Although binocular vision is generally accurate to distances of up to 600
feet, binocular cues are most critical in determining the distance from objects close to an
individual, while monocular cues assume an increased role in the perception of distances from
objects farther away. The Safety Board concludes that the captain’s use of MV contact lenses
resulted in his (unrecognized) degraded depth perception, and thus increased his dependence on
monocular cues (instead of normal three-dimensional vision) to perceive distance. However,
because of the degraded conditions encountered by flight 554, the captain was not presented with
adequate monocular cues to enable him to accurately perceive the airplane’s altitude and distance
from the runway during the visual portion of the approach and landing. This resulted in the
captain’s failure (during the last 10 seconds of the approach) to either properly adjust the
airplane’s glidepath or to determine that the approach was unstable and execute a missed
approach. The unnecessary increase in descent rate 10 seconds before impact is consistent
with the captain’s degraded binocular vision, because it suggests that he had the impression that
the airplane was slightly higher than it actually was. A flying pilot with normal depth perception
might have perceived the airplane’s increasingly excessive sink rate earlier and either slowed the
rate of descent to make a normal landing possible or performed a missed approach. However,
the captain did not have normal depth perception and did not recognize that anything was wrong
with the approach until about 4 seconds before the accident, when the “aim point shifted down
into the lights.” The captain applied engine power and pitched up and the airplane’s rate of
descent began to decrease; about 2 seconds later, the airplane struck the approach lights and then
the runway deck, where the main landing gear separated from the airplane. The Safety Board concludes that because of the captain’s use of MV contact
lenses, he was unable to overcome the visual illusions resulting from the approach over water in
limited light conditions (absence of visible ground features), the irregular spacing of the runway
edge lights at shorter-than-usual intervals, the rain, and the fog, and that these illusions led the
captain to perceive that the airplane was higher than it was during the visual portion of the

60
approach, and thus, to his unnecessarily steepening the approach during the final 10 seconds
before impact. The first officer stated that during the visual portion of the descent and landing he
primarily monitored the cockpit instrumentation, provided the captain with feedback based on
that information, and glanced outside occasionally to monitor the approach visually, while the
captain flew the approach primarily using outside visual references. As stated earlier, at 1638:26,
when the first officer advised the captain “sink’s seven hundred,” the airplane was actually
descending about 1,200 feet per minute.</div>

in a pilot making an unnecessarily rapid descent and possibly descending too soon, especially
in the absence of other visual references or cues.
 
11. The captain’s use of monovision contact lenses resulted in his (unrecognized) degraded depth
perception, and thus increased his dependence on monocular cues (instead of normal threedimensional vision) to perceive distance.

12. Because of the captain’s use of monovision contact lenses, he was unable to overcome the
visual illusions resulting from the approach over water in limited light conditions (absence of
visible ground features), the irregular spacing of the runway edge lights at shorter-than-usual
intervals, the rain, and the fog, and that these illusions led the captain to perceive that the
airplane was higher than it was during the visual portion of the approach, and thus, to his
unnecessarily steepening the approach during the final 10 seconds before impact.
 
13. During the visual portion of the approach, when the captain was primarily relying on visual
cues, the first officer, who was primarily monitoring cockpit instrumentation to gauge the
airplane’s position with regard to the runway, provided input to the captain that surpassed
what was set forth in the guidance available to the pilots at that time.
 
14. The Delta manuals were not sufficiently specific regarding pilot-not-flying duties during
Category I instrument landing system approaches after the pilot flying establishes ground
contact.
 
15. Although Delta’s manuals did not adequately specify operational criteria for a stabilized
approach, the lack of guidance in this area did not contribute to the accident.
 
16. Aviation medical examiners (AMEs) need to know if pilot examinees are using contact
lenses, and currently no process is in place to ensure that AMEs are provided with that
information.
 
17. Information concerning the possible hazards of monovision contact lens use is not well
disseminated among optometrists and the pilot population.
 
18. The lag time in the display of vertical speed information in the vertical speed indicator
installed in the accident airplane limited the first officer’s ability to provide the captain with
precise vertical speed information during the critical final seconds of the approach, and
therefore contributed to the accident.
 
19. Pilots need to be aware of the type of vertical speed information provided by the vertical
speed indicator installed in their airplane, and to understand the possible ramifications of that
information.
 
20. The Federal Aviation Administration’s (FAA) current guidance on special airports contained
in Advisory Circular 121.445-1D is not sufficiently specific about criteria and procedures for
designation of special airports; therefore, the FAA’s current guidance might not always be
useful to air carriers operating in and out of (existing or potential) special airports.
 
21. The current requirements for special airport pilot qualifications might not be sufficient to
ensure that pilots who are so qualified have been exposed to the runways and/or approaches
at those airports that make the airport “special.”

power because he perceived a need to slightly increase the airplane’s rate of descent; however,
the descent rate increased beyond what the captain likely intended to command. At 1638:30, the
airplane’s descent rate was about 1,500 feet per minute. By 1638:32, the captain had recognized
that corrective action was required and was increasing the nose-up elevator deflection and
increasing the engine power.54 About 2 to 3 seconds before the initial impact, the airplane was
descending about 1,800 feet per minute; however, the trend in vertical velocity started to reverse. According to the first officer, several seconds before impact he glanced outside
and realized that the airplane was descending short of the runway, and at 1638:33.7, he stated,
“Nose up…nose up.” The first officer stated that the captain had already added power and the
nose of the airplane pitched up; however, it was too late to avoid the accident.
 
54 At 1638:32, the EPRs began to increase rapidly (from 1.10 EPRs at 1638:32, to 1.15
EPRs at 1638:33, to 1.25 EPRs at 1638:34, and to 1.55 EPRs at 1638:35).

2.2.2
The Landing
The Safety Board sought to determine why the descent rate of flight 554 continued
to increase until a safe landing could no longer be achieved. The Safety Board analyzed the
visual cues in the airport environment, including the airport lighting system and the effect of the
weather at the time of the accident, the effect of the captain’s vision limitations, and the first
officer’s actions and input to the captain during the last 10 seconds of the flight. The pilots performed the instrument approach and landing in low clouds,
moderate-to-heavy rain and fog (which obscured the VASI lights and the runway environment),
and in limited light conditions. In addition, the pilots indicated that when they descended out of
the clouds, the airplane was positioned over the waters of Flushing Bay (which appeared gray),
with no visible structures to aid in visually judging distance and/or altitude. Although the
weather conditions were sufficient for the approach to be made safely, the low overcast cloud
layer and heavy rain and fog encountered by flight 554 during its approach to runway 13
degraded visual cues that the captain might otherwise have used to gauge the airplane’s rate of
descent/descent path during the visual portion of the approach.</div>

40 It is not known to what degree camera settings or features (such as automatic exposure 
adjustments in response to changing lighting conditions) and water on the camera lens may have 
affected the accuracy of the imagery’s depiction the visibility conditions encountered. However, the 
Company 2 pilot’s decision to descend and reverse course in the areas north of Waimea Canyon and 
Lua Reservoir (some of which have a minimum altitude of 1,500 ft agl) suggest that he encountered 
significantly degraded visibility. Aviation Investigation Report

However, one pilot also thought that the accident pilot, due to his high level of 
expertise, sometimes flew closer to adverse weather than more novice or more 
conservative pilots did. This pilot said the accident pilot was a skilled veteran who 
knew what he was doing, knew his own limitations, and was “capable of getting 
through higher tolerance areas without really getting himself dangerously into them.” 
This pilot said he had seen the accident pilot “manage things that [were] pretty tight” 
and “avoid things that were riskily…tight.” 
As discussed in section 2.1, there was no evidence that any medical condition, 
fatigue, or company pressures influenced the accident pilot’s decision to continue the 
flight into reduced visibility conditions rather than divert the tour. Considering the 
absence of such influences, as well as the accident pilot’s experience level and 
reported aversion to taking weather-related risks during tours, his continuation of the 
accident flight suggests that he had difficulty assessing the weather conditions in 
flight or that he had an optimistic belief in his own ability to fly safely through areas of 
reduced visibility. Such possibilities are consistent with psychological studies of pilots’ 
weather-related decision-making (discussed in section 2.3.1 below), which found that 
an inadequate weather assessment or risk perception biases can influence pilots to 
continue flights into deteriorating weather conditions. 
2.3.1 Weather Assessment and Risk Perception Biases 
Psychologists who study expert decision-making under conditions of 
uncertainty in real-world settings have found that such decisions typically involve two 
processes: situation assessment and action selection (Klein 2008, Orasanu, Martin, 
and Davidson 2001). The quality of available information also plays a role in the 
action selection stage of expert decision-making. Decision-makers employ mental 
simulation (the formation of a mental model) to choose an appropriate response 
strategy when faced with complex, uncertain situations. The formation of an accurate 
mental model depends on accurate information (Klein 2008). 
Because there were no weather observation sources on the north side of 
Waimea Canyon that covered areas north of the canyon to the Nāpali Coast, the 
accident pilot could not have checked the conditions there before departure. While 
his flight was in Waimea Canyon and encountered deteriorating weather at the north 
end, he would have been unable to see the weather conditions north of the canyon 
until his tour exited the canyon over the west rim.</div>

Upon exiting the canyon, the accident pilot may have optimistically thought 
that any encounter with poor visibility along the high elevation canyon rim would be 
brief and that conditions would improve as the flight continued toward the Nāpali 
Coast, where he could descend the helicopter over the terrain downslope, increasing 
the flight’s clearance below the clouds. However, due to the atypical weather pattern 
on the day of the accident, such a supposition would have been incorrect because 
some of the clouds moving in from the northwest were very low, extending to the 
ground as fog in some areas as they moved over the terrain on the northwest side of 
the island. Thus, the accident pilot’s decision to continue the flight into an area of 
deteriorating weather at the north end of Waimea Canyon and then continue farther 
north of the canyon may have resulted from a lack of relevant preflight weather 
information, which hindered his ability to develop an accurate mental model of the 
atypical weather situation. Research on pilots’ weather assessments has shown that some pilots may also 
continue visual flight into adverse weather conditions due to deficiencies in situation 
assessment. That is, they do not adequately recognize when the conditions that they 
can see in front of them have deteriorated to the point that they are unsafe. One 
simulator study found that only 10 out of 32 VFR pilots made a timely decision to 
divert their flights when they encountered IMC. Further, pilots in the study varied 
substantially in their estimates of ceiling height and visibility (and tended to 
overestimate both), and those who continued the flights made less accurate (higher) 
estimate of visibility than those who diverted (Goh and Wiegmann 2001). Another 
study that presented pilots with videos of in-flight weather conditions found that their 
assessments of the conditions were inaccurate and overly optimistic (Coyne et al. 
2008). Thus, it is possible that the accident pilot’s decision to continue the VFR flight 
into deteriorating weather was influenced, in part, by an inaccurate in-flight 
assessment of the weather conditions. Another possibility is that the pilot accurately assessed the conditions but still 
chose to fly into an area of deteriorating weather, which would indicate a deficiency 
in the action selection stage of decision-making.</div>

in the action selection stage of decision-making. Risk perception can play a role in 
decision errors at the action selection stage (Goh and Wiegmann 2001). A study of 
general aviation pilots suggests that pilots may have lower levels of risk awareness 
and higher than average self-appraisals of skill and judgment in flying, suggesting the 
potential for overconfidence (O’Hare 1990). Traffic safety studies indicate that drivers 
also tend to be unrealistically optimistic when judging their driving competency and 
that this has implications for their perceptions of driving risk and willingness to

51 
engage in high-risk driving behaviors (DeJoy 1989, Mairean and Havârneanu 2018); 
the same could be true for pilots. Although the accident pilot was described by most as safety conscious and 
having good judgment when it came to weather, one pilot stated that the accident 
pilot, due to his high level of expertise, sometimes flew closer to adverse weather 
than more novice or more conservative pilots. This statement suggests that the 
accident pilot may have felt comfortable relying on his own judgment to decide 
whether an area of deteriorating weather that did not meet FAA requirements was a 
hazard to avoid. Maintaining the minimum 3-mile visibility required by the HATCPM (which is 
substantially more conservative than the minimum visibility required for standard Part 
135 helicopter flights) and Safari’s procedures would have provided the accident 
pilot ample opportunity to avoid entering hazardous weather conditions. His 
continuation of the flight into deteriorating weather north of Waimea Canyon until the 
accident occurred suggests the possibility that he may have been overconfident in his 
ability to transition safely through an area of poor visibility conditions. Safety theorists posit that work as described in written policies and procedures 
often differs from work as performed by operators (Dekker 2006). This gap between 
the prescribed procedures and the manner in which the operator actually performs 
the work is presumed to exist because workload and economic goals incentivize 
operators to routinely adapt safety-related procedures to keep systems functioning 
(Reason 1997, Rasmussen 1997). According to the theory, the magnitude of this gap 
between “work as imagined” and “work as performed” varies over time, and 
operating practices can, under some circumstances, deviate beyond safe boundaries 
through a process known as “procedural drift,” a term that reflects the insidious 
nature of the change (Johnston 2003). 
Procedural drift has been discussed in analyses of various accidents.</div>

                        <div class="chunk-text">[CONCLUSIONS &gt; FINDINGS] 3.1 Findings 
1. The investigation determined that the pilot was certificated and qualified in accordance with 
Federal regulations. 
2. Examinations of the recovered engine, propeller, and airframe components revealed no 
evidence of any preimpact failures. 
3. The weather conditions forecasted for and observed in the area on the day of the accident did 
not appear to be exceptional compared to the conditions that the pilot experienced on 
previous flights. 
4. The airplane was in a climbing left turn when it collided with terrain, and flight control 
inputs occurred shortly before terrain impact. 
5. The airplane’s radar altimeter system provided both aural and visual altitude alerts about 4 to 
6 seconds before impact, which likely prompted the pilot to take aggressive action on the 
flight controls, resulting in the airplane nose-up pitch and left-bank angles evident at the 
accident site. 
6. Had the pilot not inhibited the terrain awareness and warning system’s aural voice and 
pop-up text alerts, the system would have provided an aural and visual alert up to 30 seconds 
before the impending collision. 
7. A deliberate execution of a left turn toward the rising terrain by the accident pilot in any 
weather condition would require a lack of situational awareness that is inconsistent with the 
pilot’s reported level of proficiency, typical safety practices, and familiarity with the area. 
8. A medical condition leading to transient incapacitation or impairment could explain the 
circumstances of this accident however, it is not possible to determine whether such a 
scenario occurred. 
9. Although the pilot had some precursors for the development of fatigue, and the accident 
circumstances are consistent with fatigue impairment or a sleep event, there is insufficient 
evidence to determine whether fatigue-related performance or alertness impairments played a 
role in the accident. 
10. The accident pilot’s recent major life events placed him at an elevated risk for stress at the 
time of the accident, but it is not possible to determine how, or to what extent, this stress may 
have affected his performance. 
11. A crash-resistant flight recorder system that captures cockpit audio, images, and parametric 
data would have substantially aided investigators in determining the circumstances that led to 
this accident.

12. Had the emergency locator transmitter remained attached to its mounting tray, it would not 
have become separated from its antenna, and its signals likely would have been detected soon 
after impact; as a result, rescue personnel would have received timely notification of the 
accident and its location and could have reached the survivors hours earlier, when the 
weather and daylight were more conducive for their evacuation.

the GPS navigational aid and the pilot’s familiarity with the area and the flight route should have 
provided him sufficient references to plan for avoiding terrain if he encountered IMC or another 
problem. If the pilot were performing at his reported typical level of proficiency and needed, for 
some reason, to deviate from the airplane’s usual course to the fishing camp, he likely would 
have been aware that a turn to the right would overfly the low tundra (allowing for maneuvering 
or a safe descent, as needed), whereas a turn to the left would fly directly toward high terrain. The NTSB concludes that a deliberate execution of a left turn toward the rising terrain by the 
accident pilot in any weather condition would require a lack of situational awareness that is 
inconsistent with the pilot’s reported level of proficiency, typical safety practices, and familiarity 
with the area. As previously discussed, from the airplane’s last known position, one possible flightpath 
scenario that could place the airplane at the accident site involved only a slight amount of left 
flight control input initiated near the airplane’s last known position. Such a scenario could result 
if the pilot had become spatially disoriented and allowed an uncorrected left bank to develop. For 
example, the “leans,” one of the most common illusions that pilots experience, can occur in 
degraded visibility when a pilot inadvertently rolls the airplane into a slight bank without 
awareness of the bank and believes that the airplane is flying straight and level.86 However, the 
“leans” can occur only while a pilot neglects to scan or disbelieves the cockpit instruments that 
provide correct orientation guidance. Such inattention to flight instruments would be unlikely for 
a pilot of the accident pilot’s experience level. Regardless of the pilot’s actions or intentions, the heading of the airplane at impact 
suggests that the pilot was largely unaware that the airplane was approaching the rising terrain. This apparent lack of awareness suggests that the accident pilot’s perceptions and/or responses 
became substantially impaired at some point after the airplane’s last known Sky Connect 
position. Using the limited information available, the NTSB explored what types of impairment 
could have led the pilot to allow the airplane to turn unnoticed toward the higher terrain before 
the final 4 to 6 seconds of the flight when he applied aggressive flight control inputs. The pilot

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] According to the 
airplane impact study that considered the topography near the accident site and the radar 
altimeter system’s selected 275-foot agl DH, the estimated elapsed time from the activation of 
the radar altimeter’s annunciator light and aural tone to the time of impact was about 4 to 
6 seconds. The NTSB concludes that the airplane’s radar altimeter system provided both aural 
and visual altitude alerts about 4 to 6 seconds before impact, which likely prompted the pilot to 
take aggressive action on the flight controls, resulting in the airplane nose-up pitch and left-bank

the TAWS’s aural voice and pop-up text alerts, the system would have provided an aural and 
visual alert up to 30 seconds before the impending collision. Examination of the GNS 530 GPS unit revealed that, when tested, the unit’s map display 
was consistent with the area of the accident site, indicating that the unit was on at the time of the

no effect on the GPS unit’s TAWS terrain page depictions). However, the GNS 530 GPS unit’s 
limited memory does not store user page display settings; therefore, it is not known if the 
accident pilot may have used the GPS unit’s TAWS terrain page or navigation map during the 
accident flight. A simulation using the airplane’s GNS 530 GPS showed that, had the pilot used the GPS 
unit’s TAWS terrain page, nearly all of the terrain near the accident site would have been 
depicted in either red or yellow. Testing of the GPS unit showed that, had the pilot used only the 
navigation map page (not the terrain page), the navigation map would have displayed “MUKLG” 
on the map, indicating the location near the Muklung River (visual landmark) within the wide 
pass near Muklung Hills relative to the airplane’s position. Examination of all the user-defined 
waypoints programmed into the GPS found none that, if navigated toward from the airplane’s 
last known position, would have led the pilot to the accident site vicinity. With or without the GNS 530 GPS unit’s TAWS terrain page in use, the availability of 
the GPS navigational aid and the pilot’s familiarity with the area and the flight route should have

these risk factors were present for the pilot during the last minute of the accident flight. Attempts to continue visual flight into IMC may be even more problematic for
helicopter pilots than for pilots of fixed-wing aircraft because helicopters are inherently
less stable and require near continuous control inputs from the pilot. Helicopters, like the
accident helicopter, that are not equipped for IFR flight and do not have control
stabilization or autopilot systems can impose high perceptual and motor demands on the
pilot. These helicopters can make it very challenging for pilots to maintain stable flight by
referring to flight instruments alone. When the accident pilot attempted to continue visual
flight into IMC, he would have been subjected to a high workload in order to maintain
control of the helicopter. Moreover, the extent of the weather echoes and the duration of
the sustained turn captured by the radar track suggest that the encounter with IMC was Analysis

prolonged. This would have further complicated the pilot’s workload and increased the
potential for spatial disorientation resulting from hazardous illusions, thereby, increasing
the potential for inappropriate control input responses. In the absence of evidence indicating a mechanical malfunction, severe
turbulence,89 or some other factor that would explain the accident pilot’s apparent loss of
control of the helicopter, spatial disorientation is the most likely explanation. The Safety
Board concludes that the helicopter’s descending spiral flightpath, which became
increasingly erratic in the final seconds of the flight, was consistent with pilot spatial
disorientation.
2.3.2 Pilot’s Decision-making
Although the pilot likely encountered areas of deteriorating weather and IMC near
the accident site, photographs recovered from a passenger’s camera showed areas of
clearer weather along the coastline, east of the helicopter’s position, as it exited Waialeale
Crater. The lower terrain between the helicopter and the coastline and the height of the
clouds would have permitted a safe deviation in that direction. Furthermore, Bali Hai
pilots were authorized to fly as low as 1,000 feet agl from the crater toward the coast; thus,
the pilot could have flown in the direction of better weather, while remaining in
compliance with SFAR 71 and the certificate of waiver or authorization requirements. Rather than deviate to the east, however, the pilot chose to fly south, along his usual tour
route adjacent to Kahili Ridge, as the advancing line of clouds closed in on the high
terrain. The pilot’s decision to fly into an area of deteriorating weather and high terrain,
despite the availability of a safer route to the east, was an error that played an important
causal role in this accident, and the Safety Board considered many factors that may have
influenced that decision.
2.3.2.1 Inexperience with Local Weather Patterns
The accident pilot had been flying commercial air tours for Bali Hai on Kauai for
less than 2 months. Nearly all of his previous flight experience had been gained as a
military pilot with the Indian Air Force.</div>

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] Nearly all of his previous flight experience had been gained as a
military pilot with the Indian Air Force. Though the pilot was experienced in helicopter
operations and claimed previous mountain and coastal flying experience, he had few flight
hours as a commercial air tour pilot and had limited knowledge of Kauai’s weather
patterns. The pilot had no previous experience flying in Hawaii before he was hired by
Bali Hai, and he began conducting tour flights after accruing just 6.7 hours of flight
training from company personnel, none of which included specific training on Kauai
weather. Many experienced local air tour pilots interviewed after the accident stated that
VFR helicopter operations on Kauai were unusually challenging because of the rugged
terrain, mountain winds, and rapidly changing visibility and cloud conditions. They stated
89 The forecast included only moderate turbulence, and the weather study found no evidence to indicate
a likelihood of severe turbulence. Analysis
39
Aircraft Accident Report
that these conditions rendered traditional sources of pilot weather information, such as
automated reporting stations and FSS briefings, not very useful, and that this heightened
the importance of a pilot’s skill in visually assessing changes in weather conditions during
tour flights. The experienced pilots indicated that a pilot’s skill in assessing changing
weather conditions and anticipating the effect of any changes on flying conditions was
critical for effective decision-making. They stated that such skills improved as local flying
experience increased. This raises concern about the impact of local inexperience on the
safety of pilot decision-making. A review of the eight weather-related air tour accidents
that have occurred in Hawaii since SFAR 71’s implementation revealed that four of the
accidents involved pilots who had relatively low experience flying air tours in Hawaii. In
fact, three of the accidents involved pilots who had flown there for less than 2 months. It is highly unlikely that the accident pilot would have decided to continue into the
area of deteriorating weather conditions and attempted to cross in the vicinity of the
accident site if he had accurately assessed the changing weather and had appreciated how
it would likely affect flight visibility in those areas. Therefore, the pilot’s decision to fly in
the vicinity of the accident site indicates that he was unable to accurately assess how
rapidly or to what extent the weather was deteriorating in that area. As described earlier in
this report, the pilot had previously told a passenger that he had flown through thin clouds
during a ridge crossing because he could see through the clouds. The pilot may have
expected that this would be the case during the accident flight; however, visibility was
dramatically reduced along the top of the ridge as the incoming line of weather reached
the high terrain. The Safety Board concludes that the pilot’s inexperience with Hawaii weather
conditions affected his ability to make appropriate in-flight decisions when faced with
deteriorating weather.</div>

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] Moderate turbulence was forecast, and passengers from
previous tours reported that the helicopter encountered some turbulence, rain, and high
winds. Weather radar data indicated that a line of weather echoes containing rain showers
was converging on the ridge near the accident location about the time of the accident. This line of echoes was associated with a lowering of cloud bases below 2,400 feet
msl and obscuration of the higher terrain in the area where the accident occurred. ATC
radar data indicate that the helicopter passed over terrain elevations as high as 3,000 feet;
thus, the pilot likely encountered areas of restricted visibility as he attempted to cross the
ridge. Analysis
37
Aircraft Accident Report
ATC radar data was of limited use in helping investigators understand the
helicopter’s movements because the helicopter’s mode C transponder was not functioning
properly and transmitted erroneous altitude data; damage precluded postaccident testing
of the unit. As a result, the available data provided only a two-dimensional ground track
for the flight. The data showed that, as the helicopter crossed the top of the ridge, it
entered a clockwise, spiral pattern for the remaining 47 seconds of flight. This spiral track
grew increasingly erratic before ending near the location of the aircraft wreckage, which
suggests that the pilot was unable to maintain a stable heading. Without accurate altitude
data, however, it is impossible to know what changes in altitude may have accompanied
these changes in ground track. The accident site was on a 75º slope, and the wreckage debris was scattered up the
slope. Observed wreckage damage included fragmented skids and cross tubes, heavier
crush damage on the right side of the cabin than the left, downward deformation of the tail
boom, and evidence of a high engine-power setting. These damage characteristics and the
wreckage debris distribution suggest that, when the helicopter struck the sloping terrain, it
was in an extreme nose-high attitude with a high engine-power setting, neither of which
are consistent with what would be expected for controlled cruise or maneuvering flight. Although it is possible that the pilot may have seen the terrain through the clouds
moments before impact and added control inputs in an attempt to avoid it, the erratic,
zigzagging ground track that preceded the impact suggests that the pilot lost control of the
helicopter before the collision.
2.3
Human Performance
2.3.1 Spatial Disorientation
Spatial disorientation has contributed to many accidents involving loss of control. In these cases, loss of control follows the pilot’s inappropriate control resulting from
confusion about the aircraft’s attitude. Major situational risk factors for spatial
disorientation include sustained turns, high workload, false surface planes created by
sloping clouds or terrain, and transitions between VMC and IMC that require shifting
visual attention between external visual references and cockpit flight instruments. All of
these risk factors were present for the pilot during the last minute of the accident flight. Attempts to continue visual flight into IMC may be even more problematic for
helicopter pilots than for pilots of fixed-wing aircraft because helicopters are inherently
less stable and require near continuous control inputs from the pilot.</div>

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] Both pilots’ attitudes and inattention during
subsequent operations demonstrated a lack of regard/respect for their responsibilities and
duties. Despite the pilots’ unprofessional verbal behavior throughout much of the flight,
CVR, FDR, ATC, and radar information indicated that they were generally attentive to
required flight-related duties until shortly before the accident. For example, the pilots
were very attentive to the weather conditions (low ceilings and reduced visibility) at IRK,
checking and rechecking the IRK ASOS observations as they approached the airport. Additionally, the captain provided a thorough landing briefing in which he stated the
MDA and runway TDZE (1,320 and 964 feet, respectively) and reviewed the missed
approach procedures. He also restated the MDA as he began the approach. However, despite their apparent awareness of proper approach procedures and
altitudes, the pilots continued their 1,200 fpm descent below the MDA without an
appropriate visual reference. The captain should have leveled off and focused on the flight
instruments and the first officer should have instructed him to level off. It was apparent
that they did not have the requisite visual cues needed to descend further at that time. Instead, about 2 seconds after the airplane descended through the MDA, still descending
about 1,200 fpm, the captain asked the first officer, “what do you think?” About 4 seconds
later, the first officer responded, “I can’t see [expletive].”
Corporate Airlines’ procedures dictated that the first officer was to monitor the
approach and report deviations from standard company approach procedures. During the
accident approach, the first officer occasionally provided the captain with appropriate
nonflying/monitoring pilot support (such as when he prompted the approach checklist,
provided DME callouts, repeated the MDA altitude, and prompted landing flaps).
However, there were several instances in which the first officer failed to provide
company-required callouts or provided nonstandard callouts. For example, he was
required to callout “100 feet above minimums” and “minimums,” as the airplane
descended through those altitudes, but instead he made a single callout of “thirteen
twenty” as the airplane approached the MDA. Most significantly, the first officer did not
challenge the captain’s failure to level off at or reduce the airplane’s rate of descent around
the MDA, despite the fact that the first officer did not see any ground references and was
responsible for monitoring the progress of the approach.110
110 The Safety Board notes that careful adherence to standard procedures and division of responsibility
in the cockpit can significantly help pilots limit the degrading effects of fatigue. The role of fatigue in this
accident is discussed in section 2.5. Analysis

Aircraft Accident Report
The first officer appeared to be engaged in appropriate nonflying/monitoring pilot
activities during the later stages of the approach; he was looking for external visual
references and stated, “in sight, continue” when he eventually observed the approach
lights (about 11 seconds after the airplane descended through the MDA). He also
prompted the captain regarding the landing flap configuration late in the approach.</div>

Findings
1.
The captain and first officer were properly certificated and qualified in accordance
with, and had received the training and rest time prescribed by, Federal regulations
and company requirements. The flight crewmembers possessed valid and current
medical certificates appropriate for 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121 flight
operations.
2.
The accident airplane was properly certificated and maintained and was equipped and
dispatched in accordance with applicable regulations and industry practices. There
was no evidence of any preexisting powerplant, system, or structural failure.
3.
The accident airplane’s cargo and its loading were not factors in the accident.
4.
Although the weather did not cause this accident, the low ceiling and reduced
visibility at Kirksville Regional Airport made the nonprecision approach more
challenging.
5.
Corporate Airlines’ policies, procedures, and training were consistent with industry
standards.
6.
 Air traffic control was not a factor in the accident.
7.
The emergency response did not adversely affect the survivability of this accident.
8.
An enhanced ground proximity warning system (required by Federal regulation since
March 29, 2005), would have provided the pilots with a “too low terrain” alert in
sufficient time to avoid collision with the trees.
9.
Although the accident airplane’s 1,200 feet per minute (fpm) rate of descent was
consistent with company procedure, it varied from current Federal Aviation
Administration guidance that recommends a descent rate of no more than 1,000 fpm
below 1,000 feet above ground level.
10. The pilots failed to follow established procedures to effectively monitor the airplane’s
descent rate and height above terrain during the later stages of the approach and relied
too much on minimal external visual cues. Although descent rate and altitude
information were readily available through cockpit instruments, both pilots were
largely preoccupied with looking for the approach lights. Conclusions
57
Aircraft Accident Report
11. The pilots’ nonessential conversation below 10,000 feet mean sea level was contrary
to established sterile cockpit regulations and reflected a demeanor and cockpit
environment that fostered deviation from established standard procedures, crew
resource management disciplines, division of duties, and professionalism, reducing
the margin of safety well below acceptable limits during the accident approach and
likely contributing to the pilots’ degraded performance.
12. Compliance with sterile cockpit rules may have resulted in an increased focus on
standard procedures and professionalism during the accident flight.
13. The captain should have, but did not, arrest the airplane’s rapid descent when they
reached the minimum descent altitude (MDA), and the first officer should have, but
did not, challenge the captain’s descent below the MDA.
14. The use of a constant-angle-of-descent approach technique, with its resultant
stabilized, moderate rate-of-descent flightpath, and obstacle clearance, would have
better positioned the accident airplane for a successful approach and landing.
15. Current regulations permitting pilots to descend below the minimum descent altitude
(MDA) into a region where obstacle clearance is not assured may result in reduced
margins of safety for nonprecision approaches, especially in conditions of low
ceilings, reduced visibility, and/or at night.</div>

                        <div class="chunk-text">[CONCLUSIONS] Current regulations permitting pilots to descend below the minimum descent altitude
(MDA) into a region where obstacle clearance is not assured may result in reduced
margins of safety for nonprecision approaches, especially in conditions of low
ceilings, reduced visibility, and/or at night. Further, these regulations can have the
unintended effect of encouraging some pilots to descend below the MDA in an
attempt to acquire visual cues that will permit them to continue the approach, as
occurred in this case.
16. On the basis of the less than optimal overnight rest time available, the early reporting
time for duty, the length of the duty day, the number of flight legs, the demanding
conditions (nonprecision instrument approaches flown manually in conditions of low
ceilings and reduced visibilities) encountered during the long duty day (and the two
previous days), it is likely that fatigue contributed to the pilots’ degraded performance
and decisionmaking.
17. Existing Federal Aviation Administration pilot duty regulations do not reflect recent
research on pilot fatigue and sleep issues, increasing the possibility that pilots will fly
in a fatigued condition.
18. Providing pilots with additional fatigue-related training, such as that being developed
by the Department of Transportation Operator Fatigue Management Program, may
increase their awareness and use of fatigue avoidance techniques and thus improve
safety margins.
19. Capturing the maximum recorded data possible is necessary for a more effective
reconstruction of the events that lead to accidents and the issuance of more timely
safety recommendations to prevent similar accidents from recurring. Conclusions

Aircraft Accident Report 3.2
Probable Cause
The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of
the accident was the pilots’ failure to follow established procedures and properly conduct
a nonprecision instrument approach at night in instrument meteorological conditions,
including their descent below the minimum descent altitude (MDA) before required visual
cues were available (which continued unmoderated until the airplane struck the trees) and
their failure to adhere to the established division of duties between the flying and
nonflying (monitoring) pilot. Contributing to the accident were the pilots’ failure to make standard callouts and
the current Federal Aviation Regulations that allow pilots to descend below the MDA into
a region in which safe obstacle clearance is not assured based upon seeing only the airport
approach lights. The pilots’ failure to establish and maintain a professional demeanor
during the flight and their fatigue likely contributed to their degraded performance.

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] In addition to the first officer&#x27;s performance problems in controllirg the
airplane during the approaches and go arounds, there was evidence from the CVR
recording of less than rigorous adherence to standard operating procedures by both
the captain and the first officer. This behavior was considered as possibly indicating
that fatigue had adversely affected their performance. Specifically, the crew briefing recorded in the descent to 11,000 feet did
not contain the prescribed information but was simply a declarative statement of the
ILS runway 7 approach assigned by the controller. Also, the captain failed to
announce the 1,000-foot warming prior to the assigned altitude of 4,000 feet. The
crew discontinued the approach at or near the final approach fix. Therefore, the need
to make standard approach callouts did not arise. Later, after they initiated the first
go around and received vectors to return for a second approach at an altitude of 2,300
feet, the crew did not complete the approach check. Additionally, during a 4-minvte
and 37-second period while the flight was retuming to commence its second
approach, the altitude alert sounded five times. Presumably, the crew set the altitude
alert at 2,500 feet, the published missed approach altitude, but tailed to reset it to the

51

assigned altitude of 2,300 feet. This placed the airplane at the normal tolerance for
the alert warning (+/- 200 feet) and resulted in the repeated wamings. If the crew had
set the altitude alert to the missed approach altitude after passing the final approach
fix during the first approach, the device would not have sounded. Additionally, on
their second approach, after the flight passed the final approach fix, the captain, as
the nonflying pilot, did not announce, “1,000 feet, instruments crosscheck,” as they
reached 1,000 feet above airport elevation; and the first officer, as the flying pilot, did
not announce the decision height to which he intended to descend. Finally, both the
captain and first officer failed to announce “positive rate&quot; prior to gear retraction, as
the nonflying pilots in their respective go arounds. The Safety Board recognizes that fatigue can result in degraded
performance in flightcrews. It also acknowledges that the disrupt:d work/rest cycle
of this flightcrew could have resulted in their being fatigued to some degree at the
time of the accident. However, it is unable to conclude that the cited deviations from
standard operating procedures are primarily attributable to flightcrew fatigue. The
Board notes that early in the first approach, the captain increasingly assumed an
instructional role with the first officer and provided on-going commentary on his

conduct of the approach. Although this instructor-student form of interaction did not
warrant their deviation from company standard procedures, it nevertheless could have
contributed to it, and provides a plausible explanation for some of the deviations. In summary, the Safety Board acknowledges that conditions were
conducive to producing fatigue in the pilots and increasing susceptibility to
disorientation.</div>

conducive to producing fatigue in the pilots and increasing susceptibility to
disorientation. The accident circumstances certainly reflect substandard human
performance; however, the available evidence is not sufficient to warrant a
conclusion that crew fatigue adversely affected pilot performance in this accident,
although the Safety Board cannot rule out that possibility. Additionally, there are
other factors that could have contributed to the loss of control that either outweigh or
complement fatigue as a factor in the accident.

2.9 Loss of Control

According to the FDR, the captain began a slow, sustained left tum
(about 0.6 degrees of heading per second and about 5 degrees of bank) about
0324:50. This action was contrary to the published missed approach instructions but
possibly in anticipation of a downwind turn instruction identical to the one given by
the controller on the previous missed approach. Beginning about 0325:00, the sound
of a power reduction is ford on the CVR, and the airplane was approaching its

52

assigned altitude. However, at 0325:10, the FDR still showed the airplane ascending
through 2,800 feet at a rate of about 2,400 feet per minute. At 0325:31, the FDR
showed that the airplane&#x27;s altitude peaked out at 211 feet above the assigned altitude
of 3,000 feet. It is probable that the captain then realized he had overshot his
assigned altitude and proceeded to push the nose over during the decelerating tum to
regain 3,000 feet. About 5 seconds later, shortly after the first officer acknowledged the
tum to 300 degrees, the FDR shows that the tum rate increased dramatically. Simulations show that the bank angle then steepened to about 25 degrees when the
captain uttered the “What&#x27;s the matter&quot; comments. The flightpath study indicates that
8 seconds after exceeding 30 degrees bank angle, the airplane was passing through
about 60 degrees left bank at a 14 degree descent angle. This obvious loss of control, in context with the CVR comments,
prompted the Safety Board to examine the role played in the loss of control by: 1)
transfer of control; 2) spatial disorientation; and 3) the attitude references.

2.9.1 Transfer of Control

There was a positive transfer of control as the second ILS approach was
aborted, when the captain stated, &quot;Oh # I got it.&quot; While the first officer never
acknowledged the release verbally, there were positive affirmations in his response to
the captain&#x27;s commands for flaps and gear. The first officer also began all radio calls
as the nonflying pilot. However, there was no subsequent positive verbal transfer of
control to the first officer prior to the loss of contro) during the second go-around.</div>

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] Thus, the PTG distinguished between the appropriate responses to a 
“sink rate” caution alert in IMC and VMC, and that distinction was absent from the AOM 
guidance. During the NTSB’s investigative hearing for this accident, the UPS flight standards 
and training manager said that “for a sink rate alert to go off, [the approach has] to be 
unstabilized,” and, thus, a go-around would be the appropriate response. However, this statement 
goes beyond the AOM guidance that indicated that only adjusting the vertical speed using pitch 
attitude or applying thrust in response to a “sink rate” caution alert (which the captain did) was 
necessary. The captain’s actions in response to the alert were consistent with the guidance 
provided in the AOM, but not the PTG. Another example of inconsistent guidance relates to the EGPWS “too low terrain” alert. Although the pilots did not receive a caution alert until after the airplane had struck the trees, a 
review of the AOM and PTG guidance indicated differences between the recommended 
responses to a “too low terrain” alert, which could create confusion for pilots on which procedure 
to use when such an alert occurs. Specifically, the PTG contained more aggressive guidance than 
the AOM for pilots addressing “too low terrain” alerts, indicating that pilots should perform the 
aggressive CFIT avoidance maneuver, which involved disengaging the autopilot, rotating the 
airplane 20º nose up, applying maximum thrust, retracting the speedbrakes, and rotating further, 
up to stick shaker if required. The AOM stated that the pilot should adjust the flightpath or go 
around. Although the PTG included more aggressive response procedures, UPS A300 pilots were 
trained and evaluated on their responses to the EGPWS alert based on the less aggressive 
guidance contained in the FAA-approved AOM, which was similar to the Airbus information. Because the EGPWS provides critical information to help a pilot avoid terrain, it is 
imperative that pilots receive appropriate and consistent training so that the response is 
immediate. Had the captain performed the CFIT-avoidance maneuver in response to the “sink 
rate” alert as specified in the PTG, performance data showed that the airplane could have 
avoided terrain. Additionally, there may have been adequate time to perform a successful 
go-around. Therefore, the NTSB concludes that the captain’s moderate response to the EGPWS 
“sink rate” caution alert (adjusting the flight’s vertical speed) was consistent with AOM 
 
107 The NTSB notes that the approach was unstabilized when the airplane passed through 1,000 ft AFE at a 
descent rate of 1,500 fpm and that the pilots should have conducted a go-around at that point. 
108 Review of Airbus guidance showed that for a sink rate alert, the flight crew should adjust the pitch attitude 
and thrust to silence the alert.</div>

an unsafe situation because they had different expectations of how the approach would be 
flown. NTSB

21. The captain’s moderate response to the enhanced ground proximity warning system “sink 
rate” caution alert (adjusting the flight’s vertical speed) was consistent with aircraft operating 
manual guidance and training; however, the response was not sufficient to prevent striking 
the trees on the approach and was not consistent with the more conservative guidance in the 
pilot training guide. 
22. The continuous descent final approach technique provides a safer alternative to “dive and 
drive” during nonprecision approaches. 
23. If operators identified and implemented ways for pilots to receive more opportunities to 
maintain proficiency in nonprecision approaches, pilots could conduct such approaches more 
safely. 
24. Due to the importance of pertinent remarks, such as variable cloud ceilings, to the flight 
crew’s understanding of weather conditions, it is critical that flight dispatch papers, the 
aircraft communication addressing and reporting system, and automatic terminal information 
service contain pertinent remarks for weather observations because such remarks provide 
flight crews a means to understand changing weather conditions. Had the flight crew been 
provided with the pertinent remarks in this accident, they may have been aware of the 
possibility of changing visibility and ceilings upon their arrival at Birmingham-Shuttlesworth 
International Airport. 
25. The newer enhanced ground proximity warning system software, part number 965-0976-003218-218 or later, will provide an advanced alert and significantly improve safety margins, 
although its effect on the outcome of this accident is unknown because it cannot be 
determined how aggressively the pilots would have responded to an earlier “too low terrain” 
alert. 
26. An escalating series of terrain awareness and warning system (TAWS) alerts before impact 
with terrain or obstacles is not always guaranteed due to technological limitations, which 
reduces the safety effectiveness of the TAWS during the approach to landing. 
27. An automated “minimums” and/or altitude above terrain alert would have potentially 
provided the flight crewmembers with additional situational awareness upon their arrival at 
the minimum descent altitude and made them aware that their continued descent would take 
them below the minimum descent altitude. 
28. In the absence of the automated “minimums” alert, either the enhanced ground proximity 
warning system 500-ft callout or the Airbus 400-ft callout could have made the flight 
crewmembers aware of their proximity to the ground, and they could have taken action to 
arrest the descent. 
29. Consistent training in and Federal Aviation Administration oversight and evaluation of 
fundamental procedures necessary to conduct an approach, such as sequencing the flight 
management computer, are critical to flight safety. 
30. A vertical deviation indicator constructed from information known to be anomalous (for 
example, containing a flightpath discontinuity) could be confusing to flight crews. NTSB

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] However, this accident 
demonstrates that this sequence of events may not occur in certain situations, particularly when 
an airplane is in the landing configuration and close to the airport. Therefore, the NTSB 
concludes that an escalating series of TAWS alerts before impact with terrain or obstacles is not 
always guaranteed due to technological limitations, which reduces the safety effectiveness of the 
TAWS during the approach to landing. Therefore, the NTSB recommends that the FAA advise 
operators of aircraft equipped with TAWS of the circumstances of this accident including that, in 
certain situations, an escalating series of TAWS warnings may not occur before impact with 
terrain or obstacles. Encourage operators to review their procedures for responding to alerts on 
final approach to ensure that these procedures are sufficient to enable pilots to avoid impact with 
terrain or obstacles in such situations. As stated above, the EGPWS alerting envelopes are reduced when an airplane is in the 
landing configuration and close to the airport to provide a balance between safe alert timing and 
nuisance alerts. However, the circumstances of this accident reveal that the EGPWS terrain 
clearance floor envelope can be ineffective when the airplane is descending at an unusually high 
descent rate, which is precisely when it is critical that a flight crew receive a warning alert as the 
airplane nears the ground. In March 2014, a special committee was established to develop an 
industry consensus set of TAWS standards reflecting the mature nature of this technology and 
incorporating enhanced requirements and new capabilities. This minimum operational 
performance standard will form the basis for the next TSO for TAWS and will take into account 
the improved technology available today. Therefore, the NTSB recommends that the FAA revise 
the minimum operational performance standards to improve the effectiveness of TAWS when an 
airplane is configured for landing and near the airport, including when the airplane is descending 
at a high rate and there is rising terrain near the airport. 
2.6.2 Terrain Awareness and Warning System Altitude Callouts 
The Airbus A300 FWC is equipped with an automated aural “minimums” alert that 
would have sounded at 0447:14, about 3 seconds after the captain said “two miles.” However, 
UPS had not activated the alert. Further, Airbus A300 airplanes can issue altitude callout alerts

through the airplane’s FWC. Rather than the 500-ft callout, many Airbus A300 operators use the 
400-ft callout generated within the FWC. Additionally, TSO-151C requires the TAWS to 
provide a 500-ft callout when descending within 500 ft above terrain or the nearest runway 
elevation. However, it does not require operators to enable the 500-ft callout feature. Neither the 
500-ft TAWS callout (through the EGPWS) nor the 400-ft callout (through the Airbus FWC) 
were activated on the accident airplane; therefore, these callouts did not occur when the airplane 
neared the terrain.</div>

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] Damage to the GA-EGPWS memory chip precluded retrieving information about the status 
of the terrain inhibit function during the flight. Examination of the terrain awareness annunciation 
control unit revealed that the terrain inhibit switch, which was an alternate action design, was in 
the uninhibited position. A computed tomography examination identified no preimpact anomaly 
that would have precluded normal operation of the switch. However, because the switch design is 
such that its position can be changed when pressed, and the separation of the face plate and 
switch-button extensions (which likely occurred during the impact sequence) could have resulted 
in significant displacement of the switch, the investigation could not exclude the possibility that 
the terrain inhibit switch was in the inhibited position at impact but changed to the uninhibited 
position during the impact sequence. The GA-EGPWS simulation performed for an estimated accident flightpath showed that, 
for an assumed level cruise flight of about 1,000 ft msl between the known data points, the 
corresponding terrain clearances would be between 500 and 700 ft agl, and the system would have 
provided continuous TAWS alerts for most of the flight. It is not known at what point during the 
final 4 minutes of the accident flight the pilot initiated the climb (or climbs) from 1,043 ft msl (the 
altitude of the last data point) to 2,300 ft msl (the elevation of the initial impact about 9 nm from 
the last data point). However, the GA-EGPWS simulation for an assumed flight profile showed 
that the system, if not inhibited, would have begun providing continuous “CAUTION TERRAIN, 
CAUTION TERRAIN” aural cautions 46 seconds before the collision, followed 10 seconds later 
(36 seconds before the collision) by a “TERRAIN, TERRAIN, PULL UP” aural warning (the 
system’s highest priority warning) that repeated “PULL UP” until the time of impact. These alerts 
would have allowed sufficient time for the pilot to respond with an escape maneuver to avoid the 
terrain. Although some wreckage evidence suggests that the accident airplane may have been in an 
aggressive climb at impact, wreckage damage precludes a definitive determination of the 
airplane’s impact angle. Thus, if the TAWS alerts were uninhibited at the time of impact (which 
is possible given the uncertainty of the position of the terrain inhibit switch at the time of impact), 
it is not known why the pilot did not respond appropriately to the alerts and perform an escape 
maneuver in time to avoid the collision. However, the NTSB notes that Hageland allowed its pilots 
to use the terrain inhibit switch to inhibit the TAWS alerts when conducting VFR flights at altitudes 
below the TAWS RTC (which is discussed further in section 2.4.3). Also, the second company

due to its relevance to this accident, the NTSB reiterates Safety Recommendation A-17-25. NTSB

3. Conclusions 3.1 Findings 
1. None of the following were factors in the accident: (1) flight crew qualifications in 
accordance with federal regulations, (2) flight crew medical conditions or impairment by 
alcohol or other drugs, or (3) airplane mechanical condition. 
2. Based on the available weather information that indicated the likelihood of decreased 
visibility due to precipitation and/or clouds in the accident area and the observation from 
a company flight crew that clouds obscured the accident site within an hour after the 
accident, the accident flight crew likely encountered instrument meteorological conditions 
before the collision with terrain. 
3. The pilot-in-command’s decision to continue the visual flight rules flight into reduced 
visibility conditions resulted in the flight entering instrument meteorological conditions. 
4. The investigation found no evidence that management or scheduling pressures, habitual 
noncompliance with company policy, or history of risk-taking behaviors influenced the 
pilot-in-command’s decision to continue the flight. 
5. Once the flight entered instrument meteorological conditions, the pilot-in-command 
should have either executed an escape maneuver or commanded the second-in-command 
to execute one. 
6. Although damage precluded determination of the preimpact position of the terrain inhibit 
switch, the terrain awareness and warning system (TAWS) alerts were likely inhibited for 
most, if not all, of the accident flight, because the flight crew otherwise would have 
received continuous TAWS alerts for most of the flight (as shown by a general aviation 
enhanced ground proximity warning system simulation), and Hageland pilots routinely 
inhibited the alerts during normal operations. 
7. Hageland’s approved crew resource management training was inadequate because it did 
not address aeronautical decision-making and judgment tailored to company operations 
and the aviation environment, as required by Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations 
135.330, and it did not provide the flight crew with procedures for flight crew 
coordination, communication, and the division of crew duties, including respective 
pilot flying/pilot monitoring responsibilities. 
8. Incorporating the operational control agents into crew resource management training for 
flight crews would better facilitate teamwork during the risk assessment process and other 
communications with flight crews. NTSB 
Aircraft Accident Report

9. Approved crew resource management training that is tailored to Hageland’s flight 
operations and aviation environment, includes defined expectations for each 
crewmember’s role and responsibilities, and addresses effective communication and 
coordination among flight crewmembers and Operations Control Center personnel, would 
provide flight crews with the skills to exercise good aeronautical decision-making and 
judgment to mitigate the risk of controlled flight into terrain.

there was enough time for the captain and first officer to try

to analyze the cause of the terrain warning, there was also more
than adequate time for the captnin to stop the descent, alter

the aircraft&#x27;s flightpath, end silence the terrain warning in
accordance with the company&#x27;s procedures. Had he taken this
action in the timely manner called for by the procedure— &quot;positive action to alter the flightpath and stop the warning should

(GPWS) aural waming, followed 4 seconds later by the sound of stick shaker
activation, and ending with the sound of ground impact at 1842:36. The captain testified that upon the initiation of the missed approach, the
airplane was at an altitude of 1,200 feet, or about 450 fect above the ground. The
FDR recorded aititude of flight 1016 at the time the missed approach was initiated
was 950 fect, or apprcximately 200 feet above the ground. Also, at the time the
captain said “down, push it down,&quot; neither he (performing the nonflying pilot duties)
nor the first officer (using instrument reference for the execution of the missed
approach) could see the ground because of the intense rain. The Safety Board
believes that the first officer had initially performed the required procedures to
reconfigure the airplane for the nonnal missed approach and began its execution. However, the Safety Board also believes that the performance of the nonflying
duties by the captain might have seriously affected his awareness of altitude; thus,
he issued the command without realizing their close proximity to the ground. A!so,
once the command was given, the captain did not monitor the first officer&#x27;s actions
or the performance of the airplane. The Safety Board studied the captain&#x27;s remark to the first officer of
“down, push it down&quot; to understand why a command such as this would have been
issued when the airplane was in very close proximity to the ground and traversing an
area of unfavorable weather. The captain testified that he did not recall issuing the
command; thus, the basis for this remark cannot be fully known with certainty. However, when the FDR data were examined and compared to various elements of the
flizht, one possible explanation for the captain&#x27;s command becaine apparent. Examination of the circumstances during the last minute of flight strongly
suggested that the captain, upon losing his visual cues instantaneously when the airplane
encountered the heavy rain, could have experienced a form of spatial disorientation. The disorientation might have led him to believe that the aircraft was climbing at an
excessively high rate and that the pitch attitude should be lowered to prevent an
acrodynamic stall. Additionally, when the airplane enccuntered the heavy rain, the
flightcrew would have lost their outside horizon visual reference. Also, it may not have
been possible for the captain to regain situational focus on the primary flight instruments
because he was performing other tasks. Further, because the flightcrew was initiating
the missed approach, which involved a large increase in engine thrust, a pronounced
increase in pitch attitude, and a banked tum to the night, the crew would have been
exposed to significant linear and angular accelerative forces. These forces could have
stimulated the flightcrew&#x27;s vestibular and proprioceptive sensory systems and produced
a form of spatial disorientation known as somatogravic illusion.</div>

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] The Safety Board believes that based on the weather conditions and
their adverse effect on aircraft performance, the flightcrew should have completely
avoided the convective activity (storm cell). However, because they did not
abandon the approach eartier, the performance of the airplane during the windshear
encounter was analyzed to determine if it was capable of successfully flying through
the windshear encounter, assuming optimum piloting technique. Simulations

revealed that given the NASA wind flow field, tne airplane could have escaped the
windshear encounter if several crew actions had been performed: First, the power
was advanced by the first officer to an EPR setting of approximately 1.82; however,
the captain did not trim to the target EPR of 1.93; second, the FDR indicated that a
positive rate of climb had been established; however, the landing gear was not
retracted; and lastly, the pitch attitude of the airplane was not maintained at or near
the target of 15° nose up. The simulations indicate that lowering the nose to 5° belaw the horizon
was the most significant factor that prevented the escape from tne wirdshear
encounter. Based on these simulations, the Safety Board concludes that flight 1016
could have successfully flown through the windshear encountered if the flightcrew
had executed an optimum missed approach procedure, and if &quot;firewall&quot; thrust had
been applied as the airspeed decreased below 120 knots. The combination of the
crew&#x27;s failure to use maximum go-around thrust, and the reduction of pitch attitude
at a critical phase of flight, resulted in the airplane descending to the ground. The
data also support the conclusion that fligtit 1016 could have overcome the windshear
encounter if the flightcrew had executed the windshear escape maneuver (maximum
effective pitch attitude and maximum &quot;firewall&quot; power) immediately after the initial
airspeed decay.

The Safety Board also examined the control column forces that the first
officer most likely experienced during the missed approach. The evidence indicates
that the pitch uim had not been changed subsequent to the initiation of the missed
approach. Given this condition, the first officer would have had to continue to
increase back pressure on the control column as the airplane slowed to maintain a
constant pitch attitude. At 115 knots, the airplane was most probably 29 knots
below the trim speed. The force required to maintain this attitude would have been
tess than 24 pounds, which was well within the capabilities of the pilot. Therefore,
control column forces might also have affected subsequent events during the missed
approacn maneuver. Specifically, when the captain directed the first officer “down,
push it down,&quot; the first officer did not have to push forward on the contro! column. He merely had to release some of the back pressure on the control column to
achieve the desired effect of lowering the nose.</div>

attention on terrain proximity&quot; to determine the validity of the warning. The beginning of the GPWS alert constituted, if not an emergency, certainly
an abnormal situation and should have made them check every available
altimeter system to fix the aircraft&#x27;s position relative to the terrain. The pilots knew they were at an altitude where the radio altimeters were
operative; they knew that the approach was being made over water; and
they knew that there were no terrain features present that would have
made the radio altimeter readout suspect. Under the circumstances,
the Safety Board concluded that an experienced flightcrew should have
checked their radio altimeters since the altimeters would have provided
them with an immediate readout of absolute altitude. In summary, the Safety Board concludes that the ATC procedures
affected the conduct of the approach, and, therefore, contributed to the
chain of events which led to the accident. Aithough the controller had
placed tne aircraft in a position from which the approach could have
been completed safely, he also had placed it in a position where the
captain had to alter the timing of his checklist procedures in order to
configure his aircraft more rapidly than usual. While the controller&#x27;s
handling of the flight did not place the aircraft in a dangerous position,
his nonstandard procedures made the approach more difficult for the crew
to accomplish. However, the accident would have been averted had the pilots
performed to the established standards expected of airline cockpit
crews. This report documents a lack of professionalisa on the crew&#x27;s
part which contributed to their inability te recover from a procedural
error on the part of the controller. The accident was survivable for several reasons: (1) The
traumatic injuries sustained by the passengers and crew indicated that
the impact forces were not sufficient to produce fatal injuries; (2)
since the water was rot deep enough to totally submerge the aircraft,
ample time was provided for evacuation, and the aircraft acted as a
platform for those awaiting rescue; (3) the sarge was inmediately

~ 34 -

accessible to the passengers; (4) the air and water temperatures were
moderate; and (5) the wind, wave, and current actions were minimal. In
additio., the actions of the captain, his flightcrew, the cabin crew,
and able-bodied passengers played a major role in insuring the survival
of the passengers until they were rescued by the tugboat and barge. The Safety Board commends the crew of the tug and barge for
their actions during the rescue. The combined actions of both the
aircraft and surface vessels&#x27; crews contrtbuted immensely to minimizing
the loss of lives in this accident. 3. CONCLUSIONS Findings

1. The aircraft&#x27;s crew and the controllers were certificated
and qualified.

2. There were no aircraft systems or aircraft structures
nalfunctions. The controller did nat follow prescribed procedures; he

did not vector the aircraft to intercept the final approach
course 2 nmi outside the approach gate; and he did not
provide the captain with advance notice of the final
descent point.</div>

the tower and the Northwest and Ransome flights confirm this. At 1709:46,
the first officer of Flight 121 said he could see the runway. Fron that
time on, the storm and its associated rainfa.* was visible to the captain
and first officer, and it should have been apparent to them that it was
within 1 mi of their touchdown point and moving toward them. They were also
aware that there rfrht be unstable wind conditions associated with the rain
from the tower&#x27;s convecsation with landing aircraft directly in front of
them. Further, they knew another air carrier aircraft ahead of them executed
a go-around and they attributed the gc-around to a wind shift. Without
doubt, the captain was aware at the OM or shortly thereafter that he could
not tand without approaching the storm, that his landing rollout most
certainly would take him into the area of rain, and that he ran the risk of
entering the storm&#x27;s leading edge before he could lard. Pilots have been exposed constantly to data warning them of the
bazards related to wind shifts and extreme gusts preceding thunderstorms,
and to information concerning the perils involved in conducting takeoffs
and landings within, or in the vicinity of, thunderstorms. The Allegheny

&quot;elight Operations Manual&quot; also cautioned pilots on this subject. The
weather-related information availatle to the crew throughout the approach
provided sufficient data for them tc: assess the storm&#x27;s position, to
anticipate the presence of a potentially severe low tevel wind shear,

and sufficient time for them to avoid penetrating it at a low altitude. The Safety Board, therefore, concludes that the appr:ach
should have been abandoned at or shortly after passing the OM, and that
this action should have been taken before they were in a position that
required the missed approach to be conducted within the stor. The crew of Flight 121 performed the initial go-around precedures
by applying power, rotating to a climb attitude, positioning the flaps,
and when a positive rate of climb was established, raising the lanling
gear. The captain said that he maintained the attitude dictated by the
command bars on the flight director instrument until che aircraft hit
the ground. When the go-around was begun, the airspeed was more thar
adequate; therefore, based on their knowledge of the power available in
the DC-9, the crew could expect the aircraft to climb out without much
difficulty. In order to determine why the aircraft did not climb as
expected, the Safety Board examined the following: (1) The capability
of the aircraft to cope with the existing weather, (2) the adequacy of
the crew&#x27;s procedures for assuring that atl of the aircraft&#x27;s go-around
potential was used; and (3) the validity of the aircraft&#x27;s instrument
presentation, particularly that of the speed command system, in a
horizontal and vertical wind shear environment.</div>

in-flight engineout emergency procedures. However, the accepted single-engine
climb technique is to fly wings-level. If a turn is required, the aircraft should be
banked slightly toward the operative engine. If these procedures are not followed,
single-engine climb petformance will be degraded. In this case, the slight left turn
was necessary to clear the radio tower which was in the flightpath because of the
reduced climb rate. In addition, the only relatively clear area on which the
aircraft might be crash landed was to the left of the aircraft&#x27;s flightpath.

2.4 Meteorological ts

Since aircraft performance and flightcrew actions should have been
aovquate to allow for a climb to a safe altitude and a return to the airport for
landing, the Safety Board looked into a possible meteorological influence on this
ace&#x27;dent. Rough terrain extends to the north and east of the accident site. Mountains to the north slcpe upward to above 7,000 ft and then downward below
3,000 ft to the Colorado River. Winds from a northerly direction will usually flow
upward on the windward side of the mountain to above 7,000 ft and then descend on
the leeward side. On the windward side of the mountains, the air flow will usually
follow the slope of the terrain. Under certain conditions of atmospheric stability,
as the air reaches the peak of the mountains it will descend following the slope of
the terrain on the leeward side. In most cases, the wid speed of the descending
air is equal to that of the ascending air. Two methods were used to calculate the effect tiis wind pattern would
have had on the accident aircraft. First, by using a logarithmic wind profile, the
wind specd at both 3,000 and 7,000 ft was estimated. An average of these two
values--20 kns--.was calculated as the wind speed likely acting on the windward
slope. The wind direction was assumed as 040°. The slope of the windward terrain
was calculated using the Las Vegas Sectional Aeronautical Chart. The terrain was
assumed to rise from 3,050 to 7,000 ft over a horizontal distance of 1.5 nmi,
yielding a slope of about 24°, The slope on the leeward side was assumed to be
equal to the slope on the windward side. A wind speed of 20 kns from a direction
and of 040° would yield a wind speed on the windward slope of 824 fpm in an

upward direction (updraft). Air that reaches the top of the slope would likely begin
to descend. The descending air follows the slope of the leeward side.</div>

which was followed by many more. As the first sharp-edged encounter started
bleeding off, we developed an almost instantaneous rate of roll at fairly high
rate. The roll was to the far left and the nose was swinging up and to the right at
a rapid rate. During the second portion of the encounter, the airplane motions
actually seemed to be negating my control inputs. I had the rudder to the
firewall, the column in my lap, and full wheel, and I wasn&#x27;t having any luck
righting the airplane. Appendix F

Aircraft Accident Report
•
The aircraft was struck by severe clear air turbulence of mountain wave origin. The winds about the time of the incident were 65 knots out of the west and 27
knots out of the south (resultant vector magnitude 70 knots).
Additional information regarding the above incident:
From Boeing memorandum on January 28, 1964:
•
Turbulence in the lee of a peak due to high winds can be expected to cause
some sharp-edged gusts which may excite structural modes.
•
The airplane is believed to have flown through an area containing the
combined effects of a rotor associated with a mountain wave and lateral shear
due to airflow around a large peak.
•
The gust initially built up from the right to a maximum of about 45 feet per
second (TAS) [true airspeed], then reversed to a maximum of 36 feet per
second (TAS) from the left, before swinging to a straight downdraft of 85 feet
per second (TAS). Next, there was a build-up to a maximum of about 147 feet
per second (TAS) from the left, followed by a return to 31 feet per second
(TAS).
•
This pattern of variation of gust velocity and intensity is believed to be
consistent with the probable occurrence of mountain waves in the area. Its
character is essentially that which is associated with the rotor or roll cloud,
which stands in the lee of a ridge at approximately the same altitude. From &quot;Turbulent Kinetic Energy Budgets Over Mountainous Terrain,&quot; Theodore
S. Karcostas and John D. Marwitz, Journal of Applied Meteorology, February 1980:
•
Airflow around Elk Mountain in Wyoming. The streamlines diverge on the
windward side of the mountain and converge behind it, causing the air to flow
up the lee slope. A flow separation occurred due to a contribution of factors,
including the adverse pressure gradient, the friction and the shape of the
mountain. A reverse eddy-type flow occupied the space between the separated
streamlines and the mountain. The separated area was characterized by
generally high mixing rates, lower wind speed and regions of systematic
reverse flow. This reversal was accompanied by the formation of a large
semipermanent eddy. The wind speed increased along either side of the
mountain. Due to the flow separation, two high speed jets of 18 meters per
second were present on each side of the mountain.
•
A rather interesting phenomenon was observed downwind of Elk.</div>

criteria in determining the circling approach area. Attachment No. 2
illustrates this area around the Emmet County Airport, and shows that 300
or more feet obstruction clearance is provided. N434EJ flew outside the
area while proceeding west during the circling approach, and was outside
the area when initial contact with the trees was made. The reasons for the flight&#x27;s leaving the area are not known. It is quite possible, for example, that the scattered clouds may have
caused the captain to extend his flightpath. The FSS specialist stated
that at times the aircraft disappeared as the flight went in and out of
scud. No doubt this was due to the scattered clouds at 400 feet. However,
in view of the FSS specialist&#x27;s location, the aircraft might have disappeared
behind the clouds, and not have gone in and out of them. Another reason
is the difficulty in determining the 1.7-mile limit. In most cases, this
would be a difficult task in the daytime, much less at night. The lack of
visual cues at night can cause a pilot to think that he is closer to the
runway and higher than he really is.. The hazards of night approaches over
areas lacking visual cues are well known, and have been publicized. One

authority states, &quot;Under conditions of haze, smoke, dust, glare, or
darkness, expect to be higher than you are.&quot; 6/ He also states that
shadows are a key factor in depth perception, and that their absence, when
due to visibility restrictions, unknowingly confuses the pilot. Under
such conditions, the pilot interprets his altitude as being higher than

it actually is. &quot;This effect is also encountered during night (especially
blackout) landings.&#x27;&quot;&#x27; Captain Prosper Cocquyt explains in his paper,
&quot;Sensory Illusions,&quot; that a pilot determines his relative height by estimation of the distance to landmarks and the angle between the direction

of observation of the landmarks and his horizon. This angle is usually
positive, as the landmarks are usually observed below his horizon. When
the pilot&#x27;s observation of his horizon is not the true horizon,. then the
angle becomes the original angle plus the included angle between the true
and imagined horizon. Cocquyt states that when imaginary heights are
positive, the pilot has the sensation of flying higher than his true height. Imaginary ground is above the actual ground beyond the landmarks. Thus in
the case of night flying, the pilot may see stars below his imaginary
horizon and mistake them for ground lights. A serious hazard arises if an
optical illusion, resulting in an imaginary height, persists during the
course of the landing procedure. The Board believes that the illusions caused by the darkness
and lack of visual cues in the area of the circling approach were such
that the pilot could not determine his altitude accurately enough by use
of visual cues solely. Use of the altimeter is a necessity in such circumstances. The course taken by the pilot, after departing the inbound course
from the VOR, took him over terrain higher than that at the accident site. Therefore, a descent had to have been initiated.

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS AND CONCLUSIONS &gt; ANALYSIS] The Board believes that the illusions caused by the darkness
and lack of visual cues in the area of the circling approach were such
that the pilot could not determine his altitude accurately enough by use
of visual cues solely. Use of the altimeter is a necessity in such circumstances. The course taken by the pilot, after departing the inbound course
from the VOR, took him over terrain higher than that at the accident site. Therefore, a descent had to have been initiated. This could have occurred ©
after he began his turn back to an easterly heading, towards the final
portion of the approach. If the pilot elected to proceed visually from
this point on, he could have believed that he was higher than he really
was. With the runway in sight, the first officer may not have been calling
or observing the altitude. The aircraft, prior to beginning the descent
&#x27; from the circling approach, could have been at any altitude between the
600 feet minimum and 800 feet, the height of the measured ceiling. It is
not known which altimeter the first officer was watching, but since the
circling approach was to the left, it would have been likely for the first
officer to have been looking out the left side of the cockpit toward the
airport at times, while monitoring the instruments. In such a case, he
may have been obtaining his altitude information from the captain&#x27;s
altimeter.

(2) The Captain&#x27;s Altimeter and Night Illusions

On a 2.5° glidepath, an aircraft would be at an altitude of
230 feet above the runway when 1 mile from the touchdown point. On a 2°
glidepath, the altitude above the runway would be 184 feet at the same

distance. N434EJ first struck trees at ‘an altitude of 886 feet, or 166
feet above the elevation of the airport. Although, as pointed out earlier,
the illusions at night due to lack of visual cues could lead the pilot to
believe that he was higher than he actually was. However, it must be
considered that the pilot may have known his location and was determining
his vertical position, during the approach, from his altimeter. For the
sake of this argument, lack of visual cues for altitude determination must
be considered to have had little effect. In such a situation, a pilot
would not have flown at an altitude of 166 feet above the runway elevation
on a heading of approximately 50° from the runway heading so far from the
threshold, since this would require a turn toward the runway at a dangerously low altitude, particularly at night. . However, an altimeter which
read too high could have caused the pilot to have believed that he was
sufficiently high so as to safely traverse the area. In view of the condition of the captain&#x27;s altimeter, such a situation is highly possible,
provided the first officer also looked at the captain&#x27;s altimeter during
this critical portion of the approach.

ability to see and safely avoid terrain while making the visual transition from the 
instrument approach to an intended landing. The reduced visibility and light snow 
showers near the airport would have further degraded the flight crew’s ability to see and 
safely avoid the terrain. This accident reveals that the aeronautical definition of night does not adequately 
take into account darkness in mountainous terrain. Specifically, because pilots do not 
have sufficient ambient lighting to see and safely avoid unlighted terrain during periods 
of darkness before official night, the night restriction on the VOR/DME-C approach is 
not enough to ensure safety of flight. Thus, nighttime restrictions may not sufficiently 
mitigate potential hazards associated with flight operations into ASE and other airports 
with mountainous terrain during periods of darkness.61 
 
60 On February 21, 2002, an ASE tower controller observed the sun fully set behind the terrain 
about 1725. At that time, the elevation of the sun was 4.2º, resulting in a visible sunset that was about 26 
minutes earlier than the official sunset of 1751. On the night of the accident, the sun was at an elevation of 
4.2º about 1803, resulting in a visible sunset that was about 25 minutes earlier than official sunset. 
61 To address this issue, the Safety Board issued Safety Recommendation A-02-08 on April 15, 
2002. Safety Recommendation A-02-08 asked the FAA to “revise any restrictions and prohibitions that 
currently reference or address ‘night’ or ‘nighttime’ flight operations in mountainous terrain so that those 
restrictions and prohibitions account for the entire potential period of darkness or insufficient ambient light 
conditions, and establish a method to clearly communicate to flight crews when such restrictions and 
prohibitions apply.”

SUMMARY 
 
1. The flight crew made numerous procedural errors and deviations during 
the final approach segment of the VOR/DME approach to Aspen (ASE). 
 
• The flight crew crossed step-down fixes below the minimum specified 
altitudes. 
• The flight crew descended below the minimum descent altitude (MDA), 
even though airplane maneuvers and comments on the cockpit voice 
recorder (CVR) indicated that neither pilot had established or maintained 
visual contact with the runway or its environment. 
• Contrary to the airplane manufacturer’s procedures, the captain deployed 
the spoilers after the landing gear had been extended and the final landing 
flaps had been selected, and he set engine power to 55 percent N2 rather 
than 64 percent N2. 
• When the airplane was 1.4 miles from the runway (about 21 seconds 
before the accident), the captain asked, “where’s it at?” but did not 
abandon the approach, even though he had not identified, or had lost 
visual contact with, the runway. 
• Radar data and CVR comments indicated that, until the airplane began 
turning to the left about 10 seconds before the accident, the flight crew 
probably did not have the runway or its environment in sight. 
 
2. The crew demonstrated poor crew coordination during the accident 
flight. 
 
• The captain did not discuss the instrument approach procedure, the missed 
approach procedure, and other required elements during his approach 
briefing because he expected to execute a visual approach to the airport. 
• The captain and the first officer did not make required instrument 
approach callouts, and the first officer did not call out required course, fix, 
and altimeter information. 
• The flight crew did not discuss a missed approach after receiving a third 
report of a missed approach to the airport and a report of deteriorating 
visibility in the direction of the approach course. 
 
3. The flight crew was under pressure to land at ASE. 
 
• Because of the flight’s delayed departure from Los Angeles International 
Airport and the landing curfew at ASE, the flight crew could attempt only 
one approach to the airport before having to divert to the alternate airport. 
• The charter customer had a strong desire to land at ASE, and his 
communications before and during the flight most likely heightened the 
pressure on the flight crew.</div>

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] Instead, the flight crewmembers might have viewed this 
information as a barrier to achieving their intended goal of landing at ASE, causing them 
not to recognize the increasing evidence supporting the need for an alternate course of 
action. Visual Factors 
 
When the VOR/DME-C instrument approach procedure was first established at 
ASE in December 1988, the procedure was not authorized at night. The FAA removed 
the night restriction from the procedure in October 1994 because of complaints from user 
groups. In March 2001, the instrument approach procedure was again restricted at night 
after an FAA flight inspection determined that areas of unlighted terrain conflicted with 
traffic patterns and circling descent maneuvers near the airport. The night restriction on the VOR/DME-C instrument approach procedure did not 
restrict the procedure during evening civil twilight. However, the decrease in ambient 
illumination during civil twilight results in a decrease in contrast between objects and the 
background scene, which diminishes a pilot’s ability to visually distinguish between 
terrain features and the sky and to visually detect unlighted objects. The amount of ambient light decreases by two orders of magnitude (that is, about 
100 times) from the beginning to the end of evening civil twilight. Also, the sky during 
civil twilight can be much brighter than terrain features, and pilots may be exposed to 
higher ambient light levels at altitude before descent. Pilots may also experience rapid 
decreases in ambient illumination during approach and descent, especially in 
mountainous areas where terrain features may rise above the horizon and reduce the 
amount of ambient illumination at lower elevations. The mountainous terrain 
surrounding ASE reduces the amount of ambient lighting during evening civil twilight at 
lower elevations, including positions on and near the airfield. Although this accident occurred only 7 minutes after the end of evening civil 
twilight and the beginning of night, the mountainous terrain created twilight and 
nighttime conditions much earlier. The controller-in-charge stated, in a postaccident 
interview, that the sky was “very dark” in the minutes before the accident. In fact, the

Safety Board calculated that the sun had set below the mountainous terrain about 
25 minutes before the official sunset time60 and that evening civil twilight ended about 
1830 rather than 1855. Also, the shadow for the ridge immediately to the west of the 
accident site would have crossed the accident site 79 minutes earlier than official sunset. As a result, the dark conditions would have significantly degraded the flight crew’s 
ability to see and safely avoid terrain while making the visual transition from the 
instrument approach to an intended landing. The reduced visibility and light snow 
showers near the airport would have further degraded the flight crew’s ability to see and 
safely avoid the terrain. This accident reveals that the aeronautical definition of night does not adequately

these risk factors were present for the pilot during the last minute of the accident flight. Attempts to continue visual flight into IMC may be even more problematic for
helicopter pilots than for pilots of fixed-wing aircraft because helicopters are inherently
less stable and require near continuous control inputs from the pilot. Helicopters, like the
accident helicopter, that are not equipped for IFR flight and do not have control
stabilization or autopilot systems can impose high perceptual and motor demands on the
pilot. These helicopters can make it very challenging for pilots to maintain stable flight by
referring to flight instruments alone. When the accident pilot attempted to continue visual
flight into IMC, he would have been subjected to a high workload in order to maintain
control of the helicopter. Moreover, the extent of the weather echoes and the duration of
the sustained turn captured by the radar track suggest that the encounter with IMC was Analysis

prolonged. This would have further complicated the pilot’s workload and increased the
potential for spatial disorientation resulting from hazardous illusions, thereby, increasing
the potential for inappropriate control input responses. In the absence of evidence indicating a mechanical malfunction, severe
turbulence,89 or some other factor that would explain the accident pilot’s apparent loss of
control of the helicopter, spatial disorientation is the most likely explanation. The Safety
Board concludes that the helicopter’s descending spiral flightpath, which became
increasingly erratic in the final seconds of the flight, was consistent with pilot spatial
disorientation.
2.3.2 Pilot’s Decision-making
Although the pilot likely encountered areas of deteriorating weather and IMC near
the accident site, photographs recovered from a passenger’s camera showed areas of
clearer weather along the coastline, east of the helicopter’s position, as it exited Waialeale
Crater. The lower terrain between the helicopter and the coastline and the height of the
clouds would have permitted a safe deviation in that direction. Furthermore, Bali Hai
pilots were authorized to fly as low as 1,000 feet agl from the crater toward the coast; thus,
the pilot could have flown in the direction of better weather, while remaining in
compliance with SFAR 71 and the certificate of waiver or authorization requirements. Rather than deviate to the east, however, the pilot chose to fly south, along his usual tour
route adjacent to Kahili Ridge, as the advancing line of clouds closed in on the high
terrain. The pilot’s decision to fly into an area of deteriorating weather and high terrain,
despite the availability of a safer route to the east, was an error that played an important
causal role in this accident, and the Safety Board considered many factors that may have
influenced that decision.
2.3.2.1 Inexperience with Local Weather Patterns
The accident pilot had been flying commercial air tours for Bali Hai on Kauai for
less than 2 months. Nearly all of his previous flight experience had been gained as a
military pilot with the Indian Air Force.</div>

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] Nearly all of his previous flight experience had been gained as a
military pilot with the Indian Air Force. Though the pilot was experienced in helicopter
operations and claimed previous mountain and coastal flying experience, he had few flight
hours as a commercial air tour pilot and had limited knowledge of Kauai’s weather
patterns. The pilot had no previous experience flying in Hawaii before he was hired by
Bali Hai, and he began conducting tour flights after accruing just 6.7 hours of flight
training from company personnel, none of which included specific training on Kauai
weather. Many experienced local air tour pilots interviewed after the accident stated that
VFR helicopter operations on Kauai were unusually challenging because of the rugged
terrain, mountain winds, and rapidly changing visibility and cloud conditions. They stated
89 The forecast included only moderate turbulence, and the weather study found no evidence to indicate
a likelihood of severe turbulence. Analysis
39
Aircraft Accident Report
that these conditions rendered traditional sources of pilot weather information, such as
automated reporting stations and FSS briefings, not very useful, and that this heightened
the importance of a pilot’s skill in visually assessing changes in weather conditions during
tour flights. The experienced pilots indicated that a pilot’s skill in assessing changing
weather conditions and anticipating the effect of any changes on flying conditions was
critical for effective decision-making. They stated that such skills improved as local flying
experience increased. This raises concern about the impact of local inexperience on the
safety of pilot decision-making. A review of the eight weather-related air tour accidents
that have occurred in Hawaii since SFAR 71’s implementation revealed that four of the
accidents involved pilots who had relatively low experience flying air tours in Hawaii. In
fact, three of the accidents involved pilots who had flown there for less than 2 months. It is highly unlikely that the accident pilot would have decided to continue into the
area of deteriorating weather conditions and attempted to cross in the vicinity of the
accident site if he had accurately assessed the changing weather and had appreciated how
it would likely affect flight visibility in those areas. Therefore, the pilot’s decision to fly in
the vicinity of the accident site indicates that he was unable to accurately assess how
rapidly or to what extent the weather was deteriorating in that area. As described earlier in
this report, the pilot had previously told a passenger that he had flown through thin clouds
during a ridge crossing because he could see through the clouds. The pilot may have
expected that this would be the case during the accident flight; however, visibility was
dramatically reduced along the top of the ridge as the incoming line of weather reached
the high terrain. The Safety Board concludes that the pilot’s inexperience with Hawaii weather
conditions affected his ability to make appropriate in-flight decisions when faced with
deteriorating weather.</div>

previous tours reported that the helicopter encountered some turbulence, rain, and high
winds. Weather radar data indicated that a line of weather echoes containing rain showers
was converging on the ridge near the accident location about the time of the accident. This line of echoes was associated with a lowering of cloud bases below 2,400 feet
msl and obscuration of the higher terrain in the area where the accident occurred. ATC
radar data indicate that the helicopter passed over terrain elevations as high as 3,000 feet;
thus, the pilot likely encountered areas of restricted visibility as he attempted to cross the
ridge. Analysis
37
Aircraft Accident Report
ATC radar data was of limited use in helping investigators understand the
helicopter’s movements because the helicopter’s mode C transponder was not functioning
properly and transmitted erroneous altitude data; damage precluded postaccident testing
of the unit. As a result, the available data provided only a two-dimensional ground track
for the flight. The data showed that, as the helicopter crossed the top of the ridge, it
entered a clockwise, spiral pattern for the remaining 47 seconds of flight. This spiral track
grew increasingly erratic before ending near the location of the aircraft wreckage, which
suggests that the pilot was unable to maintain a stable heading. Without accurate altitude
data, however, it is impossible to know what changes in altitude may have accompanied
these changes in ground track. The accident site was on a 75º slope, and the wreckage debris was scattered up the
slope. Observed wreckage damage included fragmented skids and cross tubes, heavier
crush damage on the right side of the cabin than the left, downward deformation of the tail
boom, and evidence of a high engine-power setting. These damage characteristics and the
wreckage debris distribution suggest that, when the helicopter struck the sloping terrain, it
was in an extreme nose-high attitude with a high engine-power setting, neither of which
are consistent with what would be expected for controlled cruise or maneuvering flight. Although it is possible that the pilot may have seen the terrain through the clouds
moments before impact and added control inputs in an attempt to avoid it, the erratic,
zigzagging ground track that preceded the impact suggests that the pilot lost control of the
helicopter before the collision.
2.3
Human Performance
2.3.1 Spatial Disorientation
Spatial disorientation has contributed to many accidents involving loss of control. In these cases, loss of control follows the pilot’s inappropriate control resulting from
confusion about the aircraft’s attitude. Major situational risk factors for spatial
disorientation include sustained turns, high workload, false surface planes created by
sloping clouds or terrain, and transitions between VMC and IMC that require shifting
visual attention between external visual references and cockpit flight instruments. All of
these risk factors were present for the pilot during the last minute of the accident flight. Attempts to continue visual flight into IMC may be even more problematic for
helicopter pilots than for pilots of fixed-wing aircraft because helicopters are inherently
less stable and require near continuous control inputs from the pilot.</div>

have provided the crew an opportunity to establish a stabilized approach. However, the
Safety Board must point out that the opportunity for the captain to have asked for radar
vectors was always available. Instead, the approach was continued and the airplane was
never established on the localizer or GS. Although the crew might have been able to make a landing, it would have been
unsafe. In darkness and under the existing weather conditions, it would have been
difficult for the flighterew to have recognized an excessive rate of descent until the
airplane was very low. In addition, the flightcrew probably was susceptible to visual
illusions because there were no other ground lights for reference in the appr: ich zone,
there was water on the windshield, and there was a slight upslope to the runway. These
conditions would have combined to produce a perception that the airplane was higher than
it actually was in relation to the runway. To make a visual approach, a pilot must constantly interpret the changing
visual scene to remain oriented on the proper glidepath to the runway. Pilots must judge
height, speed, distance, and glidepath based on perceived movement of external objects,
their brightness, and their apparent size as well as their relationship to the horizon and
with other objects, and with respect to the airplane&#x27;s orientation in space or its angular
relationship with the runway. Thus, visual perception is a decision-making process based
on a multitude of visual cues,

At night, because visual cues are reduced and are further degraded by weather
and sloping terrain, pilots must rely to a greater extent on flight and navigation
instruments to reach the runway safely. The reduced number of visual cues, such as the

runway and approach lights, mey well provide images that ean be interpreted
inaccurately, causing pilots to make inappropriate decisions. In this instance, flight 1808
could have become visual at about 1 to 11/2 miles from the airport. Therefore, the
crewmembers would only have seen the 3,000-foot long approach light system and perhaps
the runway threshold. Without further foveal or peripheral visual cues, an {{illusion would
bs created that the airplane was too high in relation to the expected visual light scene,
i.@., 3,000 feet of approech lights plus 5,000 feet of runway lights. An additional visual
iflusion would have been creaced by the featureless and unlit terrain surrounding and
preceding the approach lighting system. This is called the &quot;black-hole approach” and
concerns approach to a lighted runway (or in this case to the approach lighting svstem)
over dark featureless terrain beyond which the horizon is not discernible. Simulated tests
of both visual conditions have shown that a pilot tends to descend along the are of a
eirele, the circumference of which touches the ground short of the runway lights.</div>

transmission, 12 minutes later, the balloon was over much denser clouds that restricted visual 
contact with the ground (see figure 8 on figure 14). 
Once in these conditions, the pilot had two choices: (1) continue flight over the clouds, 
hoping to reestablish visual contact with the ground or (2) descend in current conditions with likely 
visibility restrictions. Both courses of action presented significant risks. If the pilot had chosen to 
continue flight above the clouds, the conditions might not have improved. Figure 8 on figure 14 
appears to show clouds extending to the horizon, a greater distance than the balloon could fly with 
less than 1 hour of fuel remaining. If the pilot had chosen to continue, he might have found himself 
in similar conditions but with less fuel to maneuver or adjust the landing approach. Descending in 
the current conditions (from above a ceiling) presented hazards as well. Descending through a hole 
in the clouds, or in reduced visibility, would have made it more difficult to select an appropriate 
landing site and would have decreased the possibility that the pilot would be in a position to 
continuously see and avoid obstacles. Both choices presented hazards that could only have been 
avoided had the pilot not decided to climb above the clouds. The pilot’s earlier decision to climb above the clouds led to his subsequent decision to 
descend the balloon through, or very near to, clouds that obscured potential obstacles along the 
balloon’s descent path. Because of the clouds, towers and, to an even greater degree, power lines 
would be difficult for the pilot to see as he descended. Further, because his ground crew could not 
see the balloon, they were not aware of where he was making the descent. As a balloon pilot 
testifying at the NTSB’s investigative hearing stated, his ground crew is always trained to watch 
for power lines.60 Such coordination provides an extra safety layer as the balloon descends, and 
that was not present in this accident. The FAA recognizes power lines as perhaps the most

significant obstacle to balloon flight.61 In addition, during the hearing, another balloon pilot 
testifying about the difficulty of detecting power lines stated, “You’re not so much looking for 
power lines… you’re looking for towers.”62 Thus, having clear visibility of the landing area is 
critical to a safe landing so that the balloon pilot can detect, then maneuver to avoid, obstacles 
including power lines and towers; the pilot did not ensure that he had such visibility. Thus, the 
NTSB concludes that the pilot’s decision to land in reduced visibility conditions that diminished 
his ability to see and avoid obstacles resulted in the balloon impacting power lines that were 
obscured by low clouds and/or fog.

they used these weather observations and forecasts as their basis for cancelling their flights that 
day.58 The pilot should have interpreted the weather information that he obtained to indicate the 
possibility of fog formation and lower ceilings than those observed; a prudent pilot would have 
obtained an updated forecast. If the pilot had sought updated weather information just before 
launch, he might have recognized that conditions for the area were not suitable for flight because, 
in addition to the possible formation of fog, the balloon likely could not remain clear of clouds, 
compromising the pilot’s ability to see and avoid obstacles during landing. Thus, the NTSB 
concludes that, although earlier forecasts, observations, and conditions present at the launch site 
indicated VFR weather, sufficient information was available (observed fog and a temperature/dew 
point spread of 1oC) to anticipate that conditions might deteriorate. Thus, the pilot’s failure to 
obtain updated weather information denied him information that indicated conditions were 
deteriorating and might not remain VFR, which resulted in his decision to launch when he should 
have cancelled. 
2.2.2 En Route Decision-Making 
 
Photographs recorded on some passengers’ PEDs indicated that fog and low clouds were 
visible along the flight route by 2 minutes after launch (see figure 2 on figure 14). In addition, 
open fields that appear suitable for landing are visible in passenger photographs taken about the 
same time (see figures 2 and 3 on figure 14). The balloon is shown in reduced visibility conditions 
about 23 minutes later (see figure 7 on figure 14), suggesting that the transition into the clouds was 
not abrupt and, based on the generally open terrain along the flight route, that other safe landing 
sites, although not photographed, were likely available before the balloon entered the clouds. The pilot did not decide to land during the portions of flight that occurred before passenger 
photographs show the balloon encountered widespread clouds. In addition, the pilot had landing 
opportunities after first encountering the widespread clouds. The ground was visible for significant 
portions of the flight after the balloon first encountered widespread clouds and long before the 
pilot elected to climb above them. The ground was still visible through thin clouds in photographs 
taken at 0722 and 0724 (some of the last photographs taken before the balloon climbed above the 
overcast cloud layer). Earlier photographs, not reproduced in this report, also showed the ground 
visible in clear condition or through thin clouds.59 Further, as previously indicated, the terrain over 
which the balloon was flying was mostly open fields. Thus, the pilot had many opportunities to 
descend while maintaining visual contact with the ground and potential obstacles.</div>

west side of Lake George said there was light rain falling at the time
and that the winds were moderate, Another witness said it was raining
hard, but she also said, &quot;It (the explosion at impact) was so bright
as to silhouette the trees and each indtvidual branch,&quot; It could not
have been raining very hard at the time for her to have been able to
see that well, as she was located over 4 miles from the site,

Witnesses along the eastern shore of Lake George said it was
raining hard vith strong gusty winds. However, one of these witnesses,
who was driving ulong Pilot Knob Road, was able to see the aircraft. His misconception as to the heading of the flight just prior to impact
is quite possible attributable to the intermittent nature of nis
ob3ervaticn, Attention to driving, combined with intervening trees
and existing weather conditions, precluded constant observation, The
steady red light vhich he observed on the aircraft presumably was the
lower rotating re! beacon which was lighted but probably not rotating.
(It had been reported as not rotating earlier that day by Meintenance
Operations.)

We believe strong winds may have been the reason that some of the
witnesses considered the rainfall heavy. Actually, only 0.27 of an
ineh of rain fell at Warren County Airport on November 19,

Based upon a complete review of the witness statements, we conclude
that MO-411 was beneath the clouds in the vicinity of Glens Falls and

during much of the flight north of Glens Falls. In particular, it is

noted that the flight was beneath the clouds from the west side of Lake
George to within 1 mile of the accident site and was visible from the
ground during at least part of the last minute of flight prior to
impect. Whether the descent was initiated to clear clouds in the area or
because the 10 NM DME was reached could, not be determined. Suffice
it to say that descent initiation at 1 minute and 8 seconds prior to
impact was intentional by the crew. The momentary level-off at 23
seconds prior to impact could have been a reeult of the turn reversal
from 168° to 186° or it could have been a belated, intentional
level-off that should have occurred at 2,700 feet, Regardless of the
cause for the 6-second level-off, the indicated airspeed began to drop
immediately thereafter and to fluctuate. In the period 12 seconds
before impact, the airspeed decreased from 110 knots to 84 knots.</div>

The Board concludes from the foregoing that the crew of MO-h11l
tuitiated a letdown from 3,000 feet about 1 minute and 8 seconds
prior to impact. Turns were made thereafter, either in an endeavor
to remain clear of clouds, or because of the aircraft&#x27;s approaching

was probably concentrating on the turns, the aircraft encountered

by the book, &quot;Aviation Weather for Pilots and Flight Operations
Personnel” which is a joint publication of the FAA and the

Weather Bureau: &quot;A wuch disturbed condition occurs when wind

blows over large mountain ridges. The wind blowi.z up the
windward slope, in a stable atmosphere, is usually relatively
smooth. However, it spills rapidly down the leeward side, setting
up strong downdrafts and causing turbulence in a situation

which can be compared to water flowing down a rough stream bed,
These downdrafts may be dangerous and can place an aircraft in

a position from which it might not be able to recover. Pilots
should allow for this condition when approaching mountain

ridges against the wind. If the wind is strong and the ridges
pronounced, several thousand feet above the highest obstruction

is recommended in crossing the area, It is important to climb

to the crossing altitude well before reaching the mountains to
avoid having to climb (or trying to climb) in a persistent downdraft,

&quot;Pilots should be extremely cautious when attempting to cross
high mountain ranges uncex strong wind conditions because winds
over ridges and through passes ani narrow valleys usually are
much stronger and more turbulent than the general wind flow.

view, reduced image resolution, and the presence of digital noise. Low lighting conditions can 
result in a lower contrast NVG image and increased digital noise. Such images are more difficult 
to interpret and may cause a tendency to fly lower in an effort to improve image quality. The 
presence of meteorological obscurants like rain or snow has the potential to further degrade NVG 
image quality. The effect of precipitation on image quality can be unpredictable and can change 
with the nature and intensity of the precipitation. Thus, meteorological and astronomical 
forecasts that included low light, rain, and snow indicated the potential for degraded NVG 
effectiveness and increased risk of an inadvertent encounter with IMC. Therefore, the NTSB 
concludes that, at the time the pilot was notified about the stranded snowmobiler, sufficient 
information was available to indicate that the mission carried a high degree of risk due to the 
weather and low lighting conditions. The investigation revealed no evidence that Alaska DPS managers ever pressured the 
pilot to accept or complete a flight. Thus, it does not appear that the pilot was subjected to any 
direct management pressure to accept or continue SAR missions. However, the pilot was 
described as having exceptionally high motivation for flying-related tasks, and he took great 
pains to make sure that he and the helicopter were always available for any DPS missions. He 
had frequent conflicts with maintenance personnel over the timeliness of required maintenance 
and rarely took time off because he did not want to miss opportunities for flying. The pilot 
reportedly enjoyed flying the helicopter and had achieved a high level of VFR helicopter flying 
proficiency. Putting this skill to use likely provided some intrinsic satisfaction. The pilot’s 
spouse said that the pilot was very close to his own family, and he appreciated being able to 
bring other people safely back to theirs. In addition, records indicate that the pilot had received a 
great deal of public recognition for past rescues. His personnel file contained many heartfelt 
letters of thanks from people he had rescued, and he had received several high-profile awards. In 
addition, a substantial amount of the pilot’s income came from being on call and flying missions 
outside of his scheduled work hours. Colleagues and supervisors said that the pilot was very 
sensitive to any changes in aircraft section operating policies that could reduce his pay, such as 
reducing his standby time by using the relief pilot. The relief pilot said that the pilot feared being 
replaced if other pilots were allowed to fly more missions. As a result of these multiple sources 
of motivation, the pilot carefully guarded his role as the helicopter’s primary pilot.</div>

glidepath during a visual descent to landing. The fog might have obscured the PAPI
due to the reported failure of the high intensity light position. In that case, any
visual flightpath information might not have been observed by the captain and might
have contributed to a higher than normal approach path. The survivor stated that the captain pointed out the landing light switch
on the overhead panel and told him, &quot;when I tell you to, turn it on.&quot; At some point
in the approach, the captain instructed the survivor to &quot;tum it on.&quot; When the light
was tumed on, according to the survivor, &quot;it was like a strobe light.&quot; The captain
then quickly said, &quot;turn it off.” Estimates of the thickness of the fog layer varied. The survivor estimated the fog to be about 10 feet thick; the Learjet copilot
estimated it to be between 15 and 20 feet; and airport personne! stated that it was 20
to 30 feet or more. The Safety Board believes that the landing light might have been
tumed on during a critical phase of the landing as the airplane entered the reduced
visibility area. The &quot;whiteout effect” might have caused the captain to temporarily
lose sight of the runway due to the light. The Safety Board also believes that the
lack of visual cues for landing could have caused the captain to lower his rate of
descent while trying to visually reacquire the runway, when he should have been
initiating a go-around maneuver. The survivor stated that the captain was moving the contro] column as
though he was &quot;fishing&quot; for the runway. After landing, the braking was hard before
impact, according to the survivor. The survivor stated that ne could see the runway
markings. The Safety Board believes that as a nonflying passenger in the copilot
seat, he was most likely looking down and out the side window, and was therefore
able to see markings on the runway. The captain, on the other hand, probably
would be looking forward and out the front windscreen for landing, and therefore
would have had a greater slant range viewing distance to the runway with increased
obscuration from fog. If the captain was, in fact, “fishing” for the runway, this
suggests that he was satisfied with the airplane’s alignment with the runway, and
that he believed he was only slightly above the paved surface. Initial touchdown
was not on runway centerline, but was on the paved surface with immediate
correction toward centerline during rollout.</div>

was informed that the visibility had dropped to
1/4 mile in fog prior to the initiation of the
approach. The Board believes that the pilot used
poor judgment in attempting the approach
under the weather conditions which prevailed. PROBABLE CAUSE

The National Transportation Safety Board
determines that the probable cause of this
accident was the lack of altitude awareness on
the part of the flightcrew while descending into
known weather conditions which were
conducive to a rapid deterioration in forward
visibility. ‘The Board belioves that the action of
the crew might have been influenced by a visual
illusory effect produced by a shellow layer of
dense fog, combined with the relative position
of the sun. RECOMMENDATIONS

The number of accidents that have occurred
during recent years which have involved an
attempted landing approach in weather condi-

tions wherein visibilities near or below specified
landing mitrima is a matter of utmost concern to
the Safety Board. ‘The Board has previously
made recommendations to the FAA. These
recommendations kave related to regulatory
changes, improved pilot training aids, the promulgation of information regarding specifically
defined hazards, and the development of vertical
guidance and ground proximity warning hardware. This accident reemphasizes the need for
improvement in these areas. The Board. therefore, urges the FAA to reconsider all these
previous recommendations for immediate
implementation. As a result of this accident, the Safety Board
recommends that:

The FAA ensure widespread dissemination
of information to pilots in all segments of
aviation regarding the potential hazards
associated with weather conditions characterized by a partial obscuration of the sky
caused by a shallow layer of dense fog.

‘fhe Board acknowledges the FAA’s issuance
of Advisory Circulars No, 91-25A, and No.
90.60 both of which provide information regarding the loss of visual cucs during low visibility
landings. The Board Lelieves that a more
detailed training-aid should be published which
describes the visual illusory effects that can be
produced by descent into shallow fog. The Board notes and supports the PAA in its
issuance of Air Carrier Operations Bulletin No.
71-9, which emphasizes the common faults
noted in nonprecision approaches and proposes
several recommendations to climinate such
faults. The Board believes that this type of infor:
mation should be promulgated to the gencral
aviation public,

The Board also notes and supports the FAA&#x27;s
Notice of Proposed Rule Making 72-17 entided
Landing Minimums which was issued July 20,
1972, and recommends expeditious action in
incorporating these changes to the Federal
Aviation Regulations which will restrict the Part
91 operator from initiating an approach when
the reported visibility is less than the specified
landing minima.</div>

plished at the correct altitudes. The runway environment was acquired visually by the
flightcrew before DH,and the captain believed that the
aircraft was in the proper position to complete the
landing. The flightcrew gave no indication to the contr&gt;] tower
that they experienced difficulty with any portion of the
approach,

Significant horizonial wind shear existed in the final
approach path of Flight 516. The meteorological conditions were conducive to the
creation of visusl illusions,

The glide slope aberration, the wind shear,and the
visual illusion combined to give the captain a false
impression of the relative attitude and altitude of
the aircraft after he passed the MM. After the aircraft had passed the MM, the first offices
twice informed the captain that the rate of descent was
increasing.

-~ 22 ~-

11. Asa result of the ialse impressions caused by the
visual cues, the captain disregarded the first officar&#x27;s
reports of increasing sink rates, (b) Probable Cause

The National Transportation Safety Board determines the
probable cause of the accident was that the pilot did not recognize the
need to correct an excessive rate of descent after the aircraft had passed
decision height. This occurred despite two verbal reporte of increaring
sink rate by the first officer. The capta disregarded the reports of the
first officer, possibly because of the influence of a visual illusion caused
by the refraction of light through the heavy rain on the windshield. The
excassive rate of descent was initiated by a wind shear condition which
existed in the lower levels of the approach path and a glide slope that
tended toward the lower signal limit. 3. RECOMMENDATIONS

The Safety Board reiterates its previous Safety Recommendation A-74-55, dated July 10, 1974. (See Appendix H and I. )

&quot;The Safety Board believes the VASI can be of a valuable
supplement to any ILS approach, even under minimum weather
conditions, and therefore recommends that the Federal Aviation
Administration:

&quot;Continue to install VASI&#x27;s on all ILS runways,
but with the first priority being assigned to
runways where the glide slope is unusable Letow
DH and to those runways used by air carrier
aircraft,&quot;

asked an inspector to commend another pilot for having decided to land a helicopter 
off-site to avoid continuing a tour in deteriorating visibility. 
 
40 It is not known to what degree camera settings or features (such as automatic exposure 
adjustments in response to changing lighting conditions) and water on the camera lens may have 
affected the accuracy of the imagery’s depiction the visibility conditions encountered. However, the 
Company 2 pilot’s decision to descend and reverse course in the areas north of Waimea Canyon and 
Lua Reservoir (some of which have a minimum altitude of 1,500 ft agl) suggest that he encountered 
significantly degraded visibility. Aviation Investigation Report 
NTSB/AIR-22-05

However, one pilot also thought that the accident pilot, due to his high level of 
expertise, sometimes flew closer to adverse weather than more novice or more 
conservative pilots did. This pilot said the accident pilot was a skilled veteran who 
knew what he was doing, knew his own limitations, and was “capable of getting 
through higher tolerance areas without really getting himself dangerously into them.” 
This pilot said he had seen the accident pilot “manage things that [were] pretty tight” 
and “avoid things that were riskily…tight.” 
As discussed in section 2.1, there was no evidence that any medical condition, 
fatigue, or company pressures influenced the accident pilot’s decision to continue the 
flight into reduced visibility conditions rather than divert the tour. Considering the 
absence of such influences, as well as the accident pilot’s experience level and 
reported aversion to taking weather-related risks during tours, his continuation of the 
accident flight suggests that he had difficulty assessing the weather conditions in 
flight or that he had an optimistic belief in his own ability to fly safely through areas of 
reduced visibility. Such possibilities are consistent with psychological studies of pilots’ 
weather-related decision-making (discussed in section 2.3.1 below), which found that 
an inadequate weather assessment or risk perception biases can influence pilots to 
continue flights into deteriorating weather conditions. 
2.3.1 Weather Assessment and Risk Perception Biases 
Psychologists who study expert decision-making under conditions of 
uncertainty in real-world settings have found that such decisions typically involve two 
processes: situation assessment and action selection (Klein 2008, Orasanu, Martin, 
and Davidson 2001). The quality of available information also plays a role in the 
action selection stage of expert decision-making. Decision-makers employ mental 
simulation (the formation of a mental model) to choose an appropriate response 
strategy when faced with complex, uncertain situations. The formation of an accurate 
mental model depends on accurate information (Klein 2008). 
Because there were no weather observation sources on the north side of 
Waimea Canyon that covered areas north of the canyon to the Nāpali Coast, the 
accident pilot could not have checked the conditions there before departure. While 
his flight was in Waimea Canyon and encountered deteriorating weather at the north 
end, he would have been unable to see the weather conditions north of the canyon 
until his tour exited the canyon over the west rim.</div>

Upon exiting the canyon, the accident pilot may have optimistically thought 
that any encounter with poor visibility along the high elevation canyon rim would be 
brief and that conditions would improve as the flight continued toward the Nāpali 
Coast, where he could descend the helicopter over the terrain downslope, increasing 
the flight’s clearance below the clouds. However, due to the atypical weather pattern 
on the day of the accident, such a supposition would have been incorrect because 
some of the clouds moving in from the northwest were very low, extending to the 
ground as fog in some areas as they moved over the terrain on the northwest side of 
the island. Thus, the accident pilot’s decision to continue the flight into an area of 
deteriorating weather at the north end of Waimea Canyon and then continue farther 
north of the canyon may have resulted from a lack of relevant preflight weather 
information, which hindered his ability to develop an accurate mental model of the 
atypical weather situation. Research on pilots’ weather assessments has shown that some pilots may also 
continue visual flight into adverse weather conditions due to deficiencies in situation 
assessment. That is, they do not adequately recognize when the conditions that they 
can see in front of them have deteriorated to the point that they are unsafe. One 
simulator study found that only 10 out of 32 VFR pilots made a timely decision to 
divert their flights when they encountered IMC. Further, pilots in the study varied 
substantially in their estimates of ceiling height and visibility (and tended to 
overestimate both), and those who continued the flights made less accurate (higher) 
estimate of visibility than those who diverted (Goh and Wiegmann 2001). Another 
study that presented pilots with videos of in-flight weather conditions found that their 
assessments of the conditions were inaccurate and overly optimistic (Coyne et al. 
2008). Thus, it is possible that the accident pilot’s decision to continue the VFR flight 
into deteriorating weather was influenced, in part, by an inaccurate in-flight 
assessment of the weather conditions. Another possibility is that the pilot accurately assessed the conditions but still 
chose to fly into an area of deteriorating weather, which would indicate a deficiency 
in the action selection stage of decision-making.</div>

Waimea Canyon before taking action to divert, and he subsequently entered areas of 
visible moisture along the Nāpali Coast after approaching it from the east. Onboard 
video from the Company 1 and Company 2 helicopters showed that, when these 
helicopters reached the north shore, areas of clearer weather (for example, east of 
Hanalei Bay) were available for them to continue east along a clockwise tour around 
the island, but they instead flew west. If such continuation of flights into reduced visibility weather conditions were 
indicative of routine noncompliance in everyday decision-making, then such routine 
noncompliance could have led to a redefinition of “acceptable” weather conditions 
among these pilots that was inconsistent with FAA requirements. This could explain 
how an experienced pilot who was not widely regarded as a risk-taker could find it

acceptable to continue a flight into below-minimum weather conditions, however 
brief he may have expected this encounter to be. In summary, factors relevant to the accident pilot’s decision to continue the 
VFR flight into deteriorating weather conditions include a lack of relevant weather 
information, an atypical weather pattern, and the possibilities that he inadequately 
assessed the weather in-flight, was overconfident in his abilities, or could have been 
influenced by a drift toward risky operating practices among air tour pilots operating 
on the island of Kauai. However, due to conflicting or insufficient evidence, it is 
difficult to assess the role or the relative importance of the various possible weather 
assessment and risk perception bias considerations.41 
Thus, the NTSB concludes that the pilot’s decision to continue the flight into 
deteriorating visibility was likely influenced by a lack of relevant weather information 
and an atypical weather pattern and may have been influenced by the possibilities 
that he inadequately assessed the weather conditions in flight or was overconfident in 
his abilities. The NTSB further concludes that, considering that at least three other 
tour flights entered reduced visibility conditions on the day of the accident, it is 
possible that procedural drift toward risky weather-related operating practices 
existed among pilots of the local air tour community. 
2.3.2 Lack of Effective Cue-Based Weather Training 
The NTSB has long advocated for the FAA to develop and require cue-based 
weather training for Hawaii air tour pilots to assist them in their ability to accurately 
assess hazardous local weather conditions and make appropriate in-flight 
weather-related decisions. Such training, if offered on a recurrent basis, may help 
prevent procedural drift and normalization of deviance among pilots by periodically 
recalibrating their perceptions of what constitutes acceptable weather. We first expressed our interest in cue-based weather training in 2007 in our 
report on another helicopter air tour accident involving VFR flight into IMC on Kauai.</div>

vacuum-operated deicing boots on the leading edges of the airfoils would
be able to remove only that ice immediately adjacent to and on the boot,
leaving a large area of the airfoils subject to ice accretion, This la.ter
ice could only be removed by operating the aircraft in an area where
the ambient temperature would melt the ice. In view of che abovo, the Safety Board concludes that the most
likely reason for the inability to climb to a higher altitude was an
accretion of ice which increased the aircraft&#x27;s gross weight and decreased thw lifting efficiency of the airfoils,

The pilot, accompanied by his wife and five children, was
returning to his hoine in Michigan, He received a personal weather
brieting it the flight service station at Savannah. Although no record
of the contents of the briefing was made, routine briefings normally
include information from the current surface weather chart, terminal
sequence reports, SIGMETS and AIRMETS, radar summary reports,
and winds aloft reports--all of these data were available to the briefer
and to the pilot. From the weather information that was available to the pilot,
he should have known that moderate-to.-severe icing was forecasted
for part of his intended route. In addition, he should have known that
the owner&#x27;s manual advised pilots tc avoid known icing conditions when -
ever possible. The pilot&#x27;s radio communicctions through various stages uf
‘the flight indicated that he was concerned about the avoidance of
thunderstorm3, about icing conditions, about the erratic operation of
one of the engines, and about his occasional inability to receive VOR
stations. Nevertneless, the pilot continued on his preplanned flight
and at 1911:20, following a series of radio communicetions with ATC
about icing, about the aircraft&#x27;s climb performance, anc about vibrations,
he requested ATC assistance to get to an airport. The controller recognized the need for assistance and began to
collect airport end weather information to provide priority service to
the distressed pilot. Although the pilot did not, on this occasion, declare an emergency, the controllers treated the situation as an emergency and initiated actions to orovide priority hanaling for the flight. The controller did not, nor was he required to, notify the pilot that
the flight was receiving priority handling. Possibly, had the controller
told the pilot that he was considered to be an emergency and had ne requested specifically the pilot&#x27;s desire, the pilot might have been able
to participate more actively in planning a course of action. The controller interpreted the pilot&#x27;s transmission at 1911:35

2. There is no evidence of a preimpact malfunction of

relatively high power when the aircraft struck the

3, The flight operated in conditions conducive to airframe and induction icing for about 46 minutes.

4. The Safety Board coule not determine if the installed
deicing equipment was used or if the equipment was
used properly,

5. The pilot planned, initiated, and continued a night

6. The communications difficulties experienced by the
pilot probably resulted from a combination of ice
accretion on the aircraft radio antennas and terrain
interference at the lower flight altitudes.

7. The pilot&#x27;s ability to make a decision was degraded
by the stress cf the numereus problerns he encountered,

&amp; While the air traffic control personnel provided
assistance to the pilot in accordance with their under -
standing of the established prcecedures, the controllers
failed to seek specific information regarding the degrees
of deterioration of the pilot&#x27;s and the aircraft&#x27;s abilities
to deal with the adverse conditions. (b) Probable Cause

The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the
probable cause of the acciden: was a controlled collision with the terrain,
while the flight was receiving radar vectors in night IMC conditions,
because structural icing prevented the pilot from climbing to a safe
altitude. Contributing to the accident were the pilot&#x27;s failure to appreciate the severity ci the weather he could expect to encounter and to take
the initiative to divert the flight vefore his options were reduced, and the
controllers&#x27; failures to take more timely and forceful action to seek more
specific infermation regarding the degree of deterioration of the pilot&#x27;s
and aircraft&#x27;s ability to deal with the adverse conditions.

3, RECOMMENDATIONS

The Safety Board recommends that pilots and controllers study
the circumstancas of this accident and decide how they could have r2sponded to the conditions involved in this flight in a way that would have
prevented the accident. Pilots, as certificated airmen, must understand the importance
of a thorough preflight weather analysis, particularly with respect to
forecasted and known icing conditions or other severe weather along the
intended route of flight, Pilots should know and heed the precautions
and operating limitations set forth in the airplane owner&#x27;s manual,
aircraft operating manual, and other approved operating instructions. Pilots should plan their flights with regard to those precautions and
operating limitations and avoid encounters with icing or other severe
weather. Pilots should be conservative in their decisions to exercise
the privileges of their airman&#x27;s certificutes and consider their level of
experience, recency of experience, the aircraft&#x27;s capability, and pilot
workload before committing themselves to a flight. It is extremely
important that pilot&#x27;s carefully weigh the need to complete the flight

against the potential hazards of attempting the flight.</div>

believes that, in view of the pilot&#x27;s experience, he should have famiiiarized

-~ 2] -

After initiating the flight and after experiencing difficulty with
the right engine shortly after takeoff, the pilot should have landed at
the nearest suitable airport, particularly ir. view of the adverse weather. After proceeding to the point where flight became perilous -- unable to
climb in icing conditions -- the pilot should have communicated clearly
and emphatically that he was in distress an thereafter requested specific
assistance based on a previously acquired knowledge of the facilities
available to him in the area where the emergency occurred. The Safety Board believes that the pilot&#x27;s motivation to return
to his home may have affected his decision to continue the flight, as
Planned, after his first emergescy in the Savannah area and again when
he encountered the problems he reported to the Indianapolis controller. In the latter situation, a more prudent pilot would have altered his route
of flight, in coordination with ATC, to avoid the icing conditions. The Safet:- Board believes that when an emergency develops in
night IFR conditions, a prudent pilot should be prepared to ask the controller to vector the flight to: (1) The nearest VFR airport; (2) an IFR
airport with the best available weather, or (3) an IFR airport with
precision approach facilities. Since this pilot apparently was not aware
of his position relative to well equipped airports along his route, his
immediate reaction was to ask the controller to lead hirn to an unspecified
airport,

After the flight began its diversion to Lonesome Pine, the Safety
Buird believes thet a key factor which influenced the piJot&#x27;s decision to
miake the approach to Lonesome Pine airport was an assumption that the
weather conditions at that airport would be similar to the conditions reported at Tri-City Airport. The Safety Board does not criticize the pilot&#x27;s decision to execute
an approach to Lonesome Pine Airport if he believed that he was losing
control of the aircraft and could not risk continued flight beyond Lonesome
Pine. 2.2 Conclusions (a) Findings

disorientation, which could lead to loss of control and/or a controlled flight into terrain accident. Had the pilot performed an interim risk assessment and considered the external circumstances or 
discussed them with the spotter,107 the NMSP dispatcher, or SAR ground personnel, he would 
have been more likely to recognize the potential hazards associated with an immediate takeoff 
and might have delayed his departure from the remote landing site until more favorable 
conditions prevailed. The NTSB concludes that the pilot exhibited poor decision-making when 
he chose to take off from a relatively secure landing site at night and attempt VFR flight in

actors Affecting the Pilot’s Decision-Making 
This section addresses factors that could have influenced the pilot’s decision-making both 
before accepting the mission and when he took off from the mountain to return to SAF, including 
fatigue, self-induced pressure, and situational stress. The NTSB considered whether environmental and/or physiological factors related to the 
cold temperature or the high altitude might have degraded the pilot’s decision-making in this 
case. The pilot spent about 50 minutes searching for the hiker and carrying her up a steep slope 
in very cold, windy conditions, in freezing precipitation, while dressed only in an unlined 
summer-weight flight suit and undergarments. Although cold stress can degrade cognitive 
performance, especially for tasks that a
re at the U.S. Army Research Institute for Environmental Medicine indicated that, based 
on the pilot’s level of exertion and the terrain, the pilot’s metabolic rate would likely have been 
fairly high, offsetting the cold weather’s effects and minimizing the risk of hypothermia. After 
reviewing the circumstances of this accident for evidence of any physiological effects from the 
high altitude (the pilot was operating in the unpressurized helicopter for more than 2 hours 
before the accident), U.S. Army Research Institute for Environmental Medicine personnel 
indicated that the altitude would have affected the pilot very little as well. Because the pilot lived 
at an altitude of about 6,000 feet, he would likely have been sufficiently acclimatized to operate 
at higher altitudes.109 Since the time at altitude was relatively short (about 3 hours), there was 
likely little hypoxic effect on the pilot’s cognitive function. 
 
107 The SAR commander spoke with the spotter while the pilot was retrieving the hiker and urged the spotter to 
remain in place and wait for ground teams to arrive if it was not safe to take off. However, it is not clear that the

Although the dispatcher suggested that the spotter retrieve the lost hiker, the pilot, who was slightly more

106 In this regard, the pilot’s decision-making performance during the accident mission is reminiscent of a 
category of decision-making error that researchers have labeled “plan continuation error.” Plan continuation error 
has been defined as “failure to revise a flight plan despite emerging evidence that suggests it is no longer safe.”

helicopter was airborne within about 9 minutes of the pilot’s return indicates that the pilot was 
still fixated on departing as soon as possible, and he did not spend much time considering 
alternative courses of action.106 
Taking off in a helicopter in dark (moonless) lighting conditions, with marginal visibility, 
strong wind, turbulence, low clouds, the potential for structural and/or engine icing conditions, 
and surrounded by high terrain poses an unacceptably high risk of spatial and/or geographic

Although the dispatcher suggested that the spotter retrieve the lost hiker, the pilot, who was slightly more 
ately clothed for the conditions, hiked to retrieve her. 
106 In this regard, the pilot’s decision-making performance during the accident mission is reminiscent of a 
category of decision-making error that researchers have labeled “plan continuation error.” Plan continuation error 
has been defined as “failure to revise a flight plan despite emerging evidence that suggests it is no longer safe.”

being conducted at night was further reason for the entire checklist to be followed. The
checklist callouts were a backup to the flightcrew to confirm their observations of the
position of the airplane at times during the instrument approach, and as a result, were not
items which should have been arbitrarily discounted. Although the absence of the callouts
does not appear to have had an influence on subsequent events, a reminder to the captain
that the airplane was below DH might have influenced his subsequent decisionmaking
process. Further, although the deviations from the approved checklist did not contribute
to the accident, they indicate a lack of discipline which is not professional. 3. CONCLUSIONS Findings

1. There was no evidence of preim; “t structural failure, fire, or flight
control or powerplant malfunction.

2. The flightcrew did not accomplish all checklist items which related to
altitude awareness; however, members of the flightcrew did monitor the
altitude of the airplane and the flight instruments during the final
approach. The deviations from the checklist did not contribute to the accident. The instrument approach was stable and uneventful until the airplane
passed decision height.

The general weather forecast was substantially correct; however, the ~ }}

localized weather encountered by Flight 576 while on final approach was
much worse than was reported on the Airport Terminal Information
Service. Air traffic control (ATC) personnel at the Raleigh-Durham ATC facility
Were not aware of the rapidly deteriorating weather conditions in time
to warn the flightcrew. About 1957, heavy rain moved across the airport toward the approach
Course to runway 23. The weather conditions changed rapidly after Flight 576 passed decision
height. The airplane encountered an unexpectedly heavy rain with associated
downdrafts and horizontal wind shear about 100 feet above the ground. The magnitude of the downdrafts and wind shear could not be determined
from the available information. The rainfall rate may have been as high as 7 inches per hour when
Flight 576 encountered the heavy rain. The captain observed the descent below glide Slope caused by the initial
encounter with the heavy rain and responded by adding thrust. The flighterew lost forward visibility rapidly when the airplane entered
the heavy rain. The captain was not aware of the magnitude of the downdrafts and
horizontal wind shear, with the result that he initially applied the thrist
he believed necessary to maintain the glide Slope. The rate of descent increased rapidly after the airplane encountered the
heavy rain despite the addition of thrust and the upward rotation of the
airplane by the captain. The captain had less than 6 seconds to correct the airplane&#x27;s flightpath if
he was to avoid the airplane hitting the ground. There was insufficient time for the captain to react and the airplane to
respond to prevent the airplane from striking the ground after the
encounter with the heavy rain when the airplane was less than 100 feet
above the ground.</div>

officer stated, “why don’t (they) just get us to the field?” These statements and those made 
earlier in the flight indicate that the pilots were impatient to land. Although no apparent reason 
existed for the pilots to feel rushed (for example, they landed 9 minutes ahead of schedule and no 
evidence was found that the passengers or the company were placing undue pressure on the 
pilots to land early on the day of the accident), they repeatedly expressed impatience with ATC 
and the weather radar displays. During postaccident interviews, other company pilots did not 
indicate that East Coast Jets pressured them to rush to get to the destination airport. The captain’s impatience during the flight was contrary to descriptions of his flying 
provided by other company pilots who described him as a serious and meticulous pilot. Specifically, the pilots described instances in which the captain carefully monitored weather 
during a flight and altered landing plans despite pressure from passengers.111 The captain could 
have reasonably opted to hold, divert, or attempt to land on runway 12 with a headwind. However, the captain’s focus on completing the flight degraded his attention to the changing 
weather situation and prevented him from recognizing that alternatives to landing on runway 30 
were available. At 0938:50, the captain stated that the Approach checklist was complete, and, 1 second 
later, the first officer responded, “approaches are done,” even though he had been interrupted 
about 2 minutes 24 seconds before making this statement and had not completed the checklist. 
 
111 One pilot described a flight with the accident captain in which a high-ranking official was a passenger. The 
flight was scheduled to land at Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Although the weather forecast was legal for IFR conditions, it 
was marginal. According to the pilot, the captain called FSSs repeatedly during the trip, determined that the weather 
was deteriorating, and decided to divert to the next scheduled stop at Des Moines, Iowa. The captain maintained his 
decision even though the travel arranger, who was also a passenger, came up to the cockpit, indicated that the 
high-ranking official was unhappy with the decision, and tried to talk the pilots into landing at Cedar Rapids despite 
the weather. NTSB

Further, as the PM, the first officer should have verified that the checklist was complete, not the 
captain. At 0939:16, the CVR recorded the first officer trying to contact the FBO for 
nonessential reasons, such as asking about how to get fuel upon landing, with the captain’s 
approval at a time when he should have been completing the Approach checklist and monitoring 
the flight instruments. These calls were further interrupted by more critical communications with 
the captain, radio calls, and ATC and were not in accordance with 14 CFR 135.100, the “sterile 
cockpit rule,” which states that pilots may not make nonsafety-related radio calls during flight 
below 10,000 feet.</div>

been influenced by a cognitive bias. Deviating east toward the coastline would have
required the pilot to disappoint his passengers by eliminating the last major scenic area on
his tour and would have resulted in a late return to the airport. These outcomes represented
certain inconveniences for the pilot. However, the pilot had the option of avoiding these
inconveniences by continuing along his usual flightpath adjacent to the Kahili Ridge and
attempting to cross the ridge at the high pass. Although the pilot may have recognized the
increased safety risk associated with this option, the decision to accept a riskier choice to
avoid a certain set of inconveniences would be consistent with a human decision bias that
is often observed when people weigh potential decision outcomes in terms of the potential
losses associated with each choice.92 Although it is possible that the pilot’s decision was
influenced by overconfidence or decision-making bias, the extent to which either of these
factors might have influenced his decision to continue flying into the area of deteriorating
weather could not be determined.
2.3.2.3 Bali Hai’s Pilot-Scheduling Practices
Bali Hai’s pilots remained at the helicopters’ flight controls nearly continuously
for up to 8 hours per day because of the company practice of keeping the helicopters
running between tour flights. The pilots did not have scheduled breaks, and they ate lunch
while sitting in the helicopter between tours, if at all. There was no shelter at Bali Hai’s
staging area, nor were there any restroom facilities. The lack of scheduled breaks, the
short turnaround times between flights, and the unavailability of private restroom facilities
probably discouraged consumption of food and liquids during the workday because there

was little opportunity to go to the bathroom. This increased the risk of dehydration and
other physiological problems, which could have degraded performance. These working conditions were also conducive to fatigue. Research on pilot
fatigue in a noisy, vibrating helicopter simulator found considerable increases in
subjective fatigue after 6 hours of short repetitive flights. At the end of this period, some
helicopter pilots who participated in the study said they were so fatigued that they did not
feel safe to fly a real helicopter. As subjective fatigue increased, study pilots demonstrated
increasingly frequent “lapses” in performance. The study also found that routine, hourly
rest breaks outside the cockpit reduced the buildup of pilot fatigue to manageable levels,
even when flight periods were extended to 8 hours.93

tour flights. The experienced pilots indicated that a pilot’s skill in assessing changing
weather conditions and anticipating the effect of any changes on flying conditions was
critical for effective decision-making. They stated that such skills improved as local flying
experience increased. This raises concern about the impact of local inexperience on the
safety of pilot decision-making. A review of the eight weather-related air tour accidents
that have occurred in Hawaii since SFAR 71’s implementation revealed that four of the
accidents involved pilots who had relatively low experience flying air tours in Hawaii. In
fact, three of the accidents involved pilots who had flown there for less than 2 months. It is highly unlikely that the accident pilot would have decided to continue into the
area of deteriorating weather conditions and attempted to cross in the vicinity of the
accident site if he had accurately assessed the changing weather and had appreciated how
it would likely affect flight visibility in those areas. Therefore, the pilot’s decision to fly in
the vicinity of the accident site indicates that he was unable to accurately assess how
rapidly or to what extent the weather was deteriorating in that area. As described earlier in
this report, the pilot had previously told a passenger that he had flown through thin clouds
during a ridge crossing because he could see through the clouds. The pilot may have
expected that this would be the case during the accident flight; however, visibility was
dramatically reduced along the top of the ridge as the incoming line of weather reached
the high terrain. The Safety Board concludes that the pilot’s inexperience with Hawaii weather
conditions affected his ability to make appropriate in-flight decisions when faced with
deteriorating weather.</div>

Aircraft Accident Report
have a source of precision vertical guidance and provided little advantage over the
originally selected runway suggests that the captain’s decision-making may have been
degraded. Additionally, although CVR evidence revealed instances in which the captain
appeared to be monitoring the first officer’s performance, the captain declared the
approach “stable” when the airplane descended through 500 feet, despite the airplane’s
excessive descent rate and reduced engine power settings. Most significantly, the captain
failed to observe and respond to the four red PAPI lights that were displayed throughout
most of the final approach. Any one of these items should have prompted the captain to
call for a go-around. Many of the small errors made by the captain and his deficient performance during
the approach to TLH were consistent with fatigue. Research and previous accident
investigation experience indicate that fatigue can cause pilots to fixate on one aspect of a
situation and not respond effectively to warnings from other aspects, such as a stickshaker,
GPWS, or visual warnings. Further, one of the common deficiencies observed in
fatigue-related accidents is a tendency to continue an approach despite indications that the
approach should be discontinued. This fatigue-related performance inertia is evidenced by
decision-making and monitoring deficiencies. The Safety Board notes that during the
accident approach, there was not much evidence of substantive evaluation or discussion of
the consequences of the decision to change the landing runway to runway 9. For an
experienced captain to support a decision to change landing runways (when it
substantially increased cockpit workload late in the approach and removed a potentially
critical source of glideslope guidance) suggests degraded decision-making consistent with
the effects of fatigue.112
Therefore, on the basis of the early hour of the accident, the captain’s sleep history,
and his performance deficiencies recorded by the CVR, the Safety Board concludes that
the captain was likely impaired by fatigue and this impairment contributed to his degraded
performance (especially in the areas of crew coordination and monitoring) during the
approach to TLH.
2.3.2 Role of Fatigue—First Officer
The Safety Board’s review of crew interviews and the first officer’s sleep history
revealed that he reported having difficulty adjusting his sleep cycle to the reserve-duty
schedule. The first officer told investigators that this was the first reserve schedule he had
flown in several years and that it was difficult on his body because the sleep-wake cycle
was frequently changing between day and night sleeping schedules.</div>

his fuel reserve of about 1 hour. Considering the thunderstorm activity
affecting the New York City area, including his alternate airport,
LaGuardia, his fuel reserve would have been minimal. It is uncertain when the captain of Eastern 66 made his final decision to continue the approach. He apparently had not made a final
determination when the flight was 5 miles from the OM and was cleared
for the approach because he told the final vector controller, &quot;...we&#x27;ll
let you know about conditions.&#x27;&#x27; Also, about a minute later, he explained to the first officer, &#x27;I have the radar on standby in case I need
it...&#x27;&#x27;, which suggests he was thinking about the possibility of either
not making the approach or having to abandon it. However, because
pilots commonly rely on the degree of successes achieved by pilots of
preceding flights when they are confronted with common hazards, it
is likely that he continued the approach pending receipt of information
on the progress of the two flights which were immediately ahead of
him. By the time the second of these two flights had landed without
reported difficulty, the captain of Eastern 66 was apparently committed to the approach, which discloses the hazards of a reliance on
the success of pilots of preceding flights when dynamic and severe
weather conditions exist. Within minutes, flight conditions can change
drastically in or near mature thunderstorms. Moreover, pilot and
controller workloads, and communication frequency congestion, can
acau vo uilussions and assumptions, and confusion about who is aware
of what.

eed

In summary, the accident involving Eastern 66 and the nearaccidents involving Flying Tiger 161 and Eastern 902 were the results
of an underestimation of the significance of relatively severe and
dynamic weather conditions in a high density terminal area by all
parties involved in the movement of air traffic in the airspace system. The Safety Board, therefore, believes that no useful purpose would be
served by dwelling critically on individual actions or judgments within
the system, but that the actions and judgments required to correct and
improve the system should be reviewed. All parts of the system must
recognize the serious hazards that are associated with thunderstorms
in terminal areas. A better means of providing pilots with more &gt;
timely weather information must be designed. Air traffic controllers and their supervisors must closely follow
the development and movement of severe weather conditions by gathering,
assimilating, and disseminating information from all sources--radar,
visual, pilot reports, and weather reports--so that appropriate action
can be planned before air safety is threatened. ATC must recognize
that thunderstorms and other dynamic weather conditions which develop
within, or move into, terminal areas may seriously disrupt the safe
flow of traffic. When these conditions appear likely, ATC must be
capable of adjusting the flow of traffic into terminal areas so that timely
actions and rational judgments in the interest of air safety are primary
to moving the traffic. Pilots must exercise more independent judgments when they are
confronted with severe weather conditions in the terminal areas.</div>

concludes that the pilot experienced spatial disorientation while climbing the helicopter in IMC, 
which led to his loss of helicopter control and the resulting collision with terrain. 
 
57 Although the pilot did not declare an emergency, the controller’s actions to identify and provide service to the 
accident flight were nearly identical to the initial actions specified for responding to an emergency. ATC procedures 
for responding to a pilot-declared emergency specify, in part, that the controller obtain the minimum information 
required to provide assistance, including the aircraft identification and type, nature of the emergency, and the pilot’s 
desires (FAA 2019b, 10-2-1). These minimum information criteria are nearly identical to the information the controller 
requested from the accident pilot. 
58 Even though the pilot was familiar with the flight deck layout, to perform the task of pushing the IDENT 
button, he needed to direct his gaze, likely accompanied by head movement, to the center panel where the button was 
located. He also needed to remove his left hand from the helicopter’s collective control to reach toward the center 
panel to push the IDENT button while his right hand remained on the cyclic control. 
59 When an aircraft accelerates, the pilot’s vestibular system will detect the linear acceleration and lead to the 
incorrect perception that aircraft is climbing when it is not. Also, the forces the pilot experiences when the aircraft is 
in a turn can also give the illusion that the aircraft is climbing (SKYbrary 2020).

2.3 Influences on Pilot’s Decision to Continue Flight into Adverse 
Weather 
As discussed in section 2.1, there was no evidence to suggest that Island Express, the air 
charter broker, or the client placed any pressure on the accident pilot to accept the charter flight 
request or complete the flight in adverse weather. However, a number of factors were present that 
may have influenced the pilot to place pressure on himself (self-induced pressure) to complete the 
flight. For example, the accident pilot was the client’s preferred pilot, whom the client trusted to 
fly his children. Also, the air charter broker used Island Express exclusively for the accident 
client’s local helicopter transport needs because Island Express was the only operator that met the 
air charter broker’s standards for the client, and the client reportedly appreciated the relationship 
between the two companies. The accident pilot likely took pride in these positions of trust both 
with the client directly and within Island Express. Further, the pilot’s relationship with the client 
was friendly, and he likely did not want to disappoint the client by not completing the flight. In addition, before the accident flight departed, the pilot had discussed with the air charter 
broker’s owner his plan to fly the route around BUR and VNY before joining US 101 to fly west 
to CMA. However, as described in section 2.2.1, the pilot did not complete an updated flight risk 
analysis form, which would have required him to list an alternative plan based on the weather 
information available at the time of departure.</div>

provided the first officer also looked at the captain&#x27;s altimeter during
this critical portion of the approach. Thus, two factors are present in this case, either of which I
could have been the sole reason for the flight to descend too low while I
turning toward the final portion of the circling approach. The Board j
believes that both factors were involved, and that the pilot probably
received inaccurate altitude information from the illusions associated with
darkness, as well as from a faulty altimeter. The degree of contribution
of each factor cannot be fully determined. However, considering that a ,
pilot must receive altitude information from an altimeter during a circling (
approach, then any illusion received by the pilot from visual cues, which ‘
would cause him to believe that he was at a safe altitude, would be even
more acceptable when supported by an altimeter reading which, unbeknown to
him, was erroneous. 2.2 Conclusions
(a) Findings : I
1. The aircraft was properly certificated and airworthy with

the exception of the captain&#x27;s altimeter, which was not

airworthy.

2. The flight crewmembers were properly certificated and current ‘
with their requirements. -

3. There was no malfunction of the aircraft prior to the
accident except that the captain&#x27;s altimeter could have been
indicating erroneously as much as 250 feet too high.

4. The weather conditions were adequate for a circling approach
to Runway 5, under the existing regulations. However, I
scattered clouds at 400 feet could have caused the pilot to
extend his flightpath outside the circling area.

1Q

5. None of the Emmet County Airport runways was equipped
with visual approach aids, such as VASI or VAPI, or
approach Lights except for REIL&#x27;s on Runway 23 and 32. The runways are equipped with medium-intensity runway
lights.

6. The approach area to Runway 5 contained few, if any,
visual cues to assist in determining vertical and
horizontal positions during a night circling approach.

7. An altimeter malfunction, illusions because of the lack
of visual cues at night, or a combination of both could
have resulted in the pilot&#x27;s being unaware of his dangerously low position during his approach. (b) Probable Cause

The Board determines the probable cause of this accident to be
illusions produced by the lack of visual cues during a circling
approach over unlighted terrain at night to a runway not equipped
with approach lights or other visual approach aids. These illusions,
which made the pilot think that he was higher than his true position,
were made more acceptable to him because of a strong possibility of
an erroneously high indication on his altimeter. BY THE NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD:

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS AND CONCLUSIONS &gt; ANALYSIS] The Board believes that the illusions caused by the darkness
and lack of visual cues in the area of the circling approach were such
that the pilot could not determine his altitude accurately enough by use
of visual cues solely. Use of the altimeter is a necessity in such circumstances. The course taken by the pilot, after departing the inbound course
from the VOR, took him over terrain higher than that at the accident site. Therefore, a descent had to have been initiated. This could have occurred ©
after he began his turn back to an easterly heading, towards the final
portion of the approach. If the pilot elected to proceed visually from
this point on, he could have believed that he was higher than he really
was. With the runway in sight, the first officer may not have been calling
or observing the altitude. The aircraft, prior to beginning the descent
&#x27; from the circling approach, could have been at any altitude between the
600 feet minimum and 800 feet, the height of the measured ceiling. It is
not known which altimeter the first officer was watching, but since the
circling approach was to the left, it would have been likely for the first
officer to have been looking out the left side of the cockpit toward the
airport at times, while monitoring the instruments. In such a case, he
may have been obtaining his altitude information from the captain&#x27;s
altimeter.

(2) The Captain&#x27;s Altimeter and Night Illusions

On a 2.5° glidepath, an aircraft would be at an altitude of
230 feet above the runway when 1 mile from the touchdown point. On a 2°
glidepath, the altitude above the runway would be 184 feet at the same

y

distance. N434EJ first struck trees at ‘an altitude of 886 feet, or 166
feet above the elevation of the airport. Although, as pointed out earlier,
the illusions at night due to lack of visual cues could lead the pilot to
believe that he was higher than he actually was. However, it must be
considered that the pilot may have known his location and was determining
his vertical position, during the approach, from his altimeter. For the
sake of this argument, lack of visual cues for altitude determination must
be considered to have had little effect. In such a situation, a pilot
would not have flown at an altitude of 166 feet above the runway elevation
on a heading of approximately 50° from the runway heading so far from the
threshold, since this would require a turn toward the runway at a dangerously low altitude, particularly at night. . However, an altimeter which
read too high could have caused the pilot to have believed that he was
sufficiently high so as to safely traverse the area. In view of the condition of the captain&#x27;s altimeter, such a situation is highly possible,
provided the first officer also looked at the captain&#x27;s altimeter during
this critical portion of the approach.

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS AND CONCLUSIONS &gt; ANALYSIS] This philosophy follows the TERPs
criteria in determining the circling approach area. Attachment No. 2
illustrates this area around the Emmet County Airport, and shows that 300
or more feet obstruction clearance is provided. N434EJ flew outside the
area while proceeding west during the circling approach, and was outside
the area when initial contact with the trees was made. The reasons for the flight&#x27;s leaving the area are not known. It is quite possible, for example, that the scattered clouds may have
caused the captain to extend his flightpath. The FSS specialist stated
that at times the aircraft disappeared as the flight went in and out of
scud. No doubt this was due to the scattered clouds at 400 feet. However,
in view of the FSS specialist&#x27;s location, the aircraft might have disappeared
behind the clouds, and not have gone in and out of them. Another reason
is the difficulty in determining the 1.7-mile limit. In most cases, this
would be a difficult task in the daytime, much less at night. The lack of
visual cues at night can cause a pilot to think that he is closer to the
runway and higher than he really is.. The hazards of night approaches over
areas lacking visual cues are well known, and have been publicized. One

authority states, &quot;Under conditions of haze, smoke, dust, glare, or
darkness, expect to be higher than you are.&quot; 6/ He also states that
shadows are a key factor in depth perception, and that their absence, when
due to visibility restrictions, unknowingly confuses the pilot. Under
such conditions, the pilot interprets his altitude as being higher than

it actually is. &quot;This effect is also encountered during night (especially
blackout) landings.&#x27;&quot;&#x27; Captain Prosper Cocquyt explains in his paper,
&quot;Sensory Illusions,&quot; that a pilot determines his relative height by estimation of the distance to landmarks and the angle between the direction

of observation of the landmarks and his horizon. This angle is usually
positive, as the landmarks are usually observed below his horizon. When
the pilot&#x27;s observation of his horizon is not the true horizon,. then the
angle becomes the original angle plus the included angle between the true
and imagined horizon. Cocquyt states that when imaginary heights are
positive, the pilot has the sensation of flying higher than his true height. Imaginary ground is above the actual ground beyond the landmarks. Thus in
the case of night flying, the pilot may see stars below his imaginary
horizon and mistake them for ground lights. A serious hazard arises if an
optical illusion, resulting in an imaginary height, persists during the
course of the landing procedure. The Board believes that the illusions caused by the darkness
and lack of visual cues in the area of the circling approach were such
that the pilot could not determine his altitude accurately enough by use
of visual cues solely. Use of the altimeter is a necessity in such circumstances. The course taken by the pilot, after departing the inbound course
from the VOR, took him over terrain higher than that at the accident site. Therefore, a descent had to have been initiated.

2,400 feet suggests that the pilots were in control of the airplane and may have been
slowly daseending intentionally without great concern. The absence of radio calls to the
contrary supports this hypothesis. Regardless of the fact that the actual weather may have been a little worse
san reported, the Safety Board concludes that weather was a factor in the accident only
to .4e extent that it necessitated an Instrument approach.

2.6. Misinterpretation or Malfumetion of Altimeters

The altimeters installed on both sides of the instrument panel were of the
design commonly referred to as three-pointers. Three scparate pointers rotate to
indicate increments of hundreds, thousands, and ten-thousaids of feet: of altitude. Mis~setting of altimeters by the pilots is not suspected in this aecident because both
altimeters were found set very near the correct setting of 30.20. A. mechanical error in one or both altimeters aboard N339HA was not
considered a reasonable possibility since the radar data and the ATC transcript showed
that flight 1517 was cruising at 6,000 feet and, at 0959, flight 1517 was cleared for the
appreach and instrueted to eross CEROL at 5,000 feet. Radar data showed a descent to
5,000 feet and, following a break in radar coverage, it showed a return at 4,600 feet
followed by a steady descent until the last return at 2,700 feet. Therefore, the
comparisons of radar data altitude readouts match the altitudes which should have been
flown, until the descent below 3,300 feet, and do not suggest that flight 1517 expertenced
any mechanical problems with the altimeter. The Safety Board also considered the possibility that the first officer may
have misread her altimeter by 1,000 feet and that the captain may have, at the same
time, failed to monitor closely the approach. If both pilots misread and/or fatled to
monitor the altimeters, it possibly could explain the airplane&#x27;s continued descent to 2,700
feet while still in the procedure turn and before intercepting the loealizer. The ‘mpact at
2,400 feet, nearly 1,000 feet lower than the procedure turn altitude c{{ 3,300 feet, could
have occurred ff the crew thought they had not yet completed their deseant to 3,300 feet
and if they were still waiting for the localizer needle to center.</div>

understand why the captain did not detect such a gross error. Furthermore, the
considerable time which had elapsed from the initiation of the procedure vurn without
localizer interception shold have been an additional indication to the pilots, especially
the captain, that appropriate remedial action was needed. Under Federal Aviation
Regulations, being unsure of one&#x27;s position in IMC would certainly qualify as an &quot;urgency&quot;
condition, constituting an emergency and requiring timely action. Although the airplane&#x27;s
configuration at the accident site suggests that a missed approach or a climb to a
minimum safe altitude (if the flighterew knew that they were not on the localizer course)
may have been in progress at the time of impact, either on the flighterew&#x27;s initiative or at
the controller&#x27;s suggestion, this action was delayed until it was too late to avoid ground
impact.

er nny

The Safety Board believes that there are several human performance, as well
as operational factors, which coutd help to explain how such errors may have been
compounded and not detected by the pilots in sufficient time to execute a missed
approach, These factors include training to &quot;proficiency&quot; in minimum time, the
assignment of a new captain to fly with a new first officer, the limited experience of the
first officer in multiengine airplanes and in instrument flying, the effects of a &quot;noisy&quot;
cockpit (as reflected in the flight logs and as reported to her husband and roomate)
documented dissatisfaction on the part of the first officer in communicating, the lack of
an interphone system, the effect the proximity of the passengers to the cockpit had on
crew communication, Henson&#x27;s policy of providing en route and approach charts to the
captain only, and several significant stress producing events in the lives of both pilots. SA AEST QUES SAANPRORN EA EDR RMON NI OR OIA EET ER LTTE Me

The facts illustrate that this flighterew were not sufficiently prepared to
conduct safe instrument flight operations and that the management and oversight of this
commuter airline was inadequate. The Safety Board believes that the shortcomings cn the
parts of Henson management and the FAA are among the underiying reasons for this
accident.

2.9 Operntional and Humen Ferformance Elements

2.9.1 Flighterew Experience and Qualifications

The captain&#x27;s entry level experience was 27 hours below the minimum total
time desired by Henson (2,500 hours) at the time he was hired. His multiengine time was

~-58 hours below the desired time (500 hours), and his actual instrument time was at the

minimum desired time of 75 hours.</div>

MOL when the airplane was approximately abeam the STAUT NDB, it is possible that the
flighterew accepted the abeam indication on the ADF display as passage of the outer
marker, even though the needle would have remained on the left and moved very slowly
aft. At this time, they would have lowered their landing gear, turned on the landing
lights, and begun a descent to the localizer approach minimum descent altitude (MDA) of
1,620 feet. Although the absence of any glideslope indications should have alerted them
to a problem, the reported weather conditions at SHD were well s&gt;ove the localizer-only
landing criteria. Consequently, g.ideslope information would not have been important or
needed to complete the approach and landing. However, since the weather in the
mountains east of SHD probably was worse than the weather reported at SHD, they may
have begun to execute a missed approach after arrival at MDA. In view of the fact that
the airplane crashed with the gear and flaps up, which is the missed approach
configuration, the accident eculd have oceurred during the first moments of this missed
approach attempt. The crew would have had about 1 minute 44 seconds from the time
they acknowledged that they were not. in radar contact until the controller suggested a
missed approach to lower the gear, descend from 2,700 to 1,620 feet, then raise the flaps
and gear, and climb back to 2,400 feet.

Regardiess of what occurred after the flight intercepted the MOL 045° radial,
the flighterew did not detect their sitvation in sufficient time to take the appropriate
action. This factor, as well az the other information regarding the conduct of the
approach, suggests inadequate instrument flying techniques and procedures on the parts of
both pilots, including a failure of the captain to adequately monitor the approach. If the first officer was navigating off the MOL VOR, it is difficult to
understand why the captain did not detect such a gross error. Furthermore, the
considerable time which had elapsed from the initiation of the procedure vurn without

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] This indicates that the altimeter system was
operating properly. The elevation at impact was about 1,675 feet. The altimeter was set at 29.70, the last altimeter setting given to the

crew. Two reasons why the aircraft might have been below its target:
altitude of 1,800 feet are evident. First, the aircraft was entering I
ground effect as it got closer to the ground and this may have caused an
error in the pitot static system which caused the altimeter to indicate
an altitude higher than the actual aircraft altitude. Second, it is
possible that the high winds blowing over the rough terrain in the accident area may have caused a pressure change which affected the
altimeter indication. However, the crew&#x27;s evident concern about the
altitude was indicated by the captain&#x27;s order regarding the power and
the first officer&#x27;s comments about the downdraft when the aircraft .
‘went below the target altitude. Based on the evidence available, the
Safety Board concludes that there was no significant error in the altitude information presented to the pilots by their instruments. The crew&#x27;s comments regarding the altitude and the power
indicate that the first officer was not flying the aircraft at the target
altitude of 1,800 feet. The Board examined the flight data recorder
trace and found that while there was evidence of moderate turbulence,
it was probably not of sufficient magnitude to prevent the first officer
from maintaining the desired altitude. There was also no evidence that
there was any problem within the aircraft that would have prevented
the pilot from staying at 1,800 feet. Therefore, the Board concludes
that the deviation below the target altitude was probably a result of
the combination of the first officer&#x27;s flying technique and the turbulence. From the above, it is clear that this was an operational
accident and that the crew knowingly descended to approximately 1, 800
feet after being cleared for the approach. The basic questions requiring resolution are (1) why did the crew knowingly descend to
1,800 feet in an area where the terrain obstacles extended almost
up to that altitude; and (2) why did the approach clearance not include
an altitude restriction under the circumstances of this case. Our review of the record supports the conclusion that the
captain believed that when he approached the airport in a radar environment for a nonprecision approach he would not be &quot;cleared for
the approach&quot; without an altitude restriction unless he could make

~ 28 -~

an unrestricted descent to the final approach fix altitude. In attempting to determine the reasons for the captain&#x27;s belief in this regard, a
brief description of the development of the usage of radar and its impact on pilot responsibilities is required. Before the advent of radar, the pilot alone was responsible
at all times for knowing the position of his aircraft with regard to the
terrain. The pilot kept the controller informed of the aircraft&#x27;s
position and of the pilot&#x27;s intentions. Typically, during an instrument
approach, numerous radio calls were made as the pilot reported his
position, altitude, and intentions. With the advent of radar, the controller was able to observe
the aircraft in two dimensions -- range and azimuth -- and was able to
_ vector flights to arrive over geographical positions.</div>

Additionally, the Board concludes on the subject of radar arrival
(p. 32):

&quot;,,.under these circumstances, [the clearance] should have
included an altitude restriction until the aircraft had reached a
segment of the published approach procedure or the issuance of
the approach clearance should have been deferred until the flight
reached such segment. . Therefore, the Safety Board concludes
that the clearance was inadequate and its issuance and acceptance
was the result of a misunderstanding between the pilot and the
controller.&quot;

Such a conclusion can again only mean that the flight was in fact a radar
arrival since altitude restrictions are issued only in accordance with
paragraph 1360(c), the provisions of which pertain solely to radar arrivals. Therefore, based upon the foregoing, it would appear the majority believes
the flight was a radar arrival but refuses to make an unambiguous finding
to that effect. .

The Board further states (p. 32) that &#x27;&#x27;there is a general lack of
understanding between pilots and controllers in their interpretations of air
traffic control procedures.&#x27;&#x27; We find that there was no misunderstanding
in this instance on the part of the pilot. As previously stated, he
undoubtedly descended to 1, 800 feet after receiving an approach clearance
because he was not issued an altitude restriction. If the controller was
confused with regard to the application of paragraph 1360,he should have
_asked for clarification from his supervisor. But there should have been no
reason for confusion insofar as terminology is concerned. One of the most
important functions of an air traffic controller is to possess the highest
degree of knowledge in procedures and terminology and to apply it with the
greatest diligence and care. .

In any event, we can only conclude that, innot handling the flight as
a radar arrival, the Dulles controller did not properly apply the provisions
of the controller&#x27;s handbook.</div>

there is no minimum enroute altitude prescribed, while

action is being taken to correct the deficiencies cited above.

McADAMS and HALEY, Members, dissenting:

We do not agree with the probable cause as stated by the majority. In our opinion, the probable cause was the failure of the controller
to issue altitude restrictions in accordance with the Terminal Air Traffic
Control Handbook 7110. 8C, paragraph 1360(c), and the failure of the pilot
to adhere to the minimum sector altitude as depicted on the approach plate
or to request clarification of the clearance. Asa result, the pilot prematurely descended to 1, 800 feet,

The flight was a radar arrival and, the refore, entitled to altitude
protection and terrain clearance. If the controller, as required by the thenexisting procedures for radar arrivals, had issued altitude restrictions with
the approach clearance or had deferred the clearance, the accident probably
would not have occurred, On the other hand, if the pilot had either maintained the minimum sector altitude of 3, 300 feet as depicted on the approach
plate, or requested clarification of the clearance, there would not have been
an accident, ‘

The majority states (p. 32):

&quot;The Board concludes that based on the criteria in 7110. 8C
the system allowed for the classification and handling of Flight 514
as a nonradar arrival. The Board, however, believes that the
flight should have been classified and handled as a &#x27;radar arrival,&#x27;&quot;&#x27;

This statement cannot be reconciled with the probable cause as
stated by the majority. If the majority believes that under all tLe circum -
stances the flight should have been classified and handled as a radar arrival,
then the flight was in fact a radar arrival and the probable cause should so
state. Itis not possible to determine from the majority opinion whether
Flight 514 was a tadar or a nonradar arrival. The Board attributes the failure of the controller to handle the flight
asa radar arrival to be a terminology difficulty between pilots and controllers. There was no terminology difficulty. .The plain fact of the matter
is that the controller simply did not treat the flight as a radar arrival as he
should have, All the criteria of paragraph 1360 for a radar arrival were

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS AND CONCLUSIONS &gt; ANALYSIS] The existence of an error such as that described above is consistent
with certain indications on the flight data recorder. For example, there are
several increases in the rate of descent recorded by the flight recorder
during the final approach indicating that the captain may have been attempting
to compensate for the lower-than-actual rate of descent. Since these descent
rates were all in excess of 1,000 feet/minute, the absence of any required
callout would support the premise that the vertical speed indicator was reflecting a rate of descent lower than the actual descent rate. Moreover,
during the last 10 minutes of flight, there were two instances in which the
flight recorder reflected descents which resulted in overshoots followed by
gradual returns to the desired altitude. We recognize that these overshoots
may have resulted from either the pilot&#x27;s technique in the manual operation
of his flight controls or the use of the aircraft autopilot. It is possible, however, that these overshoots could be symptomatic of a lagging of the aircraft
instruments due to an error within the static systems. Itis also conceivable
that there could be an error in one or all static systems such that it would
manifest itself while the aircraft was descending but not after levelling off. The first of these descents was 175 feet and resulted in an overshoot of 50
feet. The second descent, which occurred at 6 minutes 7 seconds before
impact, was 575 feet with a resultant overshoot of 150 feet. Both of these
overshoots were corrected by a gradual climb back to the desired altitude. The ratio of the amount of overshoot to the total descent is 0.286 and 0. 261,
respectively, or 26 to 29 feet for each 100 feet of descent. The final descent
of 1,200 feet with an apparent overshoot of 318 feet results in an error ratio
of 0.265 or 27 feet per 100 feet of descent, which closely parallels the error
ratios of the two earlier overshoots. With respect to physical evidence pertaining directly to the barometric
altimeters, it appears that both were correctly set at 29.67, thereby eliminating any indicated error from that source. The displacement of the outer
and inner drums, 600 feet and 3,000 feet for the captain&#x27;s and copilot&#x27;s
barometric altimeters, respectively, was the result of impact forces&#x27; overcoming the light spring tension holding them in place. Since the drum
assemblies of both altimeters were essentially identical, the variation in
displacement is attributed to the difference in impact forces encountered.

-~ 26 -

Other damage to the internal mechanism of each barometric altimeter precluded positive determination of their operating capability prior to impact. Nevertheless, if the mark at the 1, 250-foot point on the captain&#x27;s altimeter
drum was made at initial impact, the altimeter was reading 300 feet

high. Similarly, the marking on the first officer&#x27;s altimeter could be construed to indicate an error of approximately 300 feet.</div>

that tests conducted subsequent to the accident demonstrated that the 300foot difference could have been caused by impact forces,

Finally, evidence supportive of an altimeter error can be derived
from the cockpit voice recorder, During the final stages of the descent, the
first officer made four altitude callouts. All of these callouts except the
first, which was made by reference to the ground, were approximately 200
feet higher than the actual altitude of the aircraft as reflected by the flight
data recorder. 14/ Since the barometric altimeter is the primary source
of altitude information, it would be reasonable to assume that these callouts
were made by reference to that instrument. The foregoing discussion constitutes one possible explanation for the
unrecognized descent through MDA by demonstrating how an error in the
static system could mislead the pilots by causing erroneous indications on
the barometric altimeters and the vertical speed indicators. If such an
error did, in fact, occur, then the altimeter would have read 200-300 feet
high, which in turn would account for the fact that the crew did not arrest
the descent until the aircraft reached an altitude of approximately 916
m.s.1l. or over 300 feet below MDA. There is one remaining factor which must be considered in evaluating
the likelihood of an error in the static system instruments. Since an error
in the static system would also affect the indicated airspeed, the Board calculated the effect of a static system error sufficient to cause an indicated
altitude error of approximately 300 feet. The calculation assumed that a
static pressure difference existed between ambient and that sensed by the
altimeter so that when the altimeter indicated 1, 240 feet, the actual altitude
was 916 feet. By use of a calibrated airspeed of 130 knots 15/ and the

the static system continued to sense a static pressure equivalent to 1, 240
feet, and the pilot controlled his aircraft so as to maintain an indicated airspeed of 130 knots.

for altitude reference -~- is not supported by sufficient evidence to be termed
a causal factor in this accident. One final matter, airport facilities, warrants comment. Many of the
circumstances of this accident are typical of the approach/landing accidents
that occur during nonprecision approaches. Asa result, the Board ex-~
amined the environmental conditions that existed in this case to determine
what aids would have assisted the pilot in making a nonprecision approach. The terrain under the approach path was irregular with numerous hills
of varying heights. There were few lights along the approach path excepting
those of the refinery which were to the right of the inbound track. The lower
clouds were ragged and the restrictions to visibility included darkness, rain,
fog, and smoke. The pilot had his barometric altimeter, vertical speed
indicator, airspeed indicator, and radio altimeter to aid him in establishing
the desired descent profile. However, the pilot had little, if any, information instantly available to him regarding the elevation and character of the
terrain below the aircraft or the flightpath related thereto. External navigational aids used to provide vertical guidance to a
pilot during an instrument approach include Precision Approach Radar
(PAR), ILS glide slope, and VASI system. There was no PAR installed at
Huntington nor was the installation of one under consideration. The FAA
policy was to provide VASI systems primarily where no other electronic
guidance was either planned or available. Since Huntington had been actively
negotiating for a glide slope since 1957 no VASI system was installed. In
this case, the VASI system would have been useful if the pilot had been able
to see the first 1,500 feet of the runway. However, if the pilot had not
visually acquired contact with that much of the runway he would not have been
able to use the VASI system for vertical guidance. It is also possible that the nonstandard glide slope which was installed
subsequent to the accident might have prevented this accident in that the
pilot would have been provided with a primary electronic indication of his
position relative to the desired glide path.

the descent progressed or became visually disoriented
and did not initiate missed approach procedures in
time to avoid impact with the trees because they
were not monitoring altitude instruments. The company had ao altitude awareness procedures for
visual flight below MDA or DH. The Federal Aviation Adminstration&#x27;s surveillance of
Atlantic City Airlines was inadequate in that weight
and balance conputations were not monitored and a
formal wind shear training program did not exist. The accident was survivable in the passenger cabin. Survivability in the cockpit was marginal because
penetration by trees destroyed integrity of the left
side of the cockpit. While the use of a shoulder
harness probably would have lessened the severity of
the captain&#x27;s injuries, the availability of a shoulder
harness to the first officer would not have prevented
his fatal injuries. 3.2 Probable Cause

The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the
probable cause of this accident was the flightcrew&#x27;’s lack of altitude
awareness during a circling approach which permitted the aircraft&#x27;s
flightpath to deviate below a safe approach profile. The aircraft&#x27;s
rate of descent ard descent flightpath angle increased as a result of
wind shear encountered during the visual approach below minimum descent
altitude. The flightcrew did not recognize these fligintpath deviations
because they were relying on visual references which were degradeu by
nonhomogeneous fog and on kinesthetic cues which were adversely affecte?

by the aircraft&#x27;s forward center of gravity resulting from the improper, -

loaded aircraft. Contributing to the accident was the lack of company
procedures requiring altitude-callouts during the visual portion of an
instrument approach. BY THE NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD

have provided the crew an opportunity to establish a stabilized approach. However, the
Safety Board must point out that the opportunity for the captain to have asked for radar
vectors was always available. Instead, the approach was continued and the airplane was
never established on the localizer or GS. Although the crew might have been able to make a landing, it would have been
unsafe. In darkness and under the existing weather conditions, it would have been
difficult for the flighterew to have recognized an excessive rate of descent until the
airplane was very low. In addition, the flightcrew probably was susceptible to visual
illusions because there were no other ground lights for reference in the appr: ich zone,
there was water on the windshield, and there was a slight upslope to the runway. These
conditions would have combined to produce a perception that the airplane was higher than
it actually was in relation to the runway. To make a visual approach, a pilot must constantly interpret the changing
visual scene to remain oriented on the proper glidepath to the runway. Pilots must judge
height, speed, distance, and glidepath based on perceived movement of external objects,
their brightness, and their apparent size as well as their relationship to the horizon and
with other objects, and with respect to the airplane&#x27;s orientation in space or its angular
relationship with the runway. Thus, visual perception is a decision-making process based
on a multitude of visual cues,

At night, because visual cues are reduced and are further degraded by weather
and sloping terrain, pilots must rely to a greater extent on flight and navigation
instruments to reach the runway safely. The reduced number of visual cues, such as the

runway and approach lights, mey well provide images that ean be interpreted
inaccurately, causing pilots to make inappropriate decisions. In this instance, flight 1808
could have become visual at about 1 to 11/2 miles from the airport. Therefore, the
crewmembers would only have seen the 3,000-foot long approach light system and perhaps
the runway threshold. Without further foveal or peripheral visual cues, an {{illusion would
bs created that the airplane was too high in relation to the expected visual light scene,
i.@., 3,000 feet of approech lights plus 5,000 feet of runway lights. An additional visual
iflusion would have been creaced by the featureless and unlit terrain surrounding and
preceding the approach lighting system. This is called the &quot;black-hole approach” and
concerns approach to a lighted runway (or in this case to the approach lighting svstem)
over dark featureless terrain beyond which the horizon is not discernible. Simulated tests
of both visual conditions have shown that a pilot tends to descend along the are of a
eirele, the circumference of which touches the ground short of the runway lights.</div>

the final approach fix and the captain&#x27;s altimeter could have been a
factor in premature descent below DH. During the final seconds of the approach, the flighterew was probably
infivenced by visual illusions caused by the weather, sloping terrain, high
rate of descent, and darkness which contributed to e premature descent
below DH. The cockpit noise level in the Beech 99 probably was a fector in the
flighterew&#x27;s ability to communicate with each other. Compsny management failed to insure that flighterews were adhering to
company standards and operating procedures. FAA surveillance was affected adversely by inadequate manpower and
failed to insure that operational standards within the company were
maintained.

23. The airline’s pilot turnover rate was sufficient to have reduced the
overall experience level of the pilot workforce within the company.

24, The accident was not survivable. 3.2 Probable Cause

The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause
of the aceident was the captain&#x27;s continuation of an unstabilized approach which resulted
in a descent below glideslope. Contributing to the unstabilized approach was the radar
controller&#x27;s issuance and the captain&#x27;s acceptance of a nonstandard air traffie control
radar vector resulting in an excessive intercept with the localizer.

4, RECOMMENDATIONS

As a result of its investigation, the Safety Board reiterated the following
recommendations to the Federal Aviation Administration:

Establish for aircraft used in commercial operation the maximum
cockpit noise levels which will permit adequate direct volce
communication between flight crewmembers under all operating
conditions. (Class Il, Priority Action) (A-81-75)

The flighterew executed an unstabilized approach contrary to company
procedures and safe operating practices. It is possible that the crew may not have
realized how close they were to the LOM before the controller advised them of their
position. Station passage would have deen indicated by the swing of the ADF needle, the
blinking marker beacon Hight, and associated audible tone if it were selected on. The
radar track and marker beacon signal pattern indicates that the crew should have received
the marker beacon signal. However, it appears the airplane may have already “zen inside
the LOM and the ADF would not have indicated station passage. At this point the
airplane was 500 feet above the GS intercept altitude at 165 KIAS, 15 knots above the
company recommended flap extension speed and 35 knots above the company
recommended landing gear extension speed, and the rate of descent had increased to 2,206
feet per minute. Under these cireumstancey, it is conceivable that the crew would have been
late in configuring the airplane for landing and would have been behind in accomplishing
the checklist. Late extension of approach flaps und ‘anding gear could have contributed
to the elimb to 2,300 feet and rapid descent to 1,700 feet beforsa the airplane was
stabilized at a descent rate of about 1,300 feet per minute. These events would
contribute to a high workload on the flighterew at a critical time In the approach. They
might have had a tendency to fucus or concentrate only on certain data to the exclusion
of other information that also may have been equally importent and failed to make the
required call-outs. Such behavior is termed &quot;selective attention&quot; in psychological terms. That is, as workload increases and the resultant level of stress on the pilot increases, the
normal seanning and cross~-cheeking techniques and crew coordination break down. The
pilot(s) therefore might focus or concentrate on certain instruments or controls to the
exclusion of others. As a result, the airplane was never stabilized on the ILS. It is

Aircraft Accident Report

pilot’s relatively short time flying in the local area suggests that his cognitive map of the terrain 
between Rudyerd Bay and Ketchikan may not have been as detailed or accurate compared to those 
of other pilots who had more local flying experience. Considering all these factors, it is possible 
that the accident pilot mistook the first mountain for the second one and turned the airplane west 
too early; such a mistake, in which a pilot does not recognize or maintain the desired position 
relative to the external ground and airspace environment is an example of geographic 
disorientation (Antuñano, Mohler, and Gosbee 1989). The fact that the pilot subsequently 
continued the flight straight and level at an altitude that would have been sufficient to clear terrain 
on the typical route (but was insufficient to clear the high terrain he was flying toward) further 
supports the possibility that the pilot was geographically disoriented. Thus, the NTSB concludes 
that the pilot’s continued flight in low-visibility conditions at a lower-than-normal vantage point 
in an area in which he lacked extensive flying experience reduced his ability to visually identify 
landmarks and resulted in a navigational error due to geographic disorientation. 
2.2.3 CFIT 
According to recorded flight data, the airplane’s final turn to the west occurred about 
half-standard rate; then the airplane continued on a nearly straight and level flightpath toward the 
higher terrain for about 30 seconds. In the final 2 seconds of the flight, the airplane pitched up 
rapidly, experiencing a vertical acceleration of about +2 Gs before colliding with terrain. The

pilot’s relatively short time flying in the local area suggests that his cognitive map of the terrain 
between Rudyerd Bay and Ketchikan may not have been as detailed or accurate compared to those 
of other pilots who had more local flying experience. Considering all these factors, it is possible 
that the accident pilot mistook the first mountain for the second one and turned the airplane west 
too early; such a mistake, in which a pilot does not recognize or maintain the desired position 
relative to the external ground and airspace environment is an example of geographic 
disorientation (Antuñano, Mohler, and Gosbee 1989). The fact that the pilot subsequently 
continued the flight straight and level at an altitude that would have been sufficient to clear terrain 
on the typical route (but was insufficient to clear the high terrain he was flying toward) further 
supports the possibility that the pilot was geographically disoriented. Thus, the NTSB concludes 
that the pilot’s continued flight in low-visibility conditions at a lower-than-normal vantage point 
in an area in which he lacked extensive flying experience reduced his ability to visually identify 
landmarks and resulted in a navigational error due to geographic disorientation. 
2.2.3 CFIT 
According to recorded flight data, the airplane’s final turn to the west occurred about 
half-standard rate; then the airplane continued on a nearly straight and level flightpath toward the 
higher terrain for about 30 seconds. In the final 2 seconds of the flight, the airplane pitched up 
rapidly, experiencing a vertical acceleration of about +2 Gs before colliding with terrain. The 
timing of the pilot’s aggressive pitch-up maneuver strongly supports the scenario that the pilot 
continued the flight into near-zero visibility conditions and, as soon as he realized that the flight 
was on a collision course with the terrain, he pulled aggressively on the elevator flight controls in 
an ineffective attempt to avoid the collision. Effective CFIT avoidance requires assessment of weather conditions and appropriate

typically fly southwest over Ella Lake and proceed beyond the south end of the lake before turning 
west. This route allows the flights to avoid the high terrain located west of the lake, which includes 
two similarly shaped mountains. (See figure 16.) 
 
Figure 16. The typical flight route (white) passes two similarly shaped mountains before turning 
west. For comparison, the path flown by the accident pilot is shown in green. Although the accident pilot climbed the airplane to an altitude that would have provided 
safe terrain clearance along the typical route, he deviated from that route and turned the airplane 
west after it passed only the first of the two mountains. The pilot’s route deviation placed the 
airplane on a collision course with the 1,900-ft second mountain, which it struck at an elevation of 
about 1,600 ft msl. (See figure 17.)

Figure 17. The path flown by the accident pilot (green), viewed from the approximate altitude of 
the accident airplane, is shown turning to the west (right) after passing the first mountain. Note: A translucent mask is imposed on the image to provide a notional representation of reduced visibility weather 
conditions. The vantage point of the image distorts the flight route depiction in the foreground (where the segment of 
the route originates in the bottom center of the image); there is no steep vertical climb in the flight route at the location 
shown in the foreground. Research suggests that, when navigating, people find their way through large-scale 
environments by learning to identify key landmarks (route knowledge) and developing map-like 
internal representations (cognitive maps) of the area. When traveling, people use the landmarks to 
update their position on their internal cognitive map and decide when and where to turn 
(Golledge 2010). However, a number of factors can increase the likelihood of navigational errors. Navigational errors are more likely if landmarks are difficult to discern or if cognitive maps are 
inaccurate (Golledge 2010). Landmarks are more difficult to discern when visibility of fine detail 
is degraded or when landmarks are viewed from an unfamiliar vantage point (Cuqlock-Knopp and 
Whitaker 1993; Schreiber et al. 1998). 
Several factors were present during the accident flight that increased the likelihood that the 
pilot would make a navigational error.35 Visibility was degraded over the south end of Ella Lake; 
thus, the pilot may not have been able to clearly distinguish some of the landmarks by which he 
typically navigated. In addition, the accident pilot was flying the route at a relatively low altitude 
because of the poor weather conditions, which resulted in his viewing terrain from a 
lower-than-normal vantage point. (The accident pilot had transited the area earlier that day about 
2,000 ft msl, and other Promech pilots had flown about 2,500 to 3,000 ft msl.) Further, the accident

engine conversion resulted in less efficient clearance of rain from the windscreen. However, investigators were unable

It should be emphasized that the possible explanation discussed imnediately above is based not only on evidence that is tenuous, at beat, but
aleo on the inferences to be drawn from such evidenc. as to what thought
processes were evolving in the mlnds of the flightcrew. Obviously, such
an explanation is, to a considerable degree, speculative in nature. It
is nevertheless the intent of the Board that, by including this discussion
in the report, pilots will be alerted against the possibility of lapsing
into such a pattern when utilizing a QFE altimeter setting procedure. We
also hasten to add that, even if it is assuned that the sequence of events
described in the above discussion in fact occurred, this should be taken
to reflect adversely not on Eastern&#x27;s system, but rather on the flightcrew&#x27;s implementation of that system in this instance, By vixtue of
training, experience, cockpit instrumentation, navigational aids, and approach plates, this crew was well equipped to accomplish the approach to
Charlotte safely, and there is no causal factor beyond the flightcrew it~
self which would account for their failure to do so. This accident exenplifies the absolute necessity of strict adherence to prescribed procedures, particularly those pertaining to altitude awareness, during an
instrument approach,

Survivability

{{. The occupiable area of the cabir. was compromised when
the fuselage broke up,

2, The intense postimpact fire consumed the occuplable area of
the tail section and the entire center section of the cabin,

3, The occupant restraint systam failed in many instances,

the approach, It is possible that the crew, beceuse of the extended dura~
tion of flight in VMC &gt;ove a low, patchy fog bank through which intermittent ground contact way possible, may have relaxed their instrument scan
and relied more heavily upon visval cues to fly the approach, Such a possibility is consistent, not only with the discussion of Carowinds Tower
described above, but also with the captain&#x27;s remark, shortly before in
pact, that &quot;All we got to do is find the airport,&quot; and the firet officor&#x27;e
response of “Yean.&quot;’ Ultimately, when the aircraft penetrated the densa
fog around the eccident site, visual reference would hava been lost and a
switch to instrument flight would not have been possible within the availeable tima, Tha mount likely explarction of why Flight 212 was unable to
establish visual contact with tha runway environrent, whereas other
flights were able to do so and thereby complete the approach, is that
Flight 212, flying at a lower altitude, initially entered the fog bank at
a point farther from the runway threshold and thus had a greater slante
range distance through shich to sight the runway markings through the fog. Another possible reason for the crew&#x27;s lack of altitude awareness
involves the interrelationship between QNH (above sea level) and QFE
(above field elevation) altitudes during the approach.

have cortinued to fly the aircraft below MDA without starting a climb. Since the aircraft
was traveling 0.2 mile each 6 seconds and was near the hill when such an error was noted,
there was too little time ror corrective measures to be made before the impact. The
impact marks on the aircraft and the observations of the survivors indicate that no
attempt war. made by the flighterew to climb in the seconds before impact. However,
even this series of events also does not justify 6 descent below MDA of 114 feet. The events of the accident established that a premature descent to MDA was
made by the flightcrew. Therefore, the Safety Board attempted to determine why a
well-trained, professional flighterew would fail to utilize a critical piece of equipment. When Flight 20! arrived in the Spokane area, several events occurred that
increased the flightcrew&#x27;s workload, or could have distracted them during required cockpit
procedures. The change of runways and the new instrument epproach procedure would
have resulted in a new approach chart review and briefing. Although the cockpit workload
was increased, there was ample time to complete the approach chart famillarization. During the ATC vectors, Flight 201 was given turns for spacing, which included vectors
across the final approach course and then away from the course. It is possible these
vectors led the flightcrew to believe that the aircraft was too close to the final approach
fix, or at least closer than desirable. This perception would have made it easier later for
the flighterew to accept the DME mileage from tie Spokane VORTAC as the mileage
from the localizer DME transmitter. Testimony from other pilots who have made similar
errors illustrates that they failed to realize their situation even when questioned by ATC,
Perceptions are formed by sensory inputs, past experiences, and expectations, or probable
occurrences. These processes form the basis for decision-making. Associated with
expectations is familiarity with the environment, and the flightcrew of Plight 201 was
familiar with the Spokane environment. The fact that, after the landing checklist was
completed, the cockpit appeared to be configured properly may well have reinforced the
pilots! expectations regarding their position on the approach. Finally, since the lovalizer frequency was not activated until the aircraft was
nearly on the localizer course, a situation was created that required the flightecrew to
navigate on the course before the navigation aid was identified. The normal procedure
was to tune and Identify the localizer frequency and then intercept the localizer course. Flight 201 was cn the course when the localizer wes activated. In a short period of time,
the flighterew had to establish the aircraft on the course centerline, identify the locolizer
facility, and begin a descent to the final approach altitude.</div>

3. CONCLUSIONS 3.1 Findings

The flightcrew was properly certificated, qualified, and treined for the
ight. The aircraft was properly certificated and maintained according to
approved procedures. The propellers, engines, and flight control systems operated properly. The ATC handling of Flight 201 In the Spokane terminal area was proper. The flightcrew was not performing ct expected levels of professional
proficiency on the day of the accident for unknown reasons. The flighterew had sufficient time to review the localizer 3 approach
chart. The flightcrew probably had both navigation receivers tuned to the
localizer frequency just before the aircraft intercepted the localizer
course. The DME mode selector was probably set in the &quot;Hold&quot; position during
the interception of the localizer course aid the instrument approsch. The flightcrew did not realize the actual position of the aircraft when
Flight 201 was cleared for the instrument approach. Sr EW ka Nene, Aa,“ sas” esptenttny Se yest A Aaah TEN: te sites TMi CEE ta Oe ENE at gs ON DE a OY aa - ene rr

The gear warning horn and light provided a distraction to the flightcrew
at a time when the flighterew should have deel positioning the DME
mode selector to the No, 1 or the No. 2 position. The locallzer $ approach chart could cause confusion by portraying two
DME frequencies without including a precautionary note to pilots about
use of the correct frequency. The flighterew descended prematurely to the minimum descent altitude
based on a 4.2 DME Indication which emanated froin the Spokane
VORTAC. The premature descent was a result of improper operation of the DME
mode selector. The flightcrew failed to identify the localizer DME facility. The aircraft was in ‘nstrument meteorological conditions at impact. The flighterew apparently noted the DME mode selector error just
before impact but not in time to initiate a climb to a safe altitude. The reason the flight descended 114 feet below the minimum descent
altitude is not known. The public address system was inoperative, so the before-landing
announcements were not heard in the cabin. Sone passengers did not have their seatbelt fastened. The accident was nonsurvivabte because of the impact forces which
exceeded human tolerance for seatbelt-only restrained occupants and
because of high g-forces and the disruption of the seat and restraint
system,

21. The passengers who survived did so because they had fastened their
seatbelis and assumed a brace position.

otherwise they would not have desvended below 3,500 feet until reaching OLAKE

concludes instead that the flightcrew aligned the aircraft with the localizer course and

an itamediate deseznt once the approach clearance was received because they
mistakenly believed they were almost at OLAKE tntersection, rather than being several
miles short of it. The second key event which distracted the flightcrew&#x27;s attention from the

approach clearance was received, the normal Cascade Airways procedure for 7light 201
was to descend from 4,000 to 3,500 feet. As the first officer reduced power to begin the
descent, the captain should have put the DME mode selector in the No. 1 or No. 2 position

handle contains a re¢ light which illuminates and which is accompanted by the sounding of
@ buzzer if the landing gear is not extended when the throttles ars reduced below
79 percent of the engine speed. The survivor also stated that these eveits were followed
by two cycles of the landing gear. It is likely that the two landing yeer cycles were
actually the gear lowering into place, which would have silenced the gzar warnings, and
the flaps lowering into place. The distraction caused by the landing gcar and the gear
warning devices would have occurred at the time the captain should have corfigured the
navigation radios and the DME mode selector. Since the landing gear handle was located
in front of the captain, he probably lowered the gears and flaps and his attention was
probably temporarily diverted to the landing gear and the landing checklist and away from
the DME mode selector and the navigational radios. With the landing gear down and the flaps positioned for the approach, the
cockpit would have appeared to be configured properly. Both navigation radios would
normally have been tuned to the localizer frequency and the aircraft would have becn on
the centerline of the localizer. However, the Sazety Board believes that the DME mode
seicctor was in the &quot;Hold&quot; position and that the mileage displayed was the mileage from
the Spokane VORTAC. The flightcrew would have had to remember the source of the
DME mileage since the use of the &quot;Hold&quot; button Is not accompanied by a frequency
display.</div>

173
Aircraft Accident Report
10. The captain may have mistakenly believed that the airplane was closer to the airport
than its actual position; however, if the captain conducted the flight’s descent on this
basis, he did so in disregard of the DME fix definitions shown on the approach chart.
11. As a result of his confusion and preoccupation with the status of the glideslope,
failure to properly cross-check the airplane’s position and altitude with the
information on the approach chart, and continuing expectation of a visual approach,
the captain lost awareness of flight 801’s position on the instrument landing system
localizer-only approach to runway 6L at Guam International Airport and improperly
descended below the intermediate approach altitudes of 2,000 and 1,440 feet, which
was causal to the accident.
12. The first officer and flight engineer noted the ground proximity warning system
(GPWS) callouts and the first officer properly called for a missed approach, but the
captain’s failure to react properly to the GPWS minimums callout and the direct
challenge from the first officer precluded action that might have prevented the
accident.
13. The first officer and flight engineer failed to properly monitor and/or challenge the
captain’s performance, which was causal to the accident.
14. Monitored approaches decrease the workload of the flying pilot and increase flight
crew interaction, especially when experienced captains monitor and prompt first
officers during the execution of approaches.
15. The captain was fatigued, which degraded his performance and contributed to his
failure to properly execute the approach.
16. Korean Air’s training in the execution of nonprecision approaches was ineffective,
which contributed to the deficient performance of the flight crew.
17. U.S. air carrier pilots would benefit from additional training and practice in
nonprecision approaches during line operations (in daytime visual conditions in
which such a practice would not add a risk factor).
18. The Combined Center/Radar Approach Control controller’s performance was
substandard in that he failed to provide the flight crew with a position advisory when
he cleared the flight for the approach, inform the flight crew or the Agana tower
controller that he had observed a rain shower on the final approach path, and monitor
the flight after the frequency change to the tower controller.
19. Strict adherence to air traffic control procedures by the Combined Center/Radar
Approach Control controller may have prevented the accident or reduced its severity. Conclusions

Aircraft Accident Report
20. If the ARTS IIA minimum safe altitude warning system had been operating as
initially intended, a visual and aural warning would have activated about 64 seconds
before flight 801 impacted terrain, and this warning would have likely alerted the
Combined Center/Radar Approach Control controller that the airplane was
descending below the minimum safe altitude for that portion of the approach.

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] Thus, the captain
may have failed to track the airplane’s position on the approach because he believed that
he would regain visual conditions, the airplane was receiving a valid glideslope signal,
and/or the airplane was closer to the airport than its actual position. Regardless of the reason for failing to track the airplane’s position, the captain
conducted the approach without properly cross-referencing the positional fixes defined by
the VOR and DME with the airplane’s altitude. Therefore, the Safety Board concludes
that, as a result of his confusion and preoccupation with the status of the glideslope, failure
to properly cross-check the airplane’s position and altitude with the information on the
approach chart, and continuing expectation of a visual approach, the captain lost
awareness of flight 801’s position on the ILS localizer-only approach to runway 6L at
Guam International Airport and improperly descended below the intermediate approach
altitudes of 2,000 and 1,440 feet, which was causal to the accident.
2.4.2 Flight Crew Monitoring of the Approach
CVR evidence indicated that the flight crew seemed confused about, and did not
react to, a series of audible ground proximity warning system (GPWS) alerts during the
final approach. The first audible GPWS callout occurred about 0141:42, with the “one
thousand [feet]” altitude call. A second GPWS callout of “five hundred [feet]” occurred
about 0142:00 (when the airplane was descending through about 1,200 feet msl), to which
the flight engineer responded in astonishment, “eh?” However, FDR data indicated that no
change in the airplane’s descent profile followed, and the CVR indicated that the flight
engineer continued to complete the landing checklist. Similarly, no flight crew discussion
followed the GPWS callout of “minimums” about 0142:14, and the first officer dismissed
a GPWS “sink rate” alert 3 seconds later by stating “sink rate okay.” About 0142:19, the
flight engineer called “two hundred [feet],” followed immediately by the first officer
saying “let’s make a missed approach.” The flight engineer immediately responded “not in
sight,” followed by the first officer repeating “not in sight missed approach.” According to
the CVR, a rapid succession of GPWS altitude callouts down to 20 feet followed, as the
flight crew attempted to execute the missed approach. 
196 Human factors research has shown that a common decision-making error, especially in high stress and
workload situations, is for people to tend to ignore evidence that does not support an initial decision. Human
“operators tend to seek (and therefore find) information that confirms the chosen hypothesis and to avoid
information or tests whose outcome could disconfirm it,” which produces an “inertia which favors the
hypothesis initially formulated.” See Wickens, C. (1992). Engineering Psychology and Human
Performance, 2nd Edition. Columbus, Ohio: Charles E.</div>

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS AND CONCLUSIONS &gt; ANALYSIS] Based on the
vectors and clearances given to the flight, especially the clearance to
MDA, the captain should have realized that his aircraft was at, or about
to pass, the FAF. The evidence indicated that he was reluctant to Jower
the gear until he was estabiished on the final approach heading. Because of this delay, the landing flaps were not extended. Both of these delays increased the captain&#x27;s workload during the descent
and contributed to producing the major causal area of the accident---a
lack of altitude awareness. The delay in extending the landing gear and
the resultant delay in beginning the before-landing final checklist also
contributed in part to the first officer&#x27;s failure to previde the captain
with some of his required altitude callouts. Except for monitoring, crosschecking, and calling abnormal
conditions to the captain&#x27;s attention &quot;in the lower altitude portions of
an instrument approach,&quot; no specific altitude awareness responsibilities
were assigned to the flight engineer. The evidence showed that he was
busy with his assigned checklist duties after the aircraft descended
through 1,000 ft. The captain called for “gear down&quot; at 940 ft and for
the before-landing finri checklist 1 to 2 sec later. Since the first
four items on the checklist were accomplished by the flight engineer and
since he challenged the first officer with the fifth iten, &quot;landing gear
and lever,&quot; 10 sec later, he obviously was involved in accomplishing the
checklist. The GPWS alert sounded about 3 sec after the first officer
responded to the &quot;landing gear and lever&quot; checklist challenge.

“with regard to the first officer, the evidence disclosed that
either he did not leok at his altimeter or he did not perceive what he
saw until the aircraft was at 100 ft. At this point, the aircraft was
descending at 20 fps. Although he claimed he thought the altimeter read
1,100 ft, he was abie to resolve the error quickly since he made a 50-ft
callout. The evidence also indicated that, except for resetting the
altitude alerter and extending the landing gear, the first officer&#x27;s
attention was directed outside the cockpit until he was required to
respond to the flight engineer’s checklist challenge, &quot;landing gear and
lever.&quot;

Since the controls of the altitude alerter are located on ‘top
of the instrument p-nel&#x27;s glare shield, its use requires that the crewmember&#x27;s attention be ci:ected away from the flight instruments while he
is manipulating the controls. According to the first. officer and captain,
the alerter was reset to the new missed approach altitude of 2,000 ft
after the aireraft left 1,300 ft. A full 2-sec. altit.ide alert sounded
as the aircraft passed through 700 ft, the height which would approxinate

the upper aural warning altitude had tne system been set to the MDA. Since the first officer and captain denied that it was set to the MDA,
it is possible that the signal was spurizus; its cause could not be
determined by the evidence. The first officer&#x27;s duties also require him to seek ground
cues during the descent.</div>

on the indicated altitude has been discussed previously. While the
evidence does not indicate whether the crew was aware of the SIGMETS
issued for the Washington area, there is no evidence to indicate that
knowledge of the SIGMETS would have caused the crew to operate
any differently than they did.

&quot;= 35 -

The CVR indicates that the crew did encounter considerable
turbulence during the descent. However, the record also indicates
that they.were able to read the altimeters well enough to know that
they had descended below their target altitude of 1,800 feet. The
Safety Board believes that the effect of turbulence was not critical
but could not determine positively why the descent was not arrested
at 1,800 feet. .

In summary, this accident resulted from a combination of .
conditions which included a lack of understanding between the controller and the pilot as to which air traffic control criteria were
being applied to the flight while it was operating in instrument
meteorological conditions in the terminal area. Neither the pilot
nor the controller understood what the other was thinking or planning
when the approach clearance was issued. The captain did not react
correctly to his own doubt about the line of action he had selected
because he did not contact the controller for clarification. The
action of the other air carrier pilot who questioned the clearance he
received about 1/2 hour before the accident is the kind of reaction
that should be expected of a pilot suddenly confronted with uncertainty
about the altitude at which he should operate his aircraft. The Board again stresses that it is incumbent upon air carrier management to assure the highest possible degree of safety
through an assertive exercise of its operational control responsibility. This management function must assure that flightcrews are provided
with all information essential to the safe conduct of flight operations. Furthermore, the air carrier must assure that its flightcrews are
indoctrinated in the operational control precept and that during flight
the final and absolute responsibility for the safe conduct of the flight
rests solely with the captain as pilot-in-command regardless of
mitigating influences which may appear to dilute or derogate this
authority. Whereas the air carriers and the pilots are expected to per-—
form their services with the highest degree of care and safety, this
same high level of performance must be expected from the management of the air traffic control system and the controller. The instant

on the indicated altitude has been discussed previously. While the
evidence does not indicate whether the crew was aware of the SIGMETS
issued for the Washington area, there is no evidence to indicate that
knowledge of the SIGMETS would have caused the crew to operate
any differently than they did.

&quot;= 35 -

The CVR indicates that the crew did encounter considerable
turbulence during the descent. However, the record also indicates
that they.were able to read the altimeters well enough to know that
they had descended below their target altitude of 1,800 feet. The
Safety Board believes that the effect of turbulence was not critical
but could not determine positively why the descent was not arrested
at 1,800 feet. .

In summary, this accident resulted from a combination of .
conditions which included a lack of understanding between the controller and the pilot as to which air traffic control criteria were
being applied to the flight while it was operating in instrument
meteorological conditions in the terminal area. Neither the pilot
nor the controller understood what the other was thinking or planning
when the approach clearance was issued. The captain did not react
correctly to his own doubt about the line of action he had selected
because he did not contact the controller for clarification. The
action of the other air carrier pilot who questioned the clearance he
received about 1/2 hour before the accident is the kind of reaction
that should be expected of a pilot suddenly confronted with uncertainty
about the altitude at which he should operate his aircraft. The Board again stresses that it is incumbent upon air carrier management to assure the highest possible degree of safety
through an assertive exercise of its operational control responsibility. This management function must assure that flightcrews are provided
with all information essential to the safe conduct of flight operations. Furthermore, the air carrier must assure that its flightcrews are
indoctrinated in the operational control precept and that during flight
the final and absolute responsibility for the safe conduct of the flight
rests solely with the captain as pilot-in-command regardless of
mitigating influences which may appear to dilute or derogate this
authority. Whereas the air carriers and the pilots are expected to per-—
form their services with the highest degree of care and safety, this
same high level of performance must be expected from the management of the air traffic control system and the controller. The instant
case provides a classic and tragic example of a pilot and controller
who did not fully comprehend the seriousness of the issuance and’
acceptance of a clearance which was not precise or definitive. The
pilot should question a clearance which leaves any doubt as to what

clearance received further instructions and information which resulted in their accepting a radar
surveillance approach to Dulles. )

Both military and civil aviation officials for several
years had indicated concern regarding a lack of
understanding on their part of what the Air Traffic
Control procedures and terminology were intended
to convey to the pilots. They were also concerned
about the possibility of misunderstandings which
could result in pilots descending prematurely.

&#x27; The FAA was not responsive to the long standing,

expressed needs and concerns of the users of the
Air Traffic Control System with regard to pilot/
controller responsibilities pursuant to the issuance
of an approach clearance for a nonprecision
approach. Furthermore, the FAA did not provide
users of the Air Traffic Control System with sufficient information regarding the services provided
by the system under specific conditions. The FAA did not utilize the capability of the ARTS

III system to insure terrain clearance for descending
aircraft conducting nonprecision instrument approaches
in instrument meteorological conditions. The flightcrew of Flight 514 was not familiar with
the terrain west and northwest of Dulles. However,
they did have information regarding the elevation of
obstacles west of Round Hill intersection depicted
on the plan view of the approach procedure.

b.. Probable Cause

The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the
probable cause of the accident was the crew&#x27;s decision to descend to 1, 800
feet before the aircraft had reached the approach segment where that
minimum altitude applied. The crew&#x27;s decision to descend was a result

of inadequacies and lack of clarity in the air traffic control procedures
which led to a misunderstanding on the part of the pilots and of the controllers regarding each other&#x27;s responsibilities during operations in
terminal areas under instrument meteorological conditions. Nevertheless, the examination of the plan view of the approach chart should have
disclosed to the captain that a minimum altitude of 1, 800 feet was not a
safe altitude. ‘ ,

Contributing factors were:

(1) The failure of the FAA to take timely action to resolve
the confusion and misinterpretation of air traffic terminology although
the Agency had been aware of the problem for several years;

(2) The issuance of the approach clearance when the flight
was 44 miles from the airport on an unpublished route without clearly
defined minimum altitudes; and

(3) Inadequate depiction of altitude restrictions on the profile
view of the approach chart for the VOR/DME approach to runway 12 at
Dulles International Airport.

3, RECOMMENDATIONS

As a result of the accident, the Safety Board submitted 14
recommendations to the Administrator of the Federal Aviation
Administration. (See Appendix I.)

Subsequent to the accident, the FAA has taken several actions
in an effort to prevent recurrence of this type of accident.

1. The FAA has directed that all air carrier aircraft be
equipped with a ground proximity warning system by
December 1975.

2. The FAA has revised the provisions of 14 CFR 91 with
regard to pilot responsibilities and actions after receiving a clearance for a nonprecision approach.

3. The FAA has established an incident reporting system
which is intended to identify unsafe operating conditions
in order that they can be corrected before an accident
occurs.

.~ 4] -

4. The FAA has changed its air traffic control procedures
to provide for the issuance of altitude restrictions during
nonprecision instrument approaches.

5. The FAA is installing a modification to the ARTS III
system that will alert air traffic controllers when aircraft deviate from predetermined altitudes while operating
in the terminal area.</div>

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] The ensuing events demonstrated that the extension of the VFR restriction did not correct the
problem. The extension aggravated the pilot&#x27;s dilemma by preventing him
from climbing to a higher altitude, and extending his exposure to the
encroaching terrain. It also delayed the controller&#x27;s decision that the
aircraft had reached an unsafe position, and his consideration of other
possible courses of action. The events also disclosed that the controller would have beer
better advised to have requested a position report from the pilot at
initial contact. Had that been done, he could have determined the
aircraft&#x27;s position relative to the terrain, and then kept it clear of
the mountain by either amending the route of flight, or altitude or
both, without resorting tu extending the VFR restriction. The controller&#x27;s decision that the aircraft vas in an unsafe
position was based on his determination by yvadar of the aircraft&#x27;s
position relative to the mountain, nowever the situation had probably
become critical 30 seconds earlier when the pilot reported that he was
unable te maintain VFR conditions, and assumed even more critical proportions when the pilot reported he would have to descend in order to
comp.y vith the VFR restriction. Since there was no confliccing traffic
in the a-ea, and in view of the precipitous terrain, the controller
should hare cleared the aircraft to climb in IFR conditions and should

heve taken the necessary teasurces to as: ~ it would remain clear of any
other traffic which could get in its way swever, once the controller
made the decision thar the aircraft was i.. in unsafe position, he did
not hesitate to exercise his emergency authority and vector the aircraft
even though it was below his MVA, ard was not VFR. The vector was
timely; the evidence disclosed that the pilot did turn to avoid the
peak and its associated high terrain. The Safety Board is tnabie to determine what effect tho regqucst
to maintain VFR had on the pilot&#x27;s conduct of the flight efter he received
the vector to 180°. Had the aircraft crashed on a heading approximating
the 180° vector and at an altitude and distance approximating a ccatrolled
descent uuder instrument conditions. further analyais in this area might
be warranted; however it did not. The aircraft&#x27;s altitude at impact,
the elevation of the accident site, and its location when compared with
its position when the controller issued the vector to 180° suggest a
different course of events. N999MB was about 5 nmi couth of Mt. Wrightson when the vector
to reverse course was issued, and the controller saw the aircraft start
a left turn on his radar. He saw the aircraft&#x27;s data block 1 minute
later, and it was further south of the position he had originally acquired
the aircraft&#x27;s target. Its altitude readout was 8,600 ft. The aircraft
impacted on a heading of 095° in a right wing low and noseup attitude. The crash site was about the same distance from Mt.</div>

Findings
1.
The captain and first officer were properly certificated and qualified in accordance
with, and had received the training and rest time prescribed by, Federal regulations
and company requirements. The flight crewmembers possessed valid and current
medical certificates appropriate for 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121 flight
operations.
2.
The accident airplane was properly certificated and maintained and was equipped and
dispatched in accordance with applicable regulations and industry practices. There
was no evidence of any preexisting powerplant, system, or structural failure.
3.
The accident airplane’s cargo and its loading were not factors in the accident.
4.
Although the weather did not cause this accident, the low ceiling and reduced
visibility at Kirksville Regional Airport made the nonprecision approach more
challenging.
5.
Corporate Airlines’ policies, procedures, and training were consistent with industry
standards.
6.
 Air traffic control was not a factor in the accident.
7.
The emergency response did not adversely affect the survivability of this accident.
8.
An enhanced ground proximity warning system (required by Federal regulation since
March 29, 2005), would have provided the pilots with a “too low terrain” alert in
sufficient time to avoid collision with the trees.
9.
Although the accident airplane’s 1,200 feet per minute (fpm) rate of descent was
consistent with company procedure, it varied from current Federal Aviation
Administration guidance that recommends a descent rate of no more than 1,000 fpm
below 1,000 feet above ground level.
10. The pilots failed to follow established procedures to effectively monitor the airplane’s
descent rate and height above terrain during the later stages of the approach and relied
too much on minimal external visual cues. Although descent rate and altitude
information were readily available through cockpit instruments, both pilots were
largely preoccupied with looking for the approach lights. Conclusions
57
Aircraft Accident Report
11. The pilots’ nonessential conversation below 10,000 feet mean sea level was contrary
to established sterile cockpit regulations and reflected a demeanor and cockpit
environment that fostered deviation from established standard procedures, crew
resource management disciplines, division of duties, and professionalism, reducing
the margin of safety well below acceptable limits during the accident approach and
likely contributing to the pilots’ degraded performance.
12. Compliance with sterile cockpit rules may have resulted in an increased focus on
standard procedures and professionalism during the accident flight.
13. The captain should have, but did not, arrest the airplane’s rapid descent when they
reached the minimum descent altitude (MDA), and the first officer should have, but
did not, challenge the captain’s descent below the MDA.
14. The use of a constant-angle-of-descent approach technique, with its resultant
stabilized, moderate rate-of-descent flightpath, and obstacle clearance, would have

Findings
1.
The captain and first officer were properly certificated and qualified in accordance
with, and had received the training and rest time prescribed by, Federal regulations
and company requirements. The flight crewmembers possessed valid and current
medical certificates appropriate for 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121 flight
operations.
2.
The accident airplane was properly certificated and maintained and was equipped and
dispatched in accordance with applicable regulations and industry practices. There
was no evidence of any preexisting powerplant, system, or structural failure.
3.
The accident airplane’s cargo and its loading were not factors in the accident.
4.
Although the weather did not cause this accident, the low ceiling and reduced
visibility at Kirksville Regional Airport made the nonprecision approach more
challenging.
5.
Corporate Airlines’ policies, procedures, and training were consistent with industry
standards.
6.
 Air traffic control was not a factor in the accident.
7.
The emergency response did not adversely affect the survivability of this accident.
8.
An enhanced ground proximity warning system (required by Federal regulation since
March 29, 2005), would have provided the pilots with a “too low terrain” alert in
sufficient time to avoid collision with the trees.
9.
Although the accident airplane’s 1,200 feet per minute (fpm) rate of descent was
consistent with company procedure, it varied from current Federal Aviation
Administration guidance that recommends a descent rate of no more than 1,000 fpm
below 1,000 feet above ground level.
10. The pilots failed to follow established procedures to effectively monitor the airplane’s
descent rate and height above terrain during the later stages of the approach and relied
too much on minimal external visual cues. Although descent rate and altitude
information were readily available through cockpit instruments, both pilots were
largely preoccupied with looking for the approach lights. Conclusions
57
Aircraft Accident Report
11. The pilots’ nonessential conversation below 10,000 feet mean sea level was contrary
to established sterile cockpit regulations and reflected a demeanor and cockpit
environment that fostered deviation from established standard procedures, crew
resource management disciplines, division of duties, and professionalism, reducing
the margin of safety well below acceptable limits during the accident approach and
likely contributing to the pilots’ degraded performance.
12. Compliance with sterile cockpit rules may have resulted in an increased focus on
standard procedures and professionalism during the accident flight.
13. The captain should have, but did not, arrest the airplane’s rapid descent when they
reached the minimum descent altitude (MDA), and the first officer should have, but
did not, challenge the captain’s descent below the MDA.
14. The use of a constant-angle-of-descent approach technique, with its resultant
stabilized, moderate rate-of-descent flightpath, and obstacle clearance, would have
better positioned the accident airplane for a successful approach and landing.
15. Current regulations permitting pilots to descend below the minimum descent altitude
(MDA) into a region where obstacle clearance is not assured may result in reduced
margins of safety for nonprecision approaches, especially in conditions of low
ceilings, reduced visibility, and/or at night.</div>

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] Both pilots’ attitudes and inattention during
subsequent operations demonstrated a lack of regard/respect for their responsibilities and
duties. Despite the pilots’ unprofessional verbal behavior throughout much of the flight,
CVR, FDR, ATC, and radar information indicated that they were generally attentive to
required flight-related duties until shortly before the accident. For example, the pilots
were very attentive to the weather conditions (low ceilings and reduced visibility) at IRK,
checking and rechecking the IRK ASOS observations as they approached the airport. Additionally, the captain provided a thorough landing briefing in which he stated the
MDA and runway TDZE (1,320 and 964 feet, respectively) and reviewed the missed
approach procedures. He also restated the MDA as he began the approach. However, despite their apparent awareness of proper approach procedures and
altitudes, the pilots continued their 1,200 fpm descent below the MDA without an
appropriate visual reference. The captain should have leveled off and focused on the flight
instruments and the first officer should have instructed him to level off. It was apparent
that they did not have the requisite visual cues needed to descend further at that time. Instead, about 2 seconds after the airplane descended through the MDA, still descending
about 1,200 fpm, the captain asked the first officer, “what do you think?” About 4 seconds
later, the first officer responded, “I can’t see [expletive].”
Corporate Airlines’ procedures dictated that the first officer was to monitor the
approach and report deviations from standard company approach procedures. During the
accident approach, the first officer occasionally provided the captain with appropriate
nonflying/monitoring pilot support (such as when he prompted the approach checklist,
provided DME callouts, repeated the MDA altitude, and prompted landing flaps).
However, there were several instances in which the first officer failed to provide
company-required callouts or provided nonstandard callouts. For example, he was
required to callout “100 feet above minimums” and “minimums,” as the airplane
descended through those altitudes, but instead he made a single callout of “thirteen
twenty” as the airplane approached the MDA. Most significantly, the first officer did not
challenge the captain’s failure to level off at or reduce the airplane’s rate of descent around
the MDA, despite the fact that the first officer did not see any ground references and was
responsible for monitoring the progress of the approach.110
110 The Safety Board notes that careful adherence to standard procedures and division of responsibility
in the cockpit can significantly help pilots limit the degrading effects of fatigue. The role of fatigue in this
accident is discussed in section 2.5. Analysis

Aircraft Accident Report
The first officer appeared to be engaged in appropriate nonflying/monitoring pilot
activities during the later stages of the approach; he was looking for external visual
references and stated, “in sight, continue” when he eventually observed the approach
lights (about 11 seconds after the airplane descended through the MDA). He also
prompted the captain regarding the landing flap configuration late in the approach.</div>

example, a sociological study of the Space Shuttle Challenger accident identified an 
incremental loosening of safety standards and “normalization of deviance,” whereby 
program managers accepted greater and greater anomalies in the performance of 
O-rings on the shuttle’s solid rocket boosters until an O-ring catastrophically failed in 
flight. According to this study, “slight deviations became the norm, providing a basis 
for accepting additional deviance” (Vaughan 1996). Also, a sociological analysis of a 
1994 accidental shootdown of U.S. Black Hawk helicopters over northern Iraq also 
identified sources of drift in operating practices that resulted in the “slow, steady 
uncoupling of local practice from written procedure” (Snook 2002).

Aviation Investigation Report 
NTSB/AIR-22-05 
 
52 
Further, in the NTSB’s analysis of a 2014 runway overrun accident involving a 
Gulfstream G-IV in Bedford, Massachusetts, we found that the flight crew’s habitual 
noncompliance with checklists likely resulted from procedural drift. In our 
investigation report, we expressed concern that, without adequate oversight or safety 
assurance mechanisms, pilots who fly together for years may begin to skip required 
checks in the service of non-safety goals, develop new group norms about what is 
expected, and develop an increasing mismatch between written guidance and 
operating practice (NTSB 2015). 
For the accident pilot, neither Safari nor the FAA had any record (such as a 
reprimand or violation) that he had previously flown in weather conditions that were 
below company and FAA minimums. However, Safari did not have any safety 
assurance processes for performing reviews of the accident pilot’s flights (discussed 
in section 2.5), and the Honolulu FSDO was limited in its ability to provide direct 
surveillance of air tours to ensure pilots’ compliance with minimum visibility 
requirements (discussed in section 2.6). Thus, it is unclear how Safari or the FAA 
would have known whether any previous noncompliance had occurred. In this investigation, the continuation of flights by the accident pilot and others 
who encountered weather conditions below the prescribed minimums on the day of 
the accident raises a concern about the possibility of procedural drift among the local 
air tour pilot community. For example, although the Company 1 pilots diverted their 
tours while flying in Waimea Canyon rather than continue north to the Nāpali Coast, 
they subsequently approached the Nāpali Coast from the east (from Hanalei Bay) and 
entered areas of reduced visibility and rain. Also, the Company 2 pilot entered reduced visibility conditions north of 
Waimea Canyon before taking action to divert, and he subsequently entered areas of 
visible moisture along the Nāpali Coast after approaching it from the east.</div>

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] Another possibility is that the pilot accurately assessed the conditions but still 
chose to fly into an area of deteriorating weather, which would indicate a deficiency 
in the action selection stage of decision-making. Risk perception can play a role in 
decision errors at the action selection stage (Goh and Wiegmann 2001). A study of 
general aviation pilots suggests that pilots may have lower levels of risk awareness 
and higher than average self-appraisals of skill and judgment in flying, suggesting the 
potential for overconfidence (O’Hare 1990). Traffic safety studies indicate that drivers 
also tend to be unrealistically optimistic when judging their driving competency and 
that this has implications for their perceptions of driving risk and willingness to

Aviation Investigation Report 
NTSB/AIR-22-05 
 
51 
engage in high-risk driving behaviors (DeJoy 1989, Mairean and Havârneanu 2018); 
the same could be true for pilots. Although the accident pilot was described by most as safety conscious and 
having good judgment when it came to weather, one pilot stated that the accident 
pilot, due to his high level of expertise, sometimes flew closer to adverse weather 
than more novice or more conservative pilots. This statement suggests that the 
accident pilot may have felt comfortable relying on his own judgment to decide 
whether an area of deteriorating weather that did not meet FAA requirements was a 
hazard to avoid. Maintaining the minimum 3-mile visibility required by the HATCPM (which is 
substantially more conservative than the minimum visibility required for standard Part 
135 helicopter flights) and Safari’s procedures would have provided the accident 
pilot ample opportunity to avoid entering hazardous weather conditions. His 
continuation of the flight into deteriorating weather north of Waimea Canyon until the 
accident occurred suggests the possibility that he may have been overconfident in his 
ability to transition safely through an area of poor visibility conditions. Safety theorists posit that work as described in written policies and procedures 
often differs from work as performed by operators (Dekker 2006). This gap between 
the prescribed procedures and the manner in which the operator actually performs 
the work is presumed to exist because workload and economic goals incentivize 
operators to routinely adapt safety-related procedures to keep systems functioning 
(Reason 1997, Rasmussen 1997). According to the theory, the magnitude of this gap 
between “work as imagined” and “work as performed” varies over time, and 
operating practices can, under some circumstances, deviate beyond safe boundaries 
through a process known as “procedural drift,” a term that reflects the insidious 
nature of the change (Johnston 2003). 
Procedural drift has been discussed in analyses of various accidents.</div>

3. Conclusions 3.1 Findings 
1. None of the following safety issues were identified for the accident flight: 
(1) pilot qualification deficiencies or impairment due to medical condition, 
alcohol, other drugs, or fatigue; (2) helicopter malfunction or failure; or 
(3) pressure on the pilot from other Safari Aviation Inc. managers to 
complete the flight. 
2. The accident pilot continued the tour flight into an area of deteriorating 
weather until he encountered instrument meteorological conditions and 
lost adequate visual references. 
3. Due to the lack of information about the helicopter’s flight track or any 
other parameters, it could not be determined whether the accident pilot 
maintained controlled flight after encountering instrument meteorological 
conditions or lost control of the helicopter before it struck terrain. 
4. The pilot’s decision to continue the flight into deteriorating visibility was 
likely influenced by a lack of relevant weather information and an atypical 
weather pattern and may have been influenced by the possibilities that he 
inadequately assessed the weather conditions in flight or was 
overconfident in his abilities. 
5. Considering that at least three other tour flights entered reduced visibility 
conditions on the day of the accident, it is possible that procedural drift 
toward risky weather-related operating practices existed among pilots of 
the local air tour community. 
6. As a result of the Federal Aviation Administration‘s (FAA) lack of leadership 
and expert guidance in developing cue-based weather training for air tour 
operators in Hawaii, Safari Aviation Inc.’s pilot training program, which was 
approved by the Honolulu flight standards district office, did not provide 
Safari’s pilots with the type of training that the FAA’s cue-based training 
research determined was effective for improving pilots’ skills for accurately 
assessing and avoiding hazardous in-flight weather conditions. 
7. Although Safari Aviation Inc. had a policy that defined company 
expectations for pilot adherence to minimum weather requirements, it did

Aviation Investigation Report 
NTSB/AIR-22-05 
 
94 
not have adequate safety assurance processes to assess whether company 
strategies to reduce pilots’ risk of inadvertent encounters with instrument 
meteorological conditions were effective. 
8. The Federal Aviation Administration’s full implementation of a Hawaii 
weather camera system as planned will provide access to continuously 
updated weather imagery that will support pilots’ weather-avoidance 
decision-making and likely reduce weather-related air tour accidents in the 
state. 
9. Now that the first aviation weather cameras are operational in Hawaii, the 
ability for en route pilots to obtain essential information from ground 
support personnel, such as flight service station specialists, based on the 
cameras’ imagery is particularly relevant due to the rapidly changing 
weather conditions on the islands.

3. Conclusions 3.1 Findings 
1. None of the following safety issues were identified for the accident flight: (1) pilot 
qualification deficiencies or impairment due to medical condition, alcohol, other drugs, or 
fatigue; (2) helicopter malfunction or failure; or (3) pressure on the pilot from Island 
Express Helicopters Inc., the air charter broker, or the client to complete the flight. 
2. Although the air traffic controller’s failure to report the loss of radar contact and radio 
communication with the accident flight was inconsistent with air traffic control procedures, 
this deficiency did not contribute to the accident or affect its survivability. 
3. Had the pilot completed an updated flight risk analysis form for the accident flight that 
considered the weather information available at the time the flight departed, the flight 
would have remained within the company’s low-risk category but would have required the 
pilot to seek input from the director of operations and to provide an alternative plan. 
4. At the time that the pilot took action to initiate a climb, the helicopter had already begun 
penetrating clouds, and the pilot lost visual reference to the horizon and the ground. The 
loss of outside visual reference was possibly intermittent at first but likely complete by the 
time the flight began to enter the left turn that diverged from its route over US Route 101. 
5. The pilot’s poor decision to fly at an excessive airspeed for the weather conditions was 
inconsistent with his adverse-weather-avoidance training and reduced the time available 
for him to choose an alternative course of action to avoid entering instrument 
meteorological conditions. 
6. The pilot experienced spatial disorientation while climbing the helicopter in instrument 
meteorological conditions, which led to his loss of helicopter control and the resulting 
collision with terrain. 
7. The pilot’s decision to continue the flight into deteriorating weather conditions was likely 
influenced by his self-induced pressure to fulfill the client’s travel needs, his lack of an 
alternative plan, and his plan continuation bias, which strengthened as the flight neared the 
destination. 
8. Island Express Helicopters Inc.’s lack of a documented policy and safety assurance 
evaluations to ensure that its pilots were consistently and correctly completing the flight 
risk analysis forms hindered the effectiveness of the form as a risk management tool. 
9. A fully implemented, mandatory safety management system could enhance Island Express 
Helicopters Inc.’s ability to manage risks. 
10. The use of appropriate simulation devices in scenario-based helicopter pilot training has 
the potential to improve pilots’ abilities to accurately assess weather and make appropriate 
weather-related decisions. NTSB

11. Objective research to evaluate spatial disorientation simulation technologies may help 
determine which applications are most effective for training pilots to recognize the onset 
of spatial disorientation and successfully mitigate it.

air traffic controllers at BUR and VNY during the flight included an overcast ceiling at 1,100 ft agl 
and visibility of 2.5 miles with haze. At 0944:34 (about 2 minutes before the accident), while the helicopter was flying west at 
an altitude of about 1,370 ft msl (450 ft agl) over US 101 and rising terrain, the pilot announced to 
an ATC facility that he was initiating a climb to get the helicopter “above the [cloud] layers,” and 
the helicopter immediately began climbing at a rate of about 1,500 fpm. About the same time, the 
helicopter began a gradual left turn, and its flight path generally continued to follow US 101 below. About 36 seconds later and while still climbing, the helicopter began to turn more tightly to the 
left, and its flight path diverged from its overflight of US 101. The helicopter reached an altitude of about 2,370 ft msl (about 1,600 ft agl) at 0945:15, 
then it began to descend rapidly in a left turn to the ground. At 0945:17 (while the helicopter was 
descending), the air traffic controller asked the pilot to “say intentions,” and the pilot replied that 
the flight was climbing to 4,000 ft msl. A witness near the accident site first heard the helicopter 
then saw it emerge from the bottom of the cloud layer in a left-banked descent about 1 or 2 seconds 
before impact. The following analysis discusses the accident sequence and evaluates the following safety 
issues: 
• The pilot’s preflight weather and flight risk planning (section 2.2.1); 
• The flight’s entry into IMC (section 2.2.2), and the pilot’s inadequate adverse weather 
avoidance (section 2.2.2.2); 
• The pilot’s spatial disorientation (section 2.2.3); 
• Factors influencing the pilot’s decision to continue the flight into adverse weather, 
including his self-induced pressure, lack of an alternate plan, and plan continuation bias 
(section 2.3); 
• Island Express’ incomplete implementation of its SMS (section 2.4), including its lack 
of safety assurance evaluations, such as those that could have ensured the effectiveness 
of the flight risk analysis forms (section 2.4.1); 
• The benefits of a mandatory SMS (section 2.4.2);

• The benefits of flight simulation devices for pilot training in adverse weather avoidance 
(section 2.5); 
• The benefits of a flight data monitoring (FDM) program (section 2.6); and 
• The value of crash-resistant flight recorder systems in preventing future accidents 
(section 2.7). 
Having completed a comprehensive review of the circumstances that led to the accident, 
the investigation identified none of the following safety issues for the accident flight: 
• Pilot qualification deficiencies or impairment due to medical condition, alcohol, other 
drugs, or fatigue.</div>

before a flight and any time there was a significant change in weather, this expectation was not 
contained in any company guidance, and the accident pilot did not complete a new form before 
departing from SNA. (See section 2.4.1 for further discussion about company oversight of the 
flight risk analysis forms.) 
Per the flight risk analysis form, visibility below 3 miles (a nine-point risk item) would 
require the pilot to call the DO to discuss the weather, and en route SVFR (an eight-point risk item) 
would require the pilot to list an alternative plan for the flight. Thus, the NTSB concludes that, had 
the pilot completed an updated flight risk analysis form for the accident flight that considered the 
weather information available at the time the flight departed, the flight would have remained within 
the company’s low-risk category but would have required the pilot to seek input from the DO and 
to provide an alternative plan. The role of a lack of an alternative plan in the pilot’s 
decision-making process is discussed in section 2.3. 
2.2.2 Flight’s Entry into Instrument Meteorological Conditions 
2.2.2.1 Regional Weather Conditions and Localized Phenomena 
The pilot had flown the same passengers to the same destination the previous morning, 
having been able to fly a more direct route from SNA to CMA and at a higher altitude. However, 
on the day of the accident, an unusually thick marine layer was present across the region, such that

36 
clouds associated with it extended up to 2,400 to 2,500 ft msl. Further, near-surface relative 
humidity near the accident site was still 100% at 1000, whereas it usually decreased earlier. In the 
type of low-level weather environment that existed that day, the cloud bases may not have been 
distinct (that is, the locations of the bases were not easy to visually identify). Also, the altitudes of 
the cloud bases likely would have varied across the area. As described previously, the flight’s departure from SNA and its progress through the BUR 
and VNY airspace en route to CMA were uneventful. At 0942:45 (about 3 minutes before the 
accident), the helicopter reached US 101 and began to follow it west toward CMA at an altitude 
of about 1,400 ft msl (550 ft agl) and groundspeed of about 140 kts.</div>

2.3.3 Decision to Continue Mission 
Before the accident flight, when the pilot first arrived in the search area about 2200, he 
flew the helicopter between 1,100 and 1,200 ft msl, which suggests that the cloud ceiling was at 
least 650 to 750 ft agl about the time that he landed at the remote rescue location. However, the 
altitude that the pilot initially flew during the accident flight was about 700 ft msl (250 ft agl), 
suggesting that the cloud ceiling and/or visibility in the area had deteriorated significantly during 
the time the helicopter was on the ground. In addition, weather information and witness reports 
indicate a strong possibility of icing. The safest course of action at this point was to perform a precautionary landing. An 
examination of the terrain along the helicopter’s ground track identified several open areas that 
could have served as emergency landing areas for the helicopter. However, due to the changing 
precipitation and low lighting conditions, it is uncertain whether the pilot could see these 
potential landing areas well enough to determine whether they were suitable for landing. Although it is possible that the condition of the snowmobiler created a sense of urgency 
that prompted the pilot to push on in deteriorating conditions, there is insufficient evidence about 
the seriousness of the snowmobiler’s medical condition to know how it might have been 
perceived by the pilot and flight observer. Although the flight observer reported to a dispatcher 
that the snowmobiler was hypothermic, he did not communicate any detailed information about 
the snowmobiler’s condition, and hypothermia cases can range from mild to severe. A factor that likely influenced the pilot’s continued VFR flight in deteriorating weather 
was his high motivation for performing missions and accomplishing rescues. Although the pilot 
was described by colleagues as being very safety oriented, the aircraft section commander had 
expressed concern to the pilot about the riskiness of some flights, and the pilot had responded 
that he agreed to do such things when he was hired and planned to continue doing them. As a 
result of his conversations with the pilot, the aircraft section commander said he believed the 
pilot appreciated the hazards associated with risky decisions but that he felt a self-imposed 
obligation to take certain risks to accomplish rescues. Another factor that likely influenced the pilot’s continued VFR flight into deteriorating 
weather was an increased tolerance for risk as a result of successful past outcomes. Although the 
pilot had experienced a takeoff accident 7 years earlier involving white-out conditions and loss 
of visibility from snowfall and snow on the ground that billowed up in the rotor wash, he had not 
experienced any other accidents since, despite conducting additional missions that often involved 
high-risk activities, such as maneuvering through areas of poor weather at night and flying 
inches above fast-moving bore tides. The success of these past missions, particularly those 
involving poor weather, likely increased the pilot’s confidence that he could safely continue VFR 
flight at night in marginal weather conditions.</div>

or ground resources could assist them.58 Executing a landing in the dark, reduced-visibility 
conditions in an unfamiliar clearing with heavy snow on the ground might also damage the 
helicopter. Continuing VFR flight, on the other hand, increased the pilot’s risk of experiencing a 
weather-related accident, but the risk of this type of accident probably seemed remote to the 
pilot, given his past experience. Thus, the pilot had to choose between two undesirable 
alternatives: one that involved a high perceived likelihood of inconvenience and possible 
helicopter damage and another that involved a low perceived likelihood of a serious accident. The pilot chose the latter option, and the risk of a serious accident was realized. The NTSB 
concludes that the pilot’s exceptionally high motivation for SAR missions and past successes 
likely increased his risk tolerance and influenced his decision to continue flying in deteriorating 
weather conditions and risk a weather-related accident rather than accept the certain 
inconveniences and potential hazards associated with a precautionary landing. 
2.4 Organizational Issues 
2.4.1 Risk Assessment 
The accident helicopter was a single-engine, nonIFR-certified platform and was crewed 
by a single pilot who was not instrument-current and had NVGs. This meant that the 
equipment/crew pairing was capable of operating in dark night VMC conditions but not in IMC. Inadvertent encounters with IMC would result in a high risk. One prudent organizational strategy 
for managing this risk should have entailed establishing minimum VFR weather requirements 
that provide some degree of separation between the helicopter and weather conditions that could 
obscure a pilot’s view of the natural horizon, with or without NVGs. However, as discussed 
previously, the Alaska DPS did not apply across-the-board VFR weather minimums to its 
helicopter pilots, other than FAA requirements. The Part 91 regulations that applied to Alaska DPS flights required only that the 
helicopter be operated clear of clouds below 1,200 ft. In contrast, for HEMS operations 
conducted under Part 135, the FAA established NVG weather minimums. These minimums, 
which are part of a HEMS-specific operations specification, range from an 800-ft ceiling and 
3-mi visibility for a local flight in nonmountainous terrain to a 1,000-ft ceiling and 5-mi visibility 
for cross-country flights in mountainous terrain.</div>

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] According to images from 
the Appareo unit, the pilot used his NVGs during the entire flight and had configured the 
Garmin 296 GPS, which was in the “track up” orientation, to show a magenta course line that 
extended southwest on the map display. The pilot did not make any adjustments to the 
Garmin 430 GPS unit (including not slaving it to the HSI) or the Avalex system, and the 
turn-and-bank indicator remained disabled for the flight. Three min after takeoff, the trooper 
radioed the dispatcher that the helicopter was en route back to Sunshine, and he requested that an 
ambulance meet the flight to receive the hypothermic snowmobiler. No further radio 
communications were received from the flight. After takeoff, the pilot initially climbed the helicopter to an altitude of about 700 ft msl 
(about 250 ft agl in that area) and flew it southwest for about 1 min at a 60-knot groundspeed 
then southeast for about 1 min. This course allowed the pilot to fly around a 1,000-ft-high hill 
while remaining below the cloud ceiling. At times, the helicopter slowed to about 20 knots and 
flew as low as about 100 ft agl. The helicopter’s subsequent climb and acceleration over the Intertie, followed by its 
descent to less than 100 ft agl, deceleration to ground speeds as low as 27 knots, and circuitous 
route through a cluster of hills near the accident location indicate that the pilot likely encountered 
deteriorating weather conditions and responded by flying the helicopter closer to trees and terrain 
in an effort to maintain external visual references. As discussed previously, however, the 
helicopter likely encountered very low clouds and near-zero visibility conditions near the 
accident site, and these conditions likely degraded the pilot’s NVG image to the point where 
continued flight under VFR was impossible. The pilot was using a lip light throughout the accident flight, and this light was directed 
at knobs and buttons on the instrument panel when the pilot manipulated them. In addition, the 
movement of the lip light beam was suggestive of purposeful scanning inside the cockpit. Although it was not possible to determine when the pilot was looking through his NVGs rather 
than below them at the instrument panel, and, although it was not possible to determine where 
the pilot was looking within the beam of light when it was directed at a particular area of the 
instrument panel, the absence of the beam from the primary flight instruments was indicative of 
periods when he was not closely attending to them. Thus, the lip light provided some indication 
of the pilot’s visual attention inside the cockpit. NTSB 
Aircraft Accident Report 
48 
About 3 min into the flight, as the pilot encountered deteriorating weather and rising 
terrain, the pattern of the pilot’s lip light movement changed. Whereas the light had been 
frequently on and off the instrument panel, it was now lingering in other locations, primarily the 
lower right portion of the cockpit where the Garmin 296 was mounted.</div>

During the latter part of 1968 and the early
part of 1969, arash of serious aircraft accidents
occurred during the instrument approach phase
of flight. As a results of those accidents, the
National Transportation Safety Board. by letter
dated January 17, 1969, made a number of

recommendations to the Administrator of the
Federal Aviation Administration, Among others,
it recommended that the Administrator: emphasize the importance of altwude awareness
during instrument approaches through strict attention to instrument indications, ceew coordination, and altitude callout procedures.</div>

Board to examine the last portion of the approach. These sudies showed chat if the 15
knots tailwind ceased for 10 secands when the
aircraft passed through about 400 feet it would
result in a flight recorder trace similar to the one

obtained from the accident. Additionally, the
reduction in power to an Ny compressor speed
of 60 percent is a natural result of observing an
airspeed 10 knots higher than desired,

Witnesses varied in their evaluation of the
init&#x27;al impace attitude of the aircraft. One
witness stated that the aircraft struck the waver
in a noscup attivude, whercas other witnesses
described the aircre“e striking the water ia a
nosedown attitude, This variance in witness
obseivetions can be reconciled by the difference
in visual angles, distance from the impact area,
and the reduced visibility caused by the rain
shower in the area of the accident. The crew adhered closely to hzading and altitude instructions until level off upon reaching
Flying Tiger minimums (300 feet), Thereafter,
however, the aircraft descended through the
Decision Heignt and contacted che water. Accordingly, the investigation was directed toward
determining what factors may have led to this
unwarranted descent. The Safety Board has considered and ruled
out the following as possible mechanisms of
causation:

(1) In-flight failure, malfunction, or abnor-

mality that would have caused or contributed to an unwarranted rate of descent.

(2) An unauthorized person in the cockpit.

(3) Pilot fatigue.

(4, in-flight pilot incapacitation. The crewmembe:s were all performing their
duties and conversiug in normal tones until just
before the accident a-curred.

i: was determined fram the CVR that the first
officer flew the final approach ro Naha while the
captain handled the communications and maintained external reference. As the aircraft progressed into the rain
shower, the crew probably lost excernal visual
reference completely, dve to the intensity of the
rain, However, since the flight was nearing

approach minimums and they expected to break
out of the shower momentarily, the captaia
undoubtedly devoted his attention to locating
the approach lights. Durirg the 7-second period of level flight at
325 feet ms.i, the aircraft passed through the
most intense portion of the shower and emerged
into an area of increased light intensity. The

period the final approach controller advised the
crew that they were ‘“‘on glidepath” and had a
10 knot tailwind. The “on glidepath” transmission undoubtedly reassured the crew regarding their altitude and position. About 8 seconds «fer this ‘ton glidepath”
portion of the controller&#x27;s transmission, an
unidentified person in the cockpit (probably the
second officer) called out “hundred fect.” At
that point the flight recorder indicated an altitude of 85 feet m.s.. There was no evidence that
this call alarmed the captain or the first officer,
even though the radar aitimeters would have
indicated the alticude. The an:ber warning I&#x27;ghts
associated with these radar altimeter: would
have been lit also, since the captain’s reference
“bug” was set at 200 feet m.s.l. and the first
officer&#x27;s was set at 300 feet m.s.l. One-second after the “hundred feet&quot; call the
controller advised the flight: ‘‘at minimum altitude, going well below glidepath, too low...”
The CYR recording of the controller&#x27;s instre.-
tions ended at that point. While the final a¢-
proach controller was making that transmission,
the unidentified person in the cockpit was
calling, “Seventy feet&quot; and “It&#x27;s fifty fer.” If
the laccer calls alarmed the captain and/or the
first officer, it was too late to refocus on the
instruments, interprec them, and effect a recovery from the relatively high rate of descent

from touchdown) to 1435:37 (1 nule from
touchdown and 8.5 seconds prior to impact),

may have precluded an effective overall surveillance of other instruments, particularly the aleim.
eter. Thus, he may have been relying on the
controilet to provide altitude information. There was ao evidence that either the “500
feet above minimums” or ‘100 feet above mini.
imems’’ call, required by company directives,
was made. One possible explanation for the lack
of those calls is that the flight was in visual
conditions at both times, and consequently, the
pilots may not have regarded the calls necessary. Another explanation could be the lack of explicit written company directives as to crew
duties when the first officer is flying the aircraft
on an instrument approach. Also, there was an
evident lack of a clear understanding between
the pilots as to what the DH should be.</div>

at 1855 local time, almost 5 hours earlier. Weather information available to controllers is 
time-stamped, and the controller should have noticed that the report was outdated. The controller 
did not appear to have noticed the time discrepancy and did not advise the pilot of the age of the 
report or take any action to contact ADW for current weather information. During the time that 
the aircraft was being vectored for the approach, ADW was reporting wind from 110° at 3 knots, 
visibility 7 miles, cloud ceiling 1,300 broken, temperature 20° C, dew point 20 °C. Although 
these weather conditions were well above the localizer-only and ILS landing minimums for the 
runway 19R approaches, the cloud ceiling was 500 feet lower than that reported to Trooper 2. If 
the pilot had been given the current weather information, he would have expected to be unable to 
see the ground until he had reached a significantly lower altitude. Knowing that the ceiling was 
500 feet lower may have discouraged the pilot from attempting to duck under the cloud ceiling 
and resulted in his continuing the approach to the airport at a 500 fpm rate of descent. Therefore, 
the NTSB concludes that the failure of the PCT controller to provide the current ADW weather 
information likely led the pilot to expect that he could descend below the cloud ceiling and 
establish visual contact with the ground at an altitude well above the MDA for the approach. The controller did not explicitly issue Trooper 2 an instrument clearance or an IFR 
transponder code. An IFR transponder code is necessary for aircraft to receive MSAW service. When interviewed, he stated that the pilot never requested an instrument clearance, and the 
controller believed that the pilot wanted a VFR practice approach to ADW. As the pilot had 
requested IFR from DCA and there was no further discussion of VFR operations by either the 
pilot or the PCT controller after he was handed off, the pilot could have reasonably expected that 
he was operating under IFR despite not having received an explicit IFR clearance from PCT. The

NTSB

57 
controller&#x27;s statement that he believed Trooper 2 was VFR all the way to touchdown is 
contravened by the controller&#x27;s failure to restrict the aircraft to VFR operations as required by 
FAA directives. Between the time Trooper 2 contacted PCT and issuance of the IFR approach 
clearance, Trooper 2‘s status as an IFR or VFR flight was ambiguous. Once the helicopter was 
cleared for an approach without a VFR restriction, Trooper 2 was an IFR flight and should have 
been given an IFR transponder code.</div>

than reported. Regardless of the unavailability of the DoD surface weather observations, the pilot did 
have access to information that indicated the weather conditions were continuing to deteriorate 
throughout the evening. In addition to surface observations, the pilot could also have viewed 
terminal area forecasts and AIRMETs via the HEMS weather tool. He could have obtained the 
amended terminal forecast for DCA, issued at 1933, which indicated that weather conditions

were expected to deteriorate temporarily from VFR to IFR between 2000 and 2300 with the 
ceiling broken at 800 feet, overcast at 1,500 feet. Additionally, he could have obtained an 
AIRMET for IFR conditions issued at 2245 for an area that encompassed the entire route of 
Trooper 2. The forecast ceilings and visibilities in the DCA terminal forecast and in the 
AIRMET were above the MSP Aviation Command minimums for acceptance of a night 
medevac flight. However, the amendment to the DCA forecast and the issuance of the AIRMET 
indicated that weather conditions were continuing to deteriorate. Since HEMS weather tool data 
is not archived, it is not possible to determine what information was viewed by the pilot. It appears that the pilot based his decision to launch solely on the weather observations at 
College Park and DCA and the suitable conditions implied by the other medevac helicopter‘s 
completed flight. Other pertinent weather data—the low temperature/dew point spreads at ADW 
and College Park, the AIRMET for IFR conditions encompassing the route of flight, and the 
continuing deterioration of the weather conditions as the evening progressed—were either 
discounted by the pilot or not obtained. If the pilot had thoroughly obtained and reviewed all of 
the available weather information, it is likely he would have realized that there was a high 
probability of encountering weather conditions less than MSP minimums on the flight and this 
would have prompted him to decline the flight. Therefore, the NTSB concludes that the pilot‘s 
decision to accept the flight, after his inadequate assessment of the weather, contributed to the 
accident. According to the safety officer, at the time of the accident, MSP did not have a formal 
risk management program in place. He explained that there was optional guidance available to 
pilots in the form of a ―Risk Assessment Matrix.‖ However, review of the MSP Operations 
Manual revealed that it stated the flight crew ―will apply‖ the matrix and based on the risk 
assessment, increase visibility and ceiling minimums ―to the crew‘s comfort level prior to 
accepting the mission.‖ The matrix indicated that a temperature/dew point spread of less than 
2° C raised the flight risk from low to medium risk. Although the matrix indicated that no flights 
were to be made if the risk level was high, it provided no instructions concerning medium-risk 
flights. There is no evidence indicating that the accident pilot consulted the matrix before the 
flight.</div>

prompted the ADW controller to provide assistance, possibly including the ASR approach. Also, 
he could have executed a missed approach and attempted the ILS approach a second time to 
determine if the glideslope failure was a perceived failure or a legitimate one. Additionally, there 
were 11 other instrument approaches at ADW, any of which he could have requested. About 27 seconds after the controller stated that she was unable to provide an ASR 
approach, upon reaching an altitude of about 1,450 feet msl on the glideslope and at a distance of 
about 4.0 miles north of the runway threshold, the helicopter‘s rate of descent increased rapidly 
from about 500 feet per minute (fpm) to greater than 2,000 fpm. The helicopter continued the 
descent, passing through the MDA for the localizer approach (407 feet agl), the alert height set 
on the radar altimeter (300 feet agl), and the decision height for the ILS approach (200 feet agl), 
before impacting trees and terrain about 3.2 miles north of the runway threshold. Data recovered 
from the PAR computer indicate that the helicopter impacted with the engines near idle power, 
the main rotor system at 100 percent rpm, and an indicated airspeed of about 92 knots. No 
evidence was found to indicate that the pilot made any attempt to arrest the helicopter‘s descent 
before impact. The sudden increase in the helicopter‘s rate of descent may indicate that the pilot 
deliberately deviated from the approach procedure by attempting to ―duck under‖ the cloud layer 
to regain visual conditions. Several factors might have encouraged the pilot to attempt to ―duck 
under‖ the cloud ceiling. First, the outdated ADW weather report provided by the PCT controller 
indicated a ceiling of 1,800 feet and 7 miles visibility. Given these conditions, the pilot would 
have had a reasonable expectation that he could have descended below the cloud ceiling at an 
altitude well above the MDA for the approach. Second, the pilot was based at ADW and familiar with its visual environment. This likely 
would have given him confidence that he would be able to identify landmarks and quickly 
determine his position once he descended below the cloud ceiling. Third, a return to visual conditions would have relieved the pilot of the additional 
workload generated by instrument flight. All medical flights involve significant workload and 
time pressure to provide patients with timely service to medical aid. However, this flight 
involved unusually high workload once the pilot encountered instrument conditions. These 
conditions greatly increased the demands on the pilot since he had little recent experience in 
actual instrument flying. Additionally, the weather prevented him from reaching the planned 
medical center, forcing him to divert with the new responsibility of considering alternate 
transport arrangements for the patients along with his diversion considerations. Workload was 
further increased by the limited support he received from ATC, which included 
unresponsiveness, inefficient clearances to ADW, and an inability to provide a requested ASR 
approach. The NTSB therefore concludes that the pilot‘s workload increased substantially and 
unexpectedly as a result of encountering instrument weather conditions.</div>

during some of the pilot’s previous passenger-carrying flights from the lodge to the fishing camp 
revealed that the ceiling and visibility conditions reported at the time of the accident were better 
than what was reported at DLG during the flight performed the day before the accident. The 
NTSB concludes that the weather conditions forecasted for and observed in the area on the day 
of the accident did not appear to be exceptional compared to the conditions that the pilot 
experienced on previous flights. Thus, the accident pilot’s decision to depart on the accident 
flight appears to have been based on his own assessment that the weather had adequately 
improved to the extent that he felt comfortable making the flight. 
2.3.2 Situational Awareness and Spatial Disorientation 
Because of the likelihood of localized variations, the weather conditions encountered 
during the accident flight are not known. Also, the passengers’ descriptions of the weather vary. Three passengers stated that the flight was conducted below the cloud ceiling in VMC; however, 
two of those passengers fell asleep before the time of impact. Another passenger who first stated 
that he had no indication of weather subsequently changed his statement to indicate that he could 
see only “white-out” conditions outside the airplane. Based on interviews with other pilots who 
had flown with the accident pilot, continuing VFR flight into instrument meteorological 
conditions (IMC), either deliberately or inadvertently, would be considered uncharacteristic of 
the accident pilot. Had the visibility and ceilings for the accident flight been 5 miles or greater (similar to 
that which a Cessna 208 pilot reported in the area about 30 minutes before the accident), the 
rising terrain at Muklung Hills would have been visible to the pilot from the airplane’s last 
recorded Sky Connect position. However, had the visibility been 3 miles (similar to the 1455 
DLG observation of 3 miles visibility with light rain), Muklung Hills and the peaks that define 
the wide and narrow passes to the west would not have been visible to the pilot from the 
airplane’s last recorded position. Also, if a 1,000-foot overcast ceiling existed (similar to the 
1455 DLG observation), the peaks of Muklung Hills would have been obscured but the floor of 
the tundra may have been visible. In that case, the Muklung River, which crosses the tundra and 
flows through the wide pass, likely would have served as a prominent landmark. Although one 
passenger had noted that the pilot’s visual navigational methods appeared to include following 
streams, it is not known whether the pilot typically used the Muklung River as a visual reference 
to navigate to the wide pass.

fishing camp, showed that the accident flight’s route appeared to be the most northern and 
eastern route taken by the pilot by at least 1 nm (because of the interval of the data samples, the 
precise flight routes are not known). According to the passenger seated in the cockpit, the pilot 
had stated he was taking off in a different direction than usual because of weather. The wind was generally from the south-southwest, which would likely create turbulence 
over Lake Nerka, which was immediately downwind of higher terrain on the southwest shore of 
the lake. The GCI pilot with whom the accident pilot flew from the lodge to DLG that morning 
reported that the turbulence they encountered may have been a comfort issue for passengers, and 
the accident pilot, during his return trip from DLG to the lodge, reported (in the form of a 
PIREP) encountering “extremely irritating” turbulence. Thus, the apparent more northern and 
eastern positioning of the accident flight’s initial path may have been the result of an intentional 
pilot action to minimize the turbulence for the passengers. The Sky Connect position reports for the accident flight showed that, after taking off, the 
airplane was at an altitude of about 1,080 feet msl at one point and that, as it proceeded 
southeast, its next recorded altitudes were 780 feet msl and 920 feet msl (at the last point 
recorded). Flight at such changing altitudes would be consistent with the pilot maneuvering to 
remain in VMC below the clouds and suggests the possibility of variable cloud ceilings along the 
flight route. Although the initial accident flight route appeared to be offset to the north and east (when 
compared to the accident pilot’s previous routes to the fishing camp), the last recorded position 
and ground track for the airplane were such that, if that ground track were maintained, the 
airplane would have traveled through the wide pass west of the Muklung Hills (near the 
“MUKLG” GPS waypoint), which would be consistent with the pilot’s previous routes. However, the airplane instead tracked to the east and collided with terrain about 4 nm southeast 
of its last recorded position. Ground scar evidence from the accident site indicated that the airplane was traveling 
east-northeast when it impacted terrain. Thus, it was on a heading that pointed away from any 
relevant destination or previous flight track. An impact study that evaluated the airplane’s crush 
damage and the ground scar evidence determined that the airplane impacted terrain at a pitch 
attitude of about 17° airplane nose up and bank angle of about 30° left wing down.</div>

probable. The NTSB concludes that that the airplane was in a climbing left turn when it collided 
with terrain and that flight control inputs occurred shortly before terrain impact. Because only limited information was available, the sequence of events after the 
airplane’s last recorded position up to the moment of likely control input and terrain impact is 
unknown. FAA Advisory Circular 61-134, “General Aviation Controlled Flight into Terrain 
Awareness,” indicates that controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) occurs when “an airworthy 
aircraft is flown, under the control of a qualified pilot, into terrain (water or obstacles) with 
inadequate awareness on the part of the pilot of the impending collision.” Based on this 
definition, the circumstances of this accident could be consistent with a CFIT event if the 
accident pilot actively controlled the airplane but navigated inappropriately at some point after

the airplane’s last known position. However, the airplane performance study indicates that the 
airplane also could have reached the accident site if the pilot provided little or no input on the 
flight controls (that is, did not actively control the airplane, which would be inconsistent with a 
CFIT event) for a period of nearly 3 minutes after the airplane’s last known position and then 
made flight control inputs only in the moments before impact. Because none of the flightpath 
scenarios evaluated by the airplane performance study can be considered more probable or more 
compelling than another, the following human performance analysis discusses factors that could 
affect the pilot’s possible deliberate actions or explain his possible lack of action during the final 
3 minutes of the flight up to the final 4 to 6 seconds before impact. 
2.3 Human Performance 
The accident pilot’s reported experience included decades of flying in Alaska, with 
several years of flying in the vicinity of Lake Nerka and recent flight operations in the vicinity of 
the accident area. Several pilots who were professional and personal acquaintances of the 
accident pilot described him as a pilot who had excellent stick-and-rudder skills, exceptional 
knowledge of the Alaska area and terrain, and an innate sense of situational awareness. 
2.3.1 Challenges Inherent in the Alaska Flying Environment 
The NTSB has had a longstanding interest in the safety of aviation operations in Alaska. In a 1995 safety study,82 the NTSB noted that flight operations83 in Alaska are subject to a 
challenging aviation environment. Rough terrain and adverse weather can increase the risks to 
safe flight operations, particularly for flights conducted under VFR.</div>

not adequately prepared to perform ASE’s instrument and missed approach procedures. In addition, Avjet’s manual indicates that the captain was to brief the airplane’s 
configuration and approach speed, final approach fix altitude, minimum descent altitude 
(MDA), visual descent point, circling maneuver, runway information, and abnormal 
conditions. The CVR did not record the captain briefing any of this information. While the airplane was descending into the terminal area, the flight crew 
attempted to locate a specific highway because a visual approach to the airport follows 
parallel to this highway, but that effort was mostly unsuccessful. Afterward, the captain 
informed the approach controller, “I can almost see up the canyon from here but I don’t 
know the terrain well enough or I’d take the visual.” The controller acknowledged this 
information and provided the flight crew with instructions for intercepting the final 
approach course. According to Doppler weather radar and weather satellite information, the cloud 
tops were near 16,000 feet while the airplane was on approach to ASE. After descending 
through this altitude, the airplane was in and out of the clouds. 
 
 
47 The AFSS specialist did not read the NOTAM verbatim and told the first officer that circling 
minimums were not authorized at night. The addition of the word “minimums” made the information 
conform somewhat closer to the intent of the NOTAM because the NOTAM modified the VOR/DME-C 
procedure and not the landing maneuver. 
48 As stated in the “History of Flight” section, the sample flight plans provided by Gulfstream 
showed that the amount of fuel aboard the accident airplane would have exceeded the amount required by 
the Federal Aviation Regulations. NTSB/AAB-02/03

Execution of the Instrument Approach Procedure 
 
According to the intent of the NOTAM, the instrument approach procedure to 
ASE was not authorized after 1855. As a result, the flight crew should not have been 
attempting this procedure to the airport. The CVR did not record any discussion between 
the flight crewmembers about the NOTAM. However, the flight crew was likely not 
aware that official nighttime began 3 minutes before the 1858 landing restriction at ASE. Also, the flight crewmembers might have believed that the NOTAM, because of its 
unclear wording, did not apply to a flight that would not have to execute a circling 
maneuver to runway 15. If the FAA had worded the NOTAM more clearly (as in the 
revision issued the day after the accident), it might have made more of an impression on 
the first officer when he received the preflight briefing from the Hawthorne AFSS and 
might have affected the conduct of the flight. Finally, it is also possible that the first 
officer did not brief the captain about the NOTAM and, therefore, that the captain might 
not have been aware of the NOTAM. About 1856:06, the approach controller cleared the flight crew for the 
VOR/DME-C instrument approach procedure. The controller did not know about the 
NOTAM because the Denver Center had not sent a copy to the ASE tower.</div>

• The presence of a passenger on the jumpseat, especially if it were the 
charter customer, most likely further heightened the pressure on the flight 
crew to land at ASE. 
 
4. Darkness, reduced visibility, and light snow showers near the airport at 
the time of the accident significantly degraded the flight crew’s ability to 
see and safely avoid terrain. 
 
5. The March 27, 2001, Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) regarding the 
nighttime restriction on the VOR/DME-C approach was vaguely worded 
and ineffectively distributed. 
 
• The NOTAM stated, “circling NA [not authorized] at night,” but the 
intended meaning of the NOTAM was to prohibit the entire instrument 
approach procedure at night. 
• Pilots might have inferred that an approach without a circle-to-land 
maneuver to runway 15 was still authorized. 
• If the FAA had worded the first NOTAM more clearly, it might have 
made more of an impression on the first officer when he received the 
preflight briefing from the Automated Flight Service Station and might 
have affected the conduct of the flight. 
• The local controller could not notify the flight crew of the NOTAM 
because the Denver Center had not sent a copy to the ASE tower. PROBABLE CAUSE 
 
The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of 
this accident was the flight crew’s operation of the airplane below the minimum descent 
altitude without an appropriate visual reference for the runway. Contributing to the cause of the accident were the Federal Aviation 
Administration’s (FAA) unclear wording of the March 27, 2001, Notice to Airmen 
regarding the nighttime restriction for the VOR/DME-C approach to the airport and the 
FAA’s failure to communicate this restriction to the Aspen tower; the inability of the 
flight crew to adequately see the mountainous terrain because of the darkness and the 
weather conditions; and the pressure on the captain to land from the charter customer and 
because of the airplane’s delayed departure and the airport’s nighttime landing restriction.</div>

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] As a result, the dark conditions would have significantly degraded the flight crew’s 
ability to see and safely avoid terrain while making the visual transition from the 
instrument approach to an intended landing. The reduced visibility and light snow 
showers near the airport would have further degraded the flight crew’s ability to see and 
safely avoid the terrain. This accident reveals that the aeronautical definition of night does not adequately 
take into account darkness in mountainous terrain. Specifically, because pilots do not 
have sufficient ambient lighting to see and safely avoid unlighted terrain during periods 
of darkness before official night, the night restriction on the VOR/DME-C approach is 
not enough to ensure safety of flight. Thus, nighttime restrictions may not sufficiently 
mitigate potential hazards associated with flight operations into ASE and other airports 
with mountainous terrain during periods of darkness.61 
 
60 On February 21, 2002, an ASE tower controller observed the sun fully set behind the terrain 
about 1725. At that time, the elevation of the sun was 4.2º, resulting in a visible sunset that was about 26 
minutes earlier than the official sunset of 1751. On the night of the accident, the sun was at an elevation of 
4.2º about 1803, resulting in a visible sunset that was about 25 minutes earlier than official sunset. 
61 To address this issue, the Safety Board issued Safety Recommendation A-02-08 on April 15, 
2002. Safety Recommendation A-02-08 asked the FAA to “revise any restrictions and prohibitions that 
currently reference or address ‘night’ or ‘nighttime’ flight operations in mountainous terrain so that those 
restrictions and prohibitions account for the entire potential period of darkness or insufficient ambient light 
conditions, and establish a method to clearly communicate to flight crews when such restrictions and 
prohibitions apply.”

SUMMARY 
 
1. The flight crew made numerous procedural errors and deviations during 
the final approach segment of the VOR/DME approach to Aspen (ASE). 
 
• The flight crew crossed step-down fixes below the minimum specified 
altitudes. 
• The flight crew descended below the minimum descent altitude (MDA), 
even though airplane maneuvers and comments on the cockpit voice 
recorder (CVR) indicated that neither pilot had established or maintained 
visual contact with the runway or its environment. 
• Contrary to the airplane manufacturer’s procedures, the captain deployed 
the spoilers after the landing gear had been extended and the final landing 
flaps had been selected, and he set engine power to 55 percent N2 rather 
than 64 percent N2. 
• When the airplane was 1.4 miles from the runway (about 21 seconds 
before the accident), the captain asked, “where’s it at?” but did not 
abandon the approach, even though he had not identified, or had lost 
visual contact with, the runway. 
• Radar data and CVR comments indicated that, until the airplane began 
turning to the left about 10 seconds before the accident, the flight crew 
probably did not have the runway or its environment in sight. 
 
2. The crew demonstrated poor crew coordination during the accident 
flight. 
 
• The captain did not discuss the instrument approach procedure, the missed 
approach procedure, and other required elements during his approach 
briefing because he expected to execute a visual approach to the airport. 
• The captain and the first officer did not make required instrument 
approach callouts, and the first officer did not call out required course, fix, 
and altimeter information. 
• The flight crew did not discuss a missed approach after receiving a third 
report of a missed approach to the airport and a report of deteriorating 
visibility in the direction of the approach course. 
 
3. The flight crew was under pressure to land at ASE. 
 
• Because of the flight’s delayed departure from Los Angeles International 
Airport and the landing curfew at ASE, the flight crew could attempt only 
one approach to the airport before having to divert to the alternate airport. 
• The charter customer had a strong desire to land at ASE, and his 
communications before and during the flight most likely heightened the 
pressure on the flight crew.</div>

1.18 New Investigative Techniques

None 2. ANALYSIS

The flightcrew was properly certificated and trained in
accordance with applicable regulations. There was no evidence of preexisting medical problems that might have affected the flightcrew&#x27;s
performance. The aircraft was certificated and equipped according to
applicable regulations. The gross weight and c.g. were within prescribed
limits. The aircraft&#x27;s structure and components were not factors in
this accident. There was no evidence of any malfunction of the aircraft
or its control system. The propulsion system was operating and was
producing power until fuel was exhausted. The right engine had been
malfunctioning for some time and caused the flightcrew to operate that
engine on auto-rich fuel mixture during the accident flight and. during
previous flights in order to obtain an acceptable level of performance
from it. Although examination of the engine and its components did not
identify the exact discrepancy, the Safety Board believes that the
discrepancy was of a general nature, such as an ignition or induction
problem, and was not a major mechanical failure. Components of the
right engine&#x27;s ignition system were so badly damaged by impact that
engine to distributor timing could not be determined. Consequently, the
pre-impact condition of the ignition system could not be determined from
the evidence available. Based on wreckage examination, the Safety Board concludes that
both engines ceased producing power because of fuel exhaustion. Only
one quart of fuel was recovered from both engines. Evidence obtained
from the fuel quantity gages indicates that both fuel tanks were empty
at the time of impact. According to the best estimates, the aircraft should have had
about 207 gallons of fuel on board at the time of the accident. This
figure is based on a normal cruise configuration with both engines
operating with &quot;auto-lean&quot; fuel mixture. In order to determine the reason for the discrepancy between
calculated fuel on board and actual fuel on board, the Safety Board
analyzed the following three explanations:

First, there could have been a fuel leak. However, no evidence
of fuel leakage, such as stains or loose fuel tank caps or lines, was
found in the wreckage. Although this possibility cannot be discounted
completely, because there is a remote possibility that leakage evidence
could have been obliterated at impact, the Safety Board does not believe
it to be the most viable explanation. Secondly, the aircraft may not have been fueled with the
amount shown on the fuel slips. The Safety Board considers this explanation
relatively remote because the fuel meters on refueling trucks cannot be
reset and, if functioning properly, will reflect the total amount of
fuel dispensed to a given aircraft. Finally, the engines or an engine could have been burning more
fuel than specified and more than the flightcrew expected to be burned.</div>

3. CONCLUSIONS’ 3.1 Findings

l. Both engines of N55VM ceased to produce power because
the aircraft&#x27;s useable fuel supply was exhausted.

2. The crew failed to monitor adequately the fuel flow,
en route fuel consumption, and fuel quantity gages.

3. The crew failed to take appropriate preflight and
maintenance action to assure an adequate fuel supply for
the flight.

4, The crew operated the aircraft for an indeterminate
amount of time before the accident with the right
engine&#x27;s mixture control in the auto-rich position.

-~ 16 -

5. There were no discernible discrepancies between the
amounts of fuel added to the aircraft and the amounts
shown on the fuel receipts from the servicing facilities.

6. There was no evidence of a fuel leak.

7. There was no fire after impact because little
fuel remained in the aircraft&#x27;s fuel system.

8. The survival of many passengers was due to the lack
of severe impact deformation in the center of the
fuselage and the absence of a postcrash fire.

9. The provisions of the lease intended to satisfy the
requirement for a &quot;truth in leasing clause&quot; did not
result in this lessee having an adequate understanding
as to who was the operator of this flight and what that
means. 3.2 Probable Cause

The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the
probable cause of this accident was fuel exhaustion and total loss of power
on both engines due to crew inattention to fuel supply. Contributing to
the fuel exhaustion were inadequate flight planning and an engine malfunction of undetermined nature in the right engine which resulted in higherthan-normal fuel consumption. 4. SAFETY RECOMMENDATIONS

No safety recommendations were submitted as a result of this
accident. FAA issued Advisory Circular 91-37A on January 16, 1978, with
detailed guidance relative to leasing of aircraft. BY THE NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] Secondly, the aircraft may not have been fueled with the
amount shown on the fuel slips. The Safety Board considers this explanation
relatively remote because the fuel meters on refueling trucks cannot be
reset and, if functioning properly, will reflect the total amount of
fuel dispensed to a given aircraft. Finally, the engines or an engine could have been burning more
fuel than specified and more than the flightcrew expected to be burned. The witnesses report of torching from the right engine would indicate a
rich fuel mixture or other discrepancy associated with inadequate combustion. Operating an engine in the auto-rich configuration would increase the
fuel consumption by about 25 gallons per hour for that engine, from 183
gal/hr to 208 gal/hr. During the accident flight of 2.8 hours this
would have amounted to about 70 gallons. It is impossible to determine
how long the aircraft was operated with the right engine in auto-rich,
but it was evidently long enough to exhaust the useable fuel on board
the aircraft. Regardless of the high fuel consumption of the right
engine, the 5-hour, or 900+ gallon, fuel supply listed on the flight
pian would have been sufficient to reach the destination. Considering
the increased fuel consumption on the right engine, 583 gallons would
have been required to complete 2.8 hours of flight from Greenville to
the accident site. Therefore, the Safety Board concludes that the right
engine was burning more fuel than anticipated because it was being
operated in the auto-rich fuel mixture. The crew was either negligent or ignorant of the increased
fuel consumption because they failed to monitor adequately the engine
instruments for fuel flow and fuel quantity. Had they properly monitored
their fuel supply and noted excessive fuel consumption early in the
flight, they could have planned an alternate refueling stop rather than
attempting to continue flight with minimum fuel. In addition, the
Safety Board believes that the pilot was not prudent when he continued
the flight with a known engine discrepancy and did not have it corrected
before he left Greenville. This accident involves another operation where the party which
had operational responsibility is in controversy. It appears that it was
the intent of L &amp; J Company to have the operational responsibility assumed
by the lessee, Lynyrd Skynyrd Productions. The lessee, however, appears
to have had no understanding that it was the operator and had assumed
the responsibilities thereby imposed. The question of who was the legal
operator of this flight is currently being litigated by the FAA in an
enforcement action against L &amp; J Company and will be addressed in civil
litigation arising out of this accident. In examining this relationship, the Board reviewed the lease for
this flight.</div>

fueler about the amount of fuel to add at FRG and the flight crew’s failure to ensure an adequate 
fuel supply, the airplane departed FRG with less fuel than the flight crewmembers stated on the 
load manifest and with less fuel than they believed they had. Further, the Safety Board concludes 
that the flight crewmembers failed to adequately monitor the airplane’s fuel state en route and at 
ACY based on the expectation that they had sufficient fuel on board to complete both flights. PROBABLE CAUSE 
 
The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of this 
accident was the flight crew’s failure to ensure an adequate fuel supply for the flight, which led 
to the stoppage of the right engine due to fuel exhaustion and the intermittent stoppage of the left 
engine due to fuel starvation. Contributing to the accident were the flight crew’s failure to 
monitor the airplane’s fuel state and the flight crew’s failure to maintain directional control after 
the initial engine stoppage. Adopted on August 26, 2002</div>

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] Assuming some usable fuel was in the left tank, it is probable that the flight crew’s 
maneuvering after the right engine stoppage may have intermittently unported it, causing the 
sequential stoppage and restarting of the left engine. The Safety Board notes that the loss of the 
right engine occurred while the airplane was in relatively level flight and that the left engine 
stoppage occurred during attempts to maneuver back to the ILS course after the stoppage of the 
right engine. Further, the final loss of control may have been precipitated by momentary stopping 
or starting of the left engine when the airplane was at a reduced airspeed. Impact witness marks 
and airplane damage were consistent with a loss of control at low altitude. Observations made during examination of the accident site and the surrounding area were 
consistent with only a small amount of fuel being on board at the time of the crash. Severe fire 
damage was limited to the area immediately surrounding the crash site, suggesting a lack of 
significant fuel splash from the ruptured tanks. The burn pattern also indicated that there was 
little fuel remaining on board at impact. Fuel starvation to the engines caused by the failure of the LP fuel cock circuitry was also 
considered. However, no determination could be made because the LP fuel cock switches located 
in the cockpit were destroyed by impact and fire. The Safety Board notes that the right engine 
and left engine LP valves, which are controlled by the fuel cock circuitry, were found in the open 
position and that the hydraulic LP valves were found open. Loss of fuel en route was also considered. However, witnesses who observed the 
airplane’s departure from ACY saw no indication of leaking fuel from the wings or the fuel caps. Although the right tank fuel cap was not recovered, metallurgical evidence determined that it had 
been in place before impact. Further, the airplane’s manufacturer indicated that, because of the 
outboard location of the fuel caps, spillage or suction from an open fuel tank filler in level flight 
would be minimal and unlikely. Although the Safety Board’s fuel calculations do not demonstrate that the accident 
airplane was completely out of fuel, the Safety Board considered a critically low fuel state to be 
the most likely scenario given the lack of evidence indicating mechanical failures. Federal

Board notes that during simulator tests, when a left engine failure was induced along with a 
failed right engine on an ILS approach, the airplane remained controllable with minimal 
difficulty. However, the airplane was more difficult to control and required constant flight 
control and trim inputs when the left engine was intermittently failed and restored.33 Because of 
impact damage to the empennage, and the stretching and twisting of the rudder trim control 
cables, an exact rudder trim position for the accident airplane could not be determined. The Safety Board also considered the possibility of a propeller governor malfunction. However, postaccident examinations determined that both propeller governors were functional. Further, had an internal governor failure occurred (such as a seized drive shaft), the loss of oil to 
the propeller dome would have caused the feathering spring to drive the propeller into feather 
and would not have caused significant control problems. Airplane Fuel Loading 
 
Three witness accounts provided information about how much fuel was on board the 
airplane at FRG before fuel was added in preparation for the first flight leg of the day to ACY: 
 
• The captain who cancelled the flight earlier in the day because of weather and because it 
was too late at FRG for the airplane to be refueled stated that the airplane had 
1,200 pounds of fuel on board; 
 
• The Executive Airlines owner and CEO stated that the accident first officer told him 
before departure that the fuel tank measuring sticks indicated that 1,100 pounds of fuel 
were on board; and 
 
• The first officer’s fiancée, who was a passenger to ACY, stated that the first officer 
indicated that 1,200 pounds of fuel were on board and told her that one fuel gauge read 
300 pounds and that the other read 900 pounds. She stated that she believed that the 
300-pound indication was for the right tank. These reports are roughly consistent with Safety Board calculations, based on airplane log pages 
and flight crew records (between May 19 and before the accident airplane’s fueling in FRG), 
which indicated that about 1,000 pounds of fuel were onboard the airplane before the 600 pounds 
(90 gallons) were added on the day of the accident. 
 
 
33 The left engine failure was allowed to operate as if the autolight system occasionally restored the engine briefly 
before failing again. The Safety Board pilots were briefed that the simulated engine failures would occur but did not 
know when.

this test should not be considered conclusive, and that standard test methods should be
relied upon. In addition, the airplane was fueled at Anchorage, as well as at previous
refueling stations in the Reeve system, with Jet A fuel. Therefore, it would have been
impossible to have JP-4 fuel in the fuel controls, Therefore, the Safety Board concludes
that the fuel was Jet A. The Safety Board further concludes that the water in the fuel
was net the result of any improper handling, but rather was the result of dissolved water
coming out of solution in a suspended state due to the unusually low fuel temperatures.

2.3 Loss of No. 2 (Right) Engine Power

The loss of power on the No. 2 (right) engine, indicated by the low torque and
fuel flow, can be associated directly with the reinoval of fuel heat as part of the
before-landing check. The first officer first noticed the loss of torque after he turned off
the fuel heaters. Because of the lengthy exposure of che airplane to very low
temperatures before flight and to extremely low temperatures during cruise, the fuel
temperature would have been well below the freezing point of water. The draining of the
fue) sumps before and after refueling did not reveal any free water in the tanks. However, this visual check, while necessary to insure the absence of free water, cannot
reveal water dissolved in the fuel and must not be relied upon as indicative that fuel icing
will not occur, Analysis of the fuel samples, taken after the accident in less than ideal
conditions, confirmed the presence of water in the fuel system. It is likely that the actual
quantity of water, both free and dissolved, was greater than that implied by the fuel
analysis, Because the samples were taken when the ambient temperatures were still well
below 0° F, anv collected free water in the system would have been frozen and would not
have flowed through the drains when the samples were taken. During flight, the water
would hav&lt; been dispersed in the fuel either as supercooled droplets or small ice crystals
in the fuel, but would not have restricted the fuel flow in the system in that form. And so
long as heat was supplied by the fuel heater, the water would have easily passed through
the engine fuel system as liquid. However, the fuel in the airplane&#x27;s tanks was probably at
very tow temperatures because of the long exposure to low ambient temperatures. Therefore, the fuel heater would have raised the temperature of the fuel entering the
engine only slightly above freezing. Once the fuel heaters were turned off, the water
entrained in the cold fuel would have frozen quickly in the small orifices and screens in
the fuel control and pump, and also could have impregnated the filter element and
partially blocked fuel flow through the filter. Although the first officer, when interviewed, seemed to associate the loss of
torque with the removal of fuel heat, it seems apparent from the CVR transcript that he
did not do so at the time, and, therefore, did not attempt to restore fuel heat. The
captain stated that he sensed the loss of torque at the same time the first officer noticed
the low torque indication.</div>

- Although the Safety Board could not establish the exact cause of the left
4 engine failure, it is apparent that this accident sequence originated with the removal of

that were well below freezing. The instructions in the Nihon operations manual and the
Reeve training manual are not sufficiently detailed to provide adequate guidance for the
crew to make a proper decision on the need for continuing the use of fuel heat. As this
accident revealed, the requirement in the manual for using fuel heat for 2 minutes within
5 rninutes of landing is not adequate to prevent engine fuel system icing when operating in
extreme conditions. The Safety Bourd believes that if the manuals and crew training hed

A fuel were serviced into each of the aircraft&#x27;s two fuel tanks. The
introduction of the jet fuel resulted in a fuel mixture that was not
compatible with the engines installed. The introduction of the jet fuel
lowered the octane rating of the fuel resulting in high opera: ing
‘temperatures, severe detonation, and extensive and sustained power loss. While engine operation was adequate to accomplish a successful takeoff with the utilization oi the water injection system, the termination
of water supply to the engine subsequent to takeoff resulted in immediate
manifestation of the detonation and/or preignition conditions. The apparent inability of the flightcrew to recognize immediately the symptoms
of detonation, or to assess the cause for this condition, prompted the
application of carburetor heat which further elevated induction temperatures
and contributed to even more adverse detonation condition. Cylinder head
tenperatures of both engines attained the 300° C. gage limit as a result of the detonation and/or preignition, Again the action taken in
opening the cowl flaps, in an effort to rectify this indication, was responsible for increasing drag which adversely affected the critical
thrust/drag configuration of the aircraft,

There was no clear understanding between the crew and the fuel service
personnel regarding the type of fuel to be delivered. I It is apparent that the linemen had not received sufficient training

CONCLUSIONS Findings

Based on United’s refueling activity for the morning of November 25,
1990, and on the sequence in which pumps were to be activated, motor
pump unit 3 would have been operating during the refueling of aircraft
that were readied for flight between 0730 and 0900 mountain standard

time. The motor on unit 3 gradually became loose during normal operations
because of inadequately installed or maintained bolts, thus increasing
lateral and vertical vibrations that caused overstress conditions on the
bolts to the point of failure. Operation of the motor on unit 3 while it was no longer bolted down
resulted in a lateral shifting of the motor relative to the punp by
about 2.6 inches, which increased vibrations and friction that
eventually fractured the pump case and two pump bolts and destroyed the
coupler gears and the pump sealing surfaces. The destruction of the pump sealing surfaces and a fractured pump case
resulted in a sizeable fuel leak because of the head pressure in the
tanks that had been filled on the morning of the fire.

fither the hot coupler or the motor on unit 3 provided an ignition
source for the leaking fuel. Had tanks 3 and 4 been equipped with fail-safe control valves and
internal fire valves with fusible links, the amount of fuel that fed the
fire would have been significantly reduced, and. consequently, the
duration and intensity of the fire would have been lessened. Had the control building been located in an area separate from the
motor/pump equipment and outside of the containment area, vital records
that would have been helpful to the investigation would not have been
lost, and emergency response personnel could have accessed emergency
shutoff switches and possibly could have remotely closed some of the
contro? valves, thus reducing the amount of fuel that ultimately fed the

fire. Had equipment thai «wonitors excessive temperatures and vibrations with
automatic shutoff capability been installed on motor/pump unit 3, the
equipment could have detected the vibration of the motor and shut down
the unit, and the fire would not have occurred. Ti2 motor/pump equipment was not properly inspected for a substantial
period of time before the fire. Management of AMR Combs failed to give proper priority to the task of
inspecting and maintaining fuel farm pumping equipment. The airport certificate holder’s (city/county of Denver) lack of
procedures or a contingency plan for responding to a fire of this
magnitude prolonged the duration of the emergency. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations in 14 CFR Part 139
fail to specify the responsibility for inspection of fuel farms located
cn airport property, when such fuel installations are operated by Part
12] and Part 135 air carriers.</div>

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] Fuel could have been leaking slowly from pump 3 for a period of time before
the complete destruction of the sealing surfaces, which resulted in fuel
being sprayed from the pump. [n an effort to determine more precisely the
period of time during which the failure occurred and if fuel had been leaking
for some time before the fire, dipstick records on sump tank 5 were reviewed. The records, wh&#x27;ch indicate the amount of fuel in the underground sump tank,
showed that for about 2 weeks before the fire, there was a uniform increase
of between 1.5 and 3 inches of fuel per day in the sump tank. However, fuel
from a pressure relief valve in the Chase supply pipeline also emptied into
this sump tank. Consequently, it could not be determined whether fuel frem
this pressure relief valve or leaks from pump 3 were filling the sump tank. Further, the records indicated that there may have been some errors made in
the dipstick measurements or the recording of the measurements. For example,
the measurement for November 24, 1990, showed a 4-jnch decrease over the
previous day’s reading, even though no fuel was removed from the sump tank. Consequently, the sump tank filling rate provided no insight into the period
of time that fuel may have been leaking from pump 3 and, this, the period of
time that the failure of the motor/pump unit 3 may have been occurring. In summary, although the damage inaicates that the failure of
motor/pump unit 3 occurred over a period of time, probably days and possibly
weeks, the precise time period could not be determined. The post-fire examination of motor/pump units 1 and 5 indicated that the
motor and pumps in these units were also misaligned. However, there were no
broken or missing bolts in either the pumps or motors. Consequently, the
misalignment was determined to have been the restiit of warping of the bed
plate from the intense heat of the fire. Duration aid Intensity of Fire

Fuel leaking under pressure continued to feed the fire, and, as a
result, the fire quickly intensified. The investigation examined the
possible sources of the pressurized fuel leaks.

Computer records from Chase Transpo tation Company indicated tnat the
fuel delivery on November 25, 1990, from its Aurora facility was terminated
at 0925. The termination of pumping from Aurora was the result of a
communicatica disruption, which suggests that the fire at the fuel farm
damaged part of the communication system that controlled the pump at Aurora. Regardless of the reason for the disruption, the termination of the pumping
operation from Aurora indicates that fuel was not being supplied to the fire
by the oump in Aurora. However, when the communication interruption occurred, the pump stopped
and a valve closed at the discharge side of the pump in Aurora, maintaining
the pressure on the pipeline at about 220 psig. The motor-operated supply
valve at the fuel farm that directed fuel to Continental’s tank 7 remained
open because of the communication interruption.</div>

that many factors can affect the power output of the engine. Contamination within the engine 
fuel supply system is one potential factor. Depending on the size and material characteristics of 
the contamination, a malfunction with either the FCU or the pilot valve (a component of the 
 
135 Transportation Safety Board of Canada, Report Number A02P0320. NTSB 
Aircraft Accident Report

stator vane system) could result in a degradation of engine performance similar to that seen in the 
previously discussed discrepancy reports. A review of SAFECOM and SDR reports identified several events in which an FCU was 
replaced as the corrective action for an engine discrepancy, but these reports do not track the 
component history or examination findings. While the reported events confirm that FCUs are 
typically replaced when a GE CT58-140 engine power discrepancy is reported, they do not 
provide any supportive information regarding the cause of the failure or malfunction that led to 
the event. During examination of the FCUs removed from an SH-3H helicopter involved in a 
July 17, 2009, accident,136 NTSB investigators found that the filter in each FCU had trapped 
trace amounts of debris, but not enough to restrict fuel flow and cause the filter to bypass fuel. However, contamination with dimensional characteristics larger than 40 microns was found 
within the left engine’s FCU, indicating that the contamination bypassed the 40-micron FCU 
filter element. A possible explanation for how the contamination got into the FCU is that the 
main filter’s bypass valve was not completely seated (sealed) and allowed an unknown quantity 
of fuel to bypass the filter during engine operation. According to the operator, the SH-3H did not 
have any engine or FCU problems before or during the accident. The fact that contamination 
larger than 40 microns in this FCU did not result in engine problems provides evidence that the 
FCU can reliably function with some contamination. A review of the S-61 airframe and the GE CT58-140 engine fuel control system showed 
that contamination may originate from several sources, such as the engine-driven dynamic 
(centrifugal) filter, the fuel tank, or the environment during the fueling process. The most likely 
source of fiberglass and organic material (soil) that was found in the FCU teardowns is the fuel 
tank. An NTSB material analysis of a sample from an exemplar fiberglass collector can 
determined that the collector can was likely the source of the fiberglass. The organic material 
(soil) was likely introduced into the tanks during the refueling process. Metal particles may 
originate from the dynamic (centrifugal) filter, although no evidence of contamination from this 
source was found in the accident helicopter’s FCU teardowns.</div>

recommendations to the Federal Aviation Administration:
“Issue an .Operations Alert Bulletin to have FAA inspectors
assure
that crew
training
stresses differences in
fuel-quantity measuring instruments and that crews flying
with the new system are made aware of the possibility of
misinterpretation of gage readings.

misting occurs during an impact sequence is often difficult to evaluate. The crasa/fire/rescue response was rapid and adequate; however,
the rate of fire propagation precluded possibility of rescue for the

The Safety Board could not determine the airworthiness of the
aircraft at the time of the accident. The aircraft had landed at Guan
with the No. 2 engine shut down ard the No. 2 propeller feathered. The
maintenance records for the serses of flights that had begun on June 3,
1976, were carried onvoard the aircraft and any discrepancies, ineluc ing
the reason for shutting down the No. 2 engine, could not be determined. However, since the Air Manila mechanics added fluid t&gt; the No. 2 engine/propelier installation through an access panei, the Safety Board
assumed that the No. 2 engine shutdowm was caused by a loss of oil from
the propeller control. This assumption is supported by the fact that
the mechanics cycled the propeller in and out of the feathered position
after fluid had beer added. The Safety board believes that the maintenance records of this
aircraft reveal a pattern that has a bearing on this accident. Beginning
on May 26, 1976, and continuing through the next two flights before the
aircraft departed Manila on the series of flights that culmi:uated in the
crash, each flightcrew hac reported a problem with the No. 3 engine&#x27;s
horsepower output. Although some corrective maintenance was recurded
after each noted discrepancy, the only component change had been the
replacement of the inducer valve on the No. 3 engine. The horsepower
discrepancy continued uncorrected after this component change and on ali
flights before June 4.

The normal procedure for controlling either an improper turbine
inlet temnerature or horsepower output would be to place the temperature
datum control ewitch in either the &quot;NULL&quot; or &quot;OFF&quot; position and control
the fuel metering of the fuel control by throttle movement. Probably
because of the history of this No. 3 engine, this method of thrustoutput control waa being used by the crew on this series of flights. Because the records were destroyed in the crash, the Safety Board could
not determine if there were other problems with the No. 3 engine during
the flights from Manila to Guam and from Guam to Wake on June 3, 1976,
nor the flight from Wake to Guam on June 4, 1976.</div>

uncontrolled fire for fuel tanks located in impact areas did not adequately minimize the hazards to 
the 767-200 and -300 airplanes from an uncontained engine failure. The NTSB concludes that future aircraft certification efforts would benefit from guidance 
on uncontained engine failure debris models and resulting design mitigations that is based on 
lessons learned from recent in-service events. Therefore, the NTSB recommends that the FAA 
revise AC 20-128A, based on an analysis of uncontained engine failure data since the time that the 
AC was issued, to minimize hazards to an airplane and its occupants if an uncontained engine

3. Conclusions 3.1 Findings 
1. The flight crew was properly certificated and qualified in accordance with federal regulations 
and company requirements. A review of the flight crew’s work and sleep schedules and recent 
activities showed no evidence of factors that could have adversely affected the performance of 
either crewmember on the day of the accident. 
2. The airplane was properly certificated, equipped, and maintained in accordance with federal 
regulations. No evidence indicated any structural, engine, or system failures before the 
uncontained engine failure occurred. 
3. The right engine experienced an uncontained high-pressure turbine (HPT) stage 2 disk rupture 
during the takeoff roll. The HPT stage 2 disk initially separated into two fragments. One 
fragment penetrated through the inboard section of the right wing, severed the main engine 
fuel feed line, breached the fuel tank, traveled up and over the fuselage, and landed about 
3,000 ft away.</div>

1.18 New Investigative Techniques

None 2. ANALYSIS

The flightcrew was properly certificated and trained in
accordance with applicable regulations. There was no evidence of preexisting medical problems that might have affected the flightcrew&#x27;s
performance. The aircraft was certificated and equipped according to
applicable regulations. The gross weight and c.g. were within prescribed
limits. The aircraft&#x27;s structure and components were not factors in
this accident. There was no evidence of any malfunction of the aircraft
or its control system. The propulsion system was operating and was
producing power until fuel was exhausted. The right engine had been
malfunctioning for some time and caused the flightcrew to operate that
engine on auto-rich fuel mixture during the accident flight and. during
previous flights in order to obtain an acceptable level of performance
from it. Although examination of the engine and its components did not
identify the exact discrepancy, the Safety Board believes that the
discrepancy was of a general nature, such as an ignition or induction
problem, and was not a major mechanical failure. Components of the
right engine&#x27;s ignition system were so badly damaged by impact that
engine to distributor timing could not be determined. Consequently, the
pre-impact condition of the ignition system could not be determined from
the evidence available. Based on wreckage examination, the Safety Board concludes that
both engines ceased producing power because of fuel exhaustion. Only
one quart of fuel was recovered from both engines. Evidence obtained
from the fuel quantity gages indicates that both fuel tanks were empty
at the time of impact. According to the best estimates, the aircraft should have had
about 207 gallons of fuel on board at the time of the accident. This
figure is based on a normal cruise configuration with both engines
operating with &quot;auto-lean&quot; fuel mixture. In order to determine the reason for the discrepancy between
calculated fuel on board and actual fuel on board, the Safety Board
analyzed the following three explanations:

First, there could have been a fuel leak. However, no evidence
of fuel leakage, such as stains or loose fuel tank caps or lines, was
found in the wreckage. Although this possibility cannot be discounted
completely, because there is a remote possibility that leakage evidence
could have been obliterated at impact, the Safety Board does not believe
it to be the most viable explanation. Secondly, the aircraft may not have been fueled with the
amount shown on the fuel slips. The Safety Board considers this explanation
relatively remote because the fuel meters on refueling trucks cannot be
reset and, if functioning properly, will reflect the total amount of
fuel dispensed to a given aircraft. Finally, the engines or an engine could have been burning more
fuel than specified and more than the flightcrew expected to be burned.</div>

relatively remote because the fuel meters on refueling trucks cannot be
reset and, if functioning properly, will reflect the total amount of
fuel dispensed to a given aircraft. Finally, the engines or an engine could have been burning more
fuel than specified and more than the flightcrew expected to be burned. The witnesses report of torching from the right engine would indicate a
rich fuel mixture or other discrepancy associated with inadequate combustion. Operating an engine in the auto-rich configuration would increase the
fuel consumption by about 25 gallons per hour for that engine, from 183
gal/hr to 208 gal/hr. During the accident flight of 2.8 hours this
would have amounted to about 70 gallons. It is impossible to determine
how long the aircraft was operated with the right engine in auto-rich,
but it was evidently long enough to exhaust the useable fuel on board
the aircraft. Regardless of the high fuel consumption of the right
engine, the 5-hour, or 900+ gallon, fuel supply listed on the flight
pian would have been sufficient to reach the destination. Considering
the increased fuel consumption on the right engine, 583 gallons would
have been required to complete 2.8 hours of flight from Greenville to
the accident site. Therefore, the Safety Board concludes that the right
engine was burning more fuel than anticipated because it was being
operated in the auto-rich fuel mixture. The crew was either negligent or ignorant of the increased
fuel consumption because they failed to monitor adequately the engine
instruments for fuel flow and fuel quantity. Had they properly monitored
their fuel supply and noted excessive fuel consumption early in the
flight, they could have planned an alternate refueling stop rather than
attempting to continue flight with minimum fuel. In addition, the
Safety Board believes that the pilot was not prudent when he continued
the flight with a known engine discrepancy and did not have it corrected
before he left Greenville. This accident involves another operation where the party which
had operational responsibility is in controversy. It appears that it was
the intent of L &amp; J Company to have the operational responsibility assumed
by the lessee, Lynyrd Skynyrd Productions. The lessee, however, appears
to have had no understanding that it was the operator and had assumed
the responsibilities thereby imposed. The question of who was the legal
operator of this flight is currently being litigated by the FAA in an
enforcement action against L &amp; J Company and will be addressed in civil
litigation arising out of this accident. In examining this relationship, the Board reviewed the lease for
this flight.</div>

3. CONCLUSIONS’ 3.1 Findings

l. Both engines of N55VM ceased to produce power because
the aircraft&#x27;s useable fuel supply was exhausted.

2. The crew failed to monitor adequately the fuel flow,
en route fuel consumption, and fuel quantity gages.

3. The crew failed to take appropriate preflight and
maintenance action to assure an adequate fuel supply for
the flight.

4, The crew operated the aircraft for an indeterminate
amount of time before the accident with the right
engine&#x27;s mixture control in the auto-rich position.

-~ 16 -

5. There were no discernible discrepancies between the
amounts of fuel added to the aircraft and the amounts
shown on the fuel receipts from the servicing facilities.

6. There was no evidence of a fuel leak.

7. There was no fire after impact because little
fuel remained in the aircraft&#x27;s fuel system.

8. The survival of many passengers was due to the lack
of severe impact deformation in the center of the
fuselage and the absence of a postcrash fire.

9. The provisions of the lease intended to satisfy the
requirement for a &quot;truth in leasing clause&quot; did not
result in this lessee having an adequate understanding
as to who was the operator of this flight and what that
means. 3.2 Probable Cause

The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the
probable cause of this accident was fuel exhaustion and total loss of power
on both engines due to crew inattention to fuel supply. Contributing to
the fuel exhaustion were inadequate flight planning and an engine malfunction of undetermined nature in the right engine which resulted in higherthan-normal fuel consumption. 4. SAFETY RECOMMENDATIONS

No safety recommendations were submitted as a result of this
accident. FAA issued Advisory Circular 91-37A on January 16, 1978, with
detailed guidance relative to leasing of aircraft. BY THE NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD

days before the accident did not accurately represent the airplane’s fuel load during this period. Carry-over errors in fuel load documents and differences in fuel calculations could result in 
assumptions of more fuel than was actually on board the airplane. For example, the Safety Board 
notes that its fuel calculations were based on the airplane being loaded to its maximum fuel load 
capacity, an amount that flight crews stated was rarely loaded. Using a 2,900-pound top-off fuel 
amount38 instead of the maximum 3,090 pounds (as assumed in the fuel burn calculations) for 
these instances resulted in only 85 pounds of fuel remaining. Assuming that as much as 
66 pounds were unusable, the remaining 19 pounds, or about 3 gallons, would have been enough 
for only about 1 to 4 minutes of flight. Therefore, assuming that these factors account for some or 
all of the fuel that would have remained under the conditions assumed for the high-speed cruise 
setting calculations and given the larger amount of fuel loaded in the left fuel tank, the right 
engine stoppage could be explained by fuel exhaustion.39 However, the Safety Board notes that 
 
36 In a postaccident interview, the owner and CEO of Executive Airlines stated that the airlines’ pilots could 
determine current fuel loads by subtracting fuel burned from the known quantity at departure and that he believed 
that the fuel burned gauges are more reliable than the fuel quantity gauges. 
37 Although Executive’s owner and CEO stated that flight crew used long range cruise settings, the Safety Board 
considered the airline’s director of operations to be more credible based on his direct interaction with line pilots as 
their supervisor and as a Jetstream 31 check captain and instructor. 
38 As previously noted, Executive Airlines flight crews indicated that it was common practice to list 
2,900 pounds on the load manifest because tanks are rarely filled to the top. 
39 Witness testimony indicated that the right tank contained less fuel when the airplane departed FRG. The 
airplane’s fuel crossfeed valve was found in the closed position. However, it was not possible to determine whether 
this valve was open before the accident (as is required by the airplane checklist in the event of an engine failure).

NTSB/AAB-02/05 
both the 275-pound and 85-pound flight time estimates indicate a critically low fuel state, and a 
fuel state well below the reserve required by the IFR flight plan filed by the flight crew. Further, the apparent difficulties with the left engine could be explained by unporting of 
whatever fuel remained in the left tank.40 Conditions would have been conducive to unporting if, 
for example, the airplane was in a left bank and in a nose-right sideslip following the loss of the 
right engine, which is consistent with flying straight while attempting to turn to the left, as 
indicated by the pilot statement “we’re trying” when the controller queried if the airplane was in 
a left turn.</div>

trusted and monitored the LED display showing fuel used.36 However, the Safety Board notes that 
this display’s accuracy is dependent on pilot input of the correct fuel quantity at the beginning of 
the flight. Engine Stoppage Scenarios 
 
The accident airplane’s estimated fuel burn was calculated using information provided by 
the airplane manufacturer, including the Jetstream 31 flight manual, and the operator. Fuel burn 
calculations were based on flight times entered into the airplane’s logbook. Based on calculations 
for high-speed cruise power settings37 (which included fuel load and fuel burn time estimates for 
taxi, climb, en route flight, and descent), the accident airplane could have had about 275 pounds 
of fuel on board when it crashed. If the airplane, in fact, had 275 pounds of fuel evenly 
distributed between the tanks at the time of the crash this would not explain the right engine 
stoppage and subsequent crash. However, several factors could affect the accuracy of the 
assumptions that were used in these calculations and, consequently, the reliability/accuracy of the 
275-pound result. Factors that can significantly change the amount of fuel burned on any flight include 
different (higher or lower) flight altitudes or airplane configurations, such as flaps and landing 
gear extended for long periods of time. Fuel burn is also increased during rapid, highperformance climbs, such as required for the execution of a missed approach. It is also possible that fuel load information for the accident airplane documented in the 
days before the accident did not accurately represent the airplane’s fuel load during this period. Carry-over errors in fuel load documents and differences in fuel calculations could result in 
assumptions of more fuel than was actually on board the airplane.</div>

NTSB/AAB-02/05 
Statements from the carrier’s owner and the first officer’s fiancée and information from 
the weight and balance form completed by the accident crew suggest that the flight crew planned 
to add a total of 180 gallons to the airplane. If the flight crew intended to load 180 gallons (about 
1,200 pounds), it was common industry and company practice to ask for 90 gallons on each side. However, based on the evidence, it appears that a lack of clear communication between the pilots 
and the fueler resulted in only 90 gallons (about 600 pounds) of fuel being added, a total amount 
confirmed by the fuel order receipt. Further, it is likely that the flight crew did not confirm the 
amount of fuel loaded before departure because flight crews do not see the fuel receipts after 
fueling and because the pilots were not outside the airplane monitoring the fuel loading. The accident flight crew completed a load manifest that stated that the airplane was 
loaded with 2,400 pounds of fuel when it departed from FRG, and it is probable that the accident 
flight crew planned to depart from FRG with 2,400 pounds. Based on the airplane’s performance, 
2,400 pounds of fuel would have been sufficient fuel to fly the two flights without adding fuel 
during the stop at ACY. This would have allowed a takeoff from ACY that was within normal 
weight and balance limits for the airplane with 17 passengers on board. There was no evidence 
that the flight crew asked for additional fuel to be added during the stop at ACY. However, based on the Safety Board’s calculations, it appears that the accident airplane 
departed FRG with about 1,600 pounds of fuel on board, which is 800 pounds less than listed on 
the load manifest. Therefore, the Safety Board concludes that the accident airplane departed FRG 
with less fuel than the pilots thought they had on board. The accident pilots departed from FRG and ACY, completed two checklists (one for each 
of the flights) that included verification of fuel quantity,34 completed both load manifests for each 
of these flights (which required an entry indicating the amount of fuel on the airplane), and flew 
both flights apparently without being aware of a low fuel state. It is possible that the pilots’ belief 
that they had sufficient fuel on board for the flight to AVP caused them to be less vigilant in their 
monitoring of the airplane’s fuel state and slower to consider a low fuel state as the cause of the 
initial engine failure. Although low fuel quantity annunciator lights for each tank illuminate on 
the forward instrument panel when the fuel quantity decreases below 200 pounds, Safety Board 
investigators determined in simulations that these annunciator lights were easily overlooked, 
even when illuminated. Flight crews are required to constantly monitor their airplane’s fuel 
levels. If a pilot suspects that the fuel gauges are unreliable, fuel indicator sticks can be used to 
compare actual tank fuel levels to fuel gauge indications.</div>

usable fuel capacity for each tank. As previously stated, beginning about 1331, the fuel supplied to the engine was being 
drawn solely from the right wing fuel tank by the right fuel boost pump. With the fuel return 
system operating normally, any excess fuel flow to the engine would have been returned and 
distributed equally to both fuel tanks.106 Thus, the NTSB concludes that the left and right fuel 
tanks were equally receiving fuel through the fuel return lines but that the left-wing-heavy fuel 
imbalance continued to increase during the flight because fuel was only being drawn from the 
right fuel tank. The increasing fuel level in the left tank and the accelerated depletion of the fuel 
from the right tank should have been apparent to the pilot because that information would have 
been presented on the fuel quantity indicator. The right fuel boost pump was providing all of the fuel system pressure to the engine 
because the left-side fuel system was no longer able to maintain the required fuel pressure 
through the operation of the left fuel boost pump. (At that time, the fuel pressure output was less 
than 2 psi, even with the left fuel boost pump on continuously.) The circumstances resulting in 
the low fuel pressure state and the degraded performance of the left-side fuel system (which 
restricted access to the fuel contained within the left wing tank and led to the left-wing-heavy 
fuel imbalance) were not resolved at any time during the flight; a possible cause for these 
conditions is discussed in section 2.2.4. Nevertheless, the NTSB concludes that the fuel system 
continued to provide fuel to the engine throughout the flight, even with the low fuel pressure 
state and the degraded performance of the left-side fuel system.

fuel vented overboard was estimated at 91 pounds. NTSB

seen a 15-bar differential on the fuel quantity indicator about that time; the maximum allowable 
fuel imbalance according to the PC-12 AFM was three bars. Also, CAWS data showed that, 
before the airplane’s course change, the pilot was unsuccessful in his attempts to laterally 
balance the fuel load by changing the status of the fuel pumps. The NTSB concludes that, 
although the pilot should have diverted to land the airplane as soon as practical after his attempt 
to restore fuel balance within the maximum imbalance limitation was unsuccessful, his eventual 
decision to divert to BTM likely resulted from his recognition of the magnitude of the increasing 
left-wing-heavy fuel imbalance situation.</div>

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] During the accident flight, the pilot did 
not begin to divert until about 20 to 31 minutes after his attempt to manually restore fuel balance 
was unsuccessful, and he chose BTM even though several closer airports along the airplane’s 
route of flight were available. The pilot had likely downplayed the seriousness of the initial 
advisories because no adverse outcomes resulted from ignoring the advisories during the flight 
from REI to VCB and during an October 2007 flight, when a low fuel pressure state existed that 
also necessitated the automatic operation of the left and right fuel boost pumps to provide the 
required fuel pressure to the engine (see section 1.16.2). 
Because the pilot did not take action to land the airplane as soon as practical after his 
attempt to manually restore fuel balance was unsuccessful, the fuel imbalance continued to 
worsen beyond the maximum imbalance limitation, increasing the airplane’s left rolling moment 
as the flight progressed. The accident sequence is further discussed in sections 2.2.2 through 
2.2.6. 
2.2.2 First Two Flight Legs 
The accident airplane had been fueled to its 406.8-gallon (2,736-pound) capacity on the 
day before the accident with 222 gallons (1,494 pounds) of Jet A fuel. The fuel truck at REI 
contained fuel that was not premixed with a FSII, but the fuel pump contained provisions for 
injecting a FSII during fueling. However, the pilot did not request that a FSII be added when the 
airplane was fueled. CORRECTED COPY

On the day of the accident, the pilot departed REI for VCB as the sole occupant of the 
flight. According to EIS trend data for the flight, the average outside air temperature was -32º C 
when the airplane was operating at its cruise altitude.93 About 1 hour 30 minutes into the flight, 
while the airplane was descending through an altitude of about 10,000 feet, the left and right fuel 
boost pumps began cycling (generally on for 10 seconds and off for 1 second). According to the 
Pilatus PC-12 AFM, the fuel boost pumps operate automatically if a low fuel pressure state 
exists—which occurs when fuel system pressure drops below 2 psi—and the pump’s switch is 
set to the AUTO position.94 By design, the CAWS annunciates a low fuel pressure caution when 
fuel system pressure drops below 2 psi for more than 0.3 second. However, because the CAWS 
did not log any fuel pressure cautions during the flight, it is likely that at least one of the fuel 
boost pumps was able to provide adequate pressure to the fuel system (at least 3.5 psi) within 0.3 
second of the low fuel pressure condition being sensed. The fuel boost pumps continued cycling for 15 minutes, even though they were designed 
to turn off automatically 10 seconds after the fuel system pressure was restored to 3.5 psi.</div>

A fuel were serviced into each of the aircraft&#x27;s two fuel tanks. The
introduction of the jet fuel resulted in a fuel mixture that was not
compatible with the engines installed. The introduction of the jet fuel
lowered the octane rating of the fuel resulting in high opera: ing
‘temperatures, severe detonation, and extensive and sustained power loss. While engine operation was adequate to accomplish a successful takeoff with the utilization oi the water injection system, the termination
of water supply to the engine subsequent to takeoff resulted in immediate
manifestation of the detonation and/or preignition conditions. The apparent inability of the flightcrew to recognize immediately the symptoms
of detonation, or to assess the cause for this condition, prompted the
application of carburetor heat which further elevated induction temperatures
and contributed to even more adverse detonation condition. Cylinder head
tenperatures of both engines attained the 300° C. gage limit as a result of the detonation and/or preignition, Again the action taken in
opening the cowl flaps, in an effort to rectify this indication, was responsible for increasing drag which adversely affected the critical
thrust/drag configuration of the aircraft,

There was no clear understanding between the crew and the fuel service
personnel regarding the type of fuel to be delivered. I It is apparent that the linemen had not received sufficient training
or experience to recognize the fuel requirements of the aircraft. Both

linemen knew they were servicing the aircraft with jet fuel; therefore,
they evidently did not identify the type aircraft or engines installed, I

The mere fact that they added 57 quarts of reciprocating engine oit should
have alerted them to their error.

&#x27;, The flightcrew members were certificated properly and qualified
for the operation involved.

2. The aircraft was airworthy both mechanically and structurally. Its gross weight and center of gravity were within Limits at time
of departure. .

There was no indication of wechanical failure or malfunction of
the aircraft stcucture or systems,

The aircraft was operated in Instrument Meteorological Conditions
(IMC), while on an IFR clearance. There were no difficulties with navigational aids, communications,
or ground based radar equipment.

‘There was no clear understanding between the crew and fuel service
personnel regarding the type of fuel to be delivered. The aircraft was serviced with 200: gallons of Jet A fuel which
diluted and lowered the octane rating of the fuel on board to
a point that it was not compatible with the engines installed,

The Safety Board determines that the probable cause of this accident
was the loss of effective engine power because of improper fel having
been placed in the tanks by relatively. untrained persomiel. A contributing
factor was that the flightcrew did not detect the error. 3. RECOMMENDATIONS

On the basis of this investigation, the Board has vecommended to the
Administrator, Federal Aviation Administration, that Parts 23, 25, 27 and
29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations and Advisory Circular 20-43a be
amended to provide a more adequate color coding system for aircraft

The National Transportation Safety Board determined that the probable cause
of the accident was the failure of the captain to monitor properly the aircraft’s
fuel state and to properly respond to the low fuel state and the crew-member’s
advisories regarding fuel state. This resulted in fuel exhaustion to all engine‘s. His
inattention resulted from preoccupation with a landing gear malfunction and
preparations for a possible landing emergency. Contributing to the accident was the failure of the other two flight
crewmembers either to fully comprehend the criticality of the fuel state or to
successfully communicate their concern to the captain. I

As a result of this accident, the Safety Board has issued the following
recommendations to the Federal Aviation Administration:
“Issue an .Operations Alert Bulletin to have FAA inspectors
assure
that crew
training
stresses differences in
fuel-quantity measuring instruments and that crews flying
with the new system are made aware of the possibility of
misinterpretation of gage readings.
(Class II--Priority
Action) (A-79-32)”
“Emphasize to engineering personnel who approve aircraft
engineering changes or
issuance of Supplemental Type

flight entered holding at CAMRN, and the second EFC was for 2039 as the
flight entered holding at CAMRN. The flightcrew may have assumed that the
previous EFC’s were valid times for which they would receive clearance to
depart holding and begin the approach to JFK before the fuel state became
more critical. In fact, EFC’s are merely estimates by the controllers based
on a dynamic traffic and weather situation and are issued to provide a time
to commence the approach should the flight lose radio contact. When ATC
issued a third EFC of 2105, the flightcrew apparently finally realized that
they had to commence an approach and therefore requested priority handling. However, the Safety Board concludes that the flightcrew had
already exhausted its reserve fuel to reach its alternate by the time it
asked for priority handling. When asked a second time for its alternate, the
first officer responded, at 2046:24, &quot;It was Boston, but we can’t do it now,
we, we, don’t, we run out of fuel now.&quot; Although the first officer had
radioed at 2046:03, &quot;Yes sir, ah, we’ll be able to nold about five minutes,
that’s all we can do,&quot; the airplane did not have sufficient fuel to fly to
its alternate. Moreover, AVA052’s fuel state at the time it was cleared from
holding at CAMRN to commence its approach to JFK was already critical for its
destination. To help ensure sufficient fuel to complete a safe landing, an
emergency should have been declared in order tu receive expedited handling. The airplane exhausted its fuel supply and crashed 47 minutes after the
flightcrew stated that there was not sufficient fuel to make it to the
alternate. This occurred after the flight was vectored for-an ILS approach
to the destination, missed the first approach, and was unable to complete a
second approach.

56

When the flight engineer entered 17,000 pounds of fuel remaining
upon beginning the descent from FL370, the flightcrew should have estimated
the distance and time remaining to destination, approach, alternate, and the
reserve fuel required, in order to ensure that there was sufficient fuel for
the flight. Included in these calculations should be the fue] quantity that
the captain would want on board as he coimenced the first approach. This
latter fuel figure, commonly referred to as the &quot;minimum approach/landing
fuel quantity,&quot; should be a part of a flightcrew’s calculations as the flight
begins descent for landing. There is no indication that the flightcrew of
AVAQ52 had calculated or established such a figure. Again, if a dispatch
system had been functioning for AVA052, the dispatcher could have assisted in
these calculations and contingencies could have been established jointly by:
the dispatcher and flightcrew. The airline’s only written procedure for minimum fuel operation was
published in its B-707 Operations Manual. The procedure was based upon an
indicated fuel quantity in any main tank of 1,000 pounds or less. The
procedure did not address a minimum fuel quantity for which a flight should
be at the outer marker, inbound to the runway.</div>

2.1 General

The evidence confirmed that this accident occurred when the
airplane’s engines lost power from fuel exhaustion while the flight was
Maneuvering for a second instrument approach to JFK. Significant evidence
was information contained on the CVR and examination of the airplane’s
wreckage. There was an absence of fuel odor at the accident site, and no
fire erupted during the impact. The only fuel found in the airplane was
residual unusable fuel. There was no rotational damage to any of the four
engines from impact forces, indicating that they had ceased operation before
ground impact. In addition, the investigation found no engine or fuel system
component malfunctions, including any that could have caused a premature
exhaustion of fuel or a loss of fuel supply to the engine. The investigation revealed that the flightcrew had received the
appropriate flight and ground training in the B-707 and that they possessed
the appropriate flight and medical certification required by the DAAC of
Colombia. Further, they had sufficient previous experience in conducting
B-707 flights from Colombia to JFK. The investigation revealed that the airplane departed Medellin,
Colombia, with sufficient fuel to fly to its destination. Its scheduled
flight time was .4 hours 40 minutes. However, the airplane crashed 6 hours
and 26 minutes after takeoff. Its flight plan called for a &quot;required&quot; fuel
load of 72,430 pounds of fuel for the flight, which included fuel to JFK,
reserve fuel, fuel to the alternate, and holding fuel, for a total of 6 hours
and 8 minutes of flight. The evidence revealed that an additional amount of fuel was loaded
aboard AVA052 above the required load. That amount was about 6,070 pounds,
bringing the total planned load to about 80,500 pounds for takeoff at
Medellin. The Safety Board believes that the actual fuel aboard the flight
zi takeoff from Medellin was about 80,500 pourds, based on various documents
evailable and the fuel figure notations made by the flight engineer during

&#x27;- flight. Because of differences in the fuel numbers on some of these
ents, this value could be in error either way by about 1,000 pounds;
=heless, AVAO52 had sufficient fuel to complete the scheduled flight, as

-¢ to meet other prescribed IFR fuel requirements. For example, there
“ficient fuel to fly the scheduled route to the destination airport

52

(JFK), execute a missed approach, and fly to the alternate airport (Boston).
However, Boston was forecast to be below IFR alternate minimums when AVA052’s

8.
The captain did not recognize the importance of the cues provided by the first officer,
and he failed to perform expected pilot-in-command duties.
9.
The captain was preoccupied with the weight and balance calculations during critical
portions of the flight and, as a result, he did not monitor the fuel crossfeed operations,
which resulted in a fuel imbalance and unusual airplane handling characteristics.
10. The flight crew did not monitor the fuel quantity gauges or respond properly to the
airplane’s changing handling characteristics, and the captain did not start the in-range
checklist at the appropriate altitude; as a result, the crew missed several opportunities
to identify the ongoing fuel crossfeed operations and determine that the airplane’s fuel
was imbalanced. Conclusions

Aircraft Accident Report
11. Although fuel transfer is prohibited on the Convair 580 airplane, fuel transfer can
occur during fuel crossfeed operations if the fuel tank shutoff valve for the tank not
being used is left open. 
12. All of the fuel from the airplane’s left tank that was not used by the engines
transferred into the right tank because the captain intentionally kept the right fuel tank
shutoff valve open during fuel crossfeed operations, which was not in accordance
with approved fuel crossfeed procedures. 
13. During the airplane’s descent to landing, the fuel in the left fuel tank, which was
providing fuel to both engines, was exhausted because both engine-driven fuel pumps
drew air from the left tank into the fuel system instead of fuel from the right tank,
resulting in a dual-engine flameout.
14. Fuel transfer can occur on the Convair 580 airplane if it is operated with different fuel
boost pump output pressure settings and with the fuel crossfeed valves
unintentionally left open.
15. The accident investigation would have benefited from the retrofit of an independent
cockpit voice recorder power source and a cockpit image recorder. 3.2
Probable Cause
The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of
this accident was fuel starvation resulting from the captain’s decision not to follow
approved fuel crossfeed procedures. Contributing to the accident were the captain&#x27;s
inadequate preflight planning, his subsequent distraction during the flight, and his late
initiation of the in-range checklist. Further contributing to the accident was the flight
crew’s failure to monitor the fuel gauges and to recognize that the airplane’s changing
handling characteristics were caused by a fuel imbalance.

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] However, the differences are so diverse between the handling characteristics and
emergency procedures of single-engine and multiengine aircraft, applicants for
multiengine ratings who possess a single-engine instrument rating should be required to
demonstrate their ebility to conduct safe multiengine operat: wns under actual or
simulated instrument conditions, When an inflight emergency occurs, there is little time
to decide the proper action to be taken. A preestablished plan of action and a thorough
knowledge of the aircraft are requisites for the safe and efficient management of unusual,
unexpected deviations from normal flight conditions, especially when the p.lot is burdened
by the extra tasks associated with flight by instrument reference. The pilot had previously flown about 11 cross-country flights in NICOUV. His
longest flight was 1 8/10 hours. The average time for each cross-country flight was about
1 1/2 hours, It is possible that the pilot may have flown elther all or most of these flights
using only the main fuel tanks. Just as likely, however, is the possibility

that he may have been accustomed to switching to reserve fuel further along in the flight,
rather than shortly after leveling off. Since the amount of fuel onboard at takeoff, the
fuel tank selection, the fuel distribution within the tanks, and the pilot&#x27;s preferred
procedures for takeoff, climb, and cruise are matters of conjecture, no significant
conclusions could be drawn from the available fuel information. Additional evidence Indicates that the aircraft&#x27;s engine(s) may have stopped
because of fuel starvation. Witnesses reported hearing the aircraft making &quot;popping&quot;
noises, The engine manufacturer indicated that an interruption of fuel flow to a
Lycoming 10-720 engine could result in a popping noise or backfiring. At the first indication of abnormal engine operation, the pilot should have
advanced the mixture, prop, and throttle controls to the full rich/high RPM/high manifold
position. Having done so, he may have recognized his fuel inanagement error and
attempted to correct it by turning the fuel boost pumps on and selecting auxiliary fuel. Thv surge or increase in engine power as described by witnesses may have been due to the
resumption of fuel flow to the engines as a result of the pilot&#x27;s selection of auxiliary fuel. The fuel tank selectors and boost pumps were located on the fuel control
panel, which was located approximately 90° to the left and below the pilot&#x27;s view of the
primary flight instruments. Switching tanks would therefore have required the pilot to
move his head down and to the left, thus diverting his attention from flying the aircraft. If, while under actual instrument conditions, the pilot&#x27;s eyes were diverted
from the flight instruments and his head was moved downward and turned (as when
changing frequencies, checking flight log data, or changing fuel selectors), the aircraft
rolled or turned at the same time and he suddenly returned his head to the normal
position, a disorientation would most likely have occurred, A false sensation of diving or
rolling beyond the vertical plane would have been produced. AS a result, there may have
heen a strong, instinctive tencency to pitch or roll the aircraft in the opposite direction.</div>

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] Assuming some usable fuel was in the left tank, it is probable that the flight crew’s 
maneuvering after the right engine stoppage may have intermittently unported it, causing the 
sequential stoppage and restarting of the left engine. The Safety Board notes that the loss of the 
right engine occurred while the airplane was in relatively level flight and that the left engine 
stoppage occurred during attempts to maneuver back to the ILS course after the stoppage of the 
right engine. Further, the final loss of control may have been precipitated by momentary stopping 
or starting of the left engine when the airplane was at a reduced airspeed. Impact witness marks 
and airplane damage were consistent with a loss of control at low altitude. Observations made during examination of the accident site and the surrounding area were 
consistent with only a small amount of fuel being on board at the time of the crash. Severe fire 
damage was limited to the area immediately surrounding the crash site, suggesting a lack of 
significant fuel splash from the ruptured tanks. The burn pattern also indicated that there was 
little fuel remaining on board at impact. Fuel starvation to the engines caused by the failure of the LP fuel cock circuitry was also 
considered. However, no determination could be made because the LP fuel cock switches located 
in the cockpit were destroyed by impact and fire. The Safety Board notes that the right engine 
and left engine LP valves, which are controlled by the fuel cock circuitry, were found in the open 
position and that the hydraulic LP valves were found open. Loss of fuel en route was also considered. However, witnesses who observed the 
airplane’s departure from ACY saw no indication of leaking fuel from the wings or the fuel caps. Although the right tank fuel cap was not recovered, metallurgical evidence determined that it had 
been in place before impact. Further, the airplane’s manufacturer indicated that, because of the 
outboard location of the fuel caps, spillage or suction from an open fuel tank filler in level flight 
would be minimal and unlikely. Although the Safety Board’s fuel calculations do not demonstrate that the accident 
airplane was completely out of fuel, the Safety Board considered a critically low fuel state to be 
the most likely scenario given the lack of evidence indicating mechanical failures. Federal 
regulations and company policy state that it is the pilot-in-command’s responsibility to ensure 
before departure that the airplane has the correct amount of fuel onboard for the planned flight.</div>

fueler about the amount of fuel to add at FRG and the flight crew’s failure to ensure an adequate 
fuel supply, the airplane departed FRG with less fuel than the flight crewmembers stated on the 
load manifest and with less fuel than they believed they had. Further, the Safety Board concludes 
that the flight crewmembers failed to adequately monitor the airplane’s fuel state en route and at 
ACY based on the expectation that they had sufficient fuel on board to complete both flights. PROBABLE CAUSE 
 
The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of this 
accident was the flight crew’s failure to ensure an adequate fuel supply for the flight, which led 
to the stoppage of the right engine due to fuel exhaustion and the intermittent stoppage of the left 
engine due to fuel starvation. Contributing to the accident were the flight crew’s failure to 
monitor the airplane’s fuel state and the flight crew’s failure to maintain directional control after 
the initial engine stoppage. Adopted on August 26, 2002</div>

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] Fuel burn is also increased during rapid, highperformance climbs, such as required for the execution of a missed approach. It is also possible that fuel load information for the accident airplane documented in the 
days before the accident did not accurately represent the airplane’s fuel load during this period. Carry-over errors in fuel load documents and differences in fuel calculations could result in 
assumptions of more fuel than was actually on board the airplane. For example, the Safety Board 
notes that its fuel calculations were based on the airplane being loaded to its maximum fuel load 
capacity, an amount that flight crews stated was rarely loaded. Using a 2,900-pound top-off fuel 
amount38 instead of the maximum 3,090 pounds (as assumed in the fuel burn calculations) for 
these instances resulted in only 85 pounds of fuel remaining. Assuming that as much as 
66 pounds were unusable, the remaining 19 pounds, or about 3 gallons, would have been enough 
for only about 1 to 4 minutes of flight. Therefore, assuming that these factors account for some or 
all of the fuel that would have remained under the conditions assumed for the high-speed cruise 
setting calculations and given the larger amount of fuel loaded in the left fuel tank, the right 
engine stoppage could be explained by fuel exhaustion.39 However, the Safety Board notes that 
 
36 In a postaccident interview, the owner and CEO of Executive Airlines stated that the airlines’ pilots could 
determine current fuel loads by subtracting fuel burned from the known quantity at departure and that he believed 
that the fuel burned gauges are more reliable than the fuel quantity gauges. 
37 Although Executive’s owner and CEO stated that flight crew used long range cruise settings, the Safety Board 
considered the airline’s director of operations to be more credible based on his direct interaction with line pilots as 
their supervisor and as a Jetstream 31 check captain and instructor. 
38 As previously noted, Executive Airlines flight crews indicated that it was common practice to list 
2,900 pounds on the load manifest because tanks are rarely filled to the top. 
39 Witness testimony indicated that the right tank contained less fuel when the airplane departed FRG. The 
airplane’s fuel crossfeed valve was found in the closed position. However, it was not possible to determine whether 
this valve was open before the accident (as is required by the airplane checklist in the event of an engine failure).

33 
NTSB/AAB-02/05 
both the 275-pound and 85-pound flight time estimates indicate a critically low fuel state, and a 
fuel state well below the reserve required by the IFR flight plan filed by the flight crew. Further, the apparent difficulties with the left engine could be explained by unporting of

for example, the airplane was in a left bank and in a nose-right sideslip following the loss of the 
right engine, which is consistent with flying straight while attempting to turn to the left, as 
indicated by the pilot statement “we’re trying” when the controller queried if the airplane was in 
a left turn.</div>

8.
The captain did not recognize the importance of the cues provided by the first officer,
and he failed to perform expected pilot-in-command duties.
9.
The captain was preoccupied with the weight and balance calculations during critical
portions of the flight and, as a result, he did not monitor the fuel crossfeed operations,
which resulted in a fuel imbalance and unusual airplane handling characteristics.
10. The flight crew did not monitor the fuel quantity gauges or respond properly to the
airplane’s changing handling characteristics, and the captain did not start the in-range
checklist at the appropriate altitude; as a result, the crew missed several opportunities
to identify the ongoing fuel crossfeed operations and determine that the airplane’s fuel
was imbalanced. Conclusions

Aircraft Accident Report
11. Although fuel transfer is prohibited on the Convair 580 airplane, fuel transfer can
occur during fuel crossfeed operations if the fuel tank shutoff valve for the tank not
being used is left open. 
12. All of the fuel from the airplane’s left tank that was not used by the engines
transferred into the right tank because the captain intentionally kept the right fuel tank
shutoff valve open during fuel crossfeed operations, which was not in accordance
with approved fuel crossfeed procedures. 
13. During the airplane’s descent to landing, the fuel in the left fuel tank, which was
providing fuel to both engines, was exhausted because both engine-driven fuel pumps
drew air from the left tank into the fuel system instead of fuel from the right tank,
resulting in a dual-engine flameout.
14. Fuel transfer can occur on the Convair 580 airplane if it is operated with different fuel
boost pump output pressure settings and with the fuel crossfeed valves
unintentionally left open.
15. The accident investigation would have benefited from the retrofit of an independent
cockpit voice recorder power source and a cockpit image recorder. 3.2
Probable Cause
The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of
this accident was fuel starvation resulting from the captain’s decision not to follow
approved fuel crossfeed procedures. Contributing to the accident were the captain&#x27;s
inadequate preflight planning, his subsequent distraction during the flight, and his late
initiation of the in-range checklist. Further contributing to the accident was the flight
crew’s failure to monitor the fuel gauges and to recognize that the airplane’s changing
handling characteristics were caused by a fuel imbalance.

Aircraft Accident Report
concludes that all of the fuel from the airplane’s left tank that was not used by the engines
transferred into the right tank because the captain intentionally kept the right fuel tank
shutoff valve open during fuel crossfeed operations, which was not in accordance with
approved fuel crossfeed procedures. Therefore, to prevent similar accidents from
occurring in the future, the Safety Board believes that the FAA should issue a flight
standards information bulletin to all principal operations inspectors of Convair 580
operators that familiarizes operators with the circumstances of the Air Tahoma flight 185
accident, including the importance of closing the fuel tank shutoff valve for the tank not
being used during fuel crossfeed operations.
2.5
Dual Engine Power Loss
The Safety Board considered why both engines lost power even though the right
fuel tank had sufficient fuel for operation. Further, after the engines failed, the flight crew
was still able to make transmissions to ATC, the GPWS alerted, and the FDR continued to
record, indicating that the airplane still had partial electrical power. Wreckage examinations indicated that, when the left fuel tank was exhausted of
fuel, the left fuel boost pump most likely continued to operate, which allowed air to enter
the fuel system and reduced the fuel pressure to the left and right engine-driven fuel pump
inlets. If the captain had turned on the right fuel boost pump after he identified that he had
left the crossfeed valve switch open, it is possible that the right engine would have
received sufficient fuel pressure to continue to operate; however, there is no evidence that
he did so. Specifically, the right fuel boost pump fan motor cooling fan cover and the
blade directly beneath the cover were found bent inward, and no rotational markings were
found, indicating that the right fuel boost pump was not operating at the time of impact. Postaccident testing of the left and right fuel pumps revealed no evidence of preexisting
failures.</div>

usable fuel capacity for each tank. As previously stated, beginning about 1331, the fuel supplied to the engine was being 
drawn solely from the right wing fuel tank by the right fuel boost pump. With the fuel return 
system operating normally, any excess fuel flow to the engine would have been returned and 
distributed equally to both fuel tanks.106 Thus, the NTSB concludes that the left and right fuel 
tanks were equally receiving fuel through the fuel return lines but that the left-wing-heavy fuel 
imbalance continued to increase during the flight because fuel was only being drawn from the 
right fuel tank. The increasing fuel level in the left tank and the accelerated depletion of the fuel 
from the right tank should have been apparent to the pilot because that information would have 
been presented on the fuel quantity indicator. The right fuel boost pump was providing all of the fuel system pressure to the engine 
because the left-side fuel system was no longer able to maintain the required fuel pressure 
through the operation of the left fuel boost pump. (At that time, the fuel pressure output was less 
than 2 psi, even with the left fuel boost pump on continuously.) The circumstances resulting in 
the low fuel pressure state and the degraded performance of the left-side fuel system (which 
restricted access to the fuel contained within the left wing tank and led to the left-wing-heavy 
fuel imbalance) were not resolved at any time during the flight; a possible cause for these 
conditions is discussed in section 2.2.4. Nevertheless, the NTSB concludes that the fuel system 
continued to provide fuel to the engine throughout the flight, even with the low fuel pressure 
state and the degraded performance of the left-side fuel system. 
2.2.3.2 Descent Into the Terminal Area and Impact

106 About 1417, the left tank had reached its 1,368-pound total capacity (1,352 pounds of which was usable 
fuel), so any excess fuel from that point in the flight onward would have been vented overboard. The total amount of 
fuel vented overboard was estimated at 91 pounds. NTSB

seen a 15-bar differential on the fuel quantity indicator about that time; the maximum allowable 
fuel imbalance according to the PC-12 AFM was three bars. Also, CAWS data showed that, 
before the airplane’s course change, the pilot was unsuccessful in his attempts to laterally 
balance the fuel load by changing the status of the fuel pumps. The NTSB concludes that, 
although the pilot should have diverted to land the airplane as soon as practical after his attempt 
to restore fuel balance within the maximum imbalance limitation was unsuccessful, his eventual 
decision to divert to BTM likely resulted from his recognition of the magnitude of the increasing 
left-wing-heavy fuel imbalance situation.</div>

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] The fuel boost pumps continued cycling for 15 minutes, even though they were designed 
to turn off automatically 10 seconds after the fuel system pressure was restored to 3.5 psi. Thus, 
it is likely that the fuel pressure dropped below 2 psi each time the boost pumps turned off, so the 
pumps continued cycling to return pressure to 3.5 psi within 0.3 second. After both fuel boost pumps had cycled for 15 minutes, the left fuel boost pump was on 
continuously, and the right fuel boost pump was off. This change in status occurred because, as 
the fuel boost pumps operated to correct the low fuel pressure situation, a left-wing-heavy fuel 
imbalance of about 70 pounds was created. According to Pilatus, when a fuel imbalance of about 
70 pounds (5 percent of each wing’s total fuel capacity) occurs, the fuel boost pump in the tank 
with the higher fuel quantity operates automatically, and the fuel boost pump continues to 
operate until the fuel levels in both tanks are equalized. Pilatus also stated that a single fuel boost 
pump operating continuously could simultaneously correct a fuel imbalance and a low fuel 
pressure state. A fuel imbalance of about 70 pounds is displayed on the EIS fuel quantity 
indicator (see figure 4) by a two-bar differential between the fuel tanks. The left fuel boost pump was on continuously until the end of the flight, which occurred 
about 6 minutes later. The left fuel boost pump was able to maintain the required fuel system 
pressure during this time without the operation of the right fuel boost pump. Because the left fuel 
boost pump had not turned off before the end of the flight, it is likely that the fuel balancing 
system was still automatically rebalancing the fuel load at that time. When the airplane arrived at VCB, the pilot refueled the airplane at the airport’s 
self-service fueling island with about 128 gallons (861 pounds) of Jet A fuel.95 At this point, the 
fuel tanks would most likely have been refilled to their maximum capacity (1,368 pounds each). 
The fuel dispensed at the VCB self-service fueling island was not premixed with a FSII, and the 
 
93 EIS trend data recorded between 0823:53 and 0905:05 PDT showed that, when the airplane was operating at 
FL220, the total air temperature was -24º C. The average outside air temperature, which is corrected for airspeed, 
was -32º C. 
94 As stated in section 1.6.1, each fuel boost pump is controlled by a two-position (AUTO or ON) switch. The 
AUTO position is the normal setting, and the fuel boost pumps operate automatically when a pressure switch within 
the fuel system’s air separator detects fuel pressure below 2 psi.</div>

not begin to divert until about 20 to 31 minutes after his attempt to manually restore fuel balance 
was unsuccessful, and he chose BTM even though several closer airports along the airplane’s 
route of flight were available. The pilot had likely downplayed the seriousness of the initial 
advisories because no adverse outcomes resulted from ignoring the advisories during the flight 
from REI to VCB and during an October 2007 flight, when a low fuel pressure state existed that 
also necessitated the automatic operation of the left and right fuel boost pumps to provide the 
required fuel pressure to the engine (see section 1.16.2). 
Because the pilot did not take action to land the airplane as soon as practical after his 
attempt to manually restore fuel balance was unsuccessful, the fuel imbalance continued to 
worsen beyond the maximum imbalance limitation, increasing the airplane’s left rolling moment 
as the flight progressed. The accident sequence is further discussed in sections 2.2.2 through 
2.2.6. 
2.2.2 First Two Flight Legs 
The accident airplane had been fueled to its 406.8-gallon (2,736-pound) capacity on the 
day before the accident with 222 gallons (1,494 pounds) of Jet A fuel. The fuel truck at REI 
contained fuel that was not premixed with a FSII, but the fuel pump contained provisions for 
injecting a FSII during fueling. However, the pilot did not request that a FSII be added when the 
airplane was fueled. CORRECTED COPY

On the day of the accident, the pilot departed REI for VCB as the sole occupant of the 
flight. According to EIS trend data for the flight, the average outside air temperature was -32º C 
when the airplane was operating at its cruise altitude.93 About 1 hour 30 minutes into the flight, 
while the airplane was descending through an altitude of about 10,000 feet, the left and right fuel 
boost pumps began cycling (generally on for 10 seconds and off for 1 second). According to the 
Pilatus PC-12 AFM, the fuel boost pumps operate automatically if a low fuel pressure state 
exists—which occurs when fuel system pressure drops below 2 psi—and the pump’s switch is 
set to the AUTO position.94 By design, the CAWS annunciates a low fuel pressure caution when 
fuel system pressure drops below 2 psi for more than 0.3 second. However, because the CAWS 
did not log any fuel pressure cautions during the flight, it is likely that at least one of the fuel 
boost pumps was able to provide adequate pressure to the fuel system (at least 3.5 psi) within 0.3 
second of the low fuel pressure condition being sensed. The fuel boost pumps continued cycling for 15 minutes, even though they were designed 
to turn off automatically 10 seconds after the fuel system pressure was restored to 3.5 psi.</div>

this test should not be considered conclusive, and that standard test methods should be
relied upon. In addition, the airplane was fueled at Anchorage, as well as at previous
refueling stations in the Reeve system, with Jet A fuel. Therefore, it would have been
impossible to have JP-4 fuel in the fuel controls, Therefore, the Safety Board concludes
that the fuel was Jet A. The Safety Board further concludes that the water in the fuel
was net the result of any improper handling, but rather was the result of dissolved water
coming out of solution in a suspended state due to the unusually low fuel temperatures.

2.3 Loss of No. 2 (Right) Engine Power

The loss of power on the No. 2 (right) engine, indicated by the low torque and
fuel flow, can be associated directly with the reinoval of fuel heat as part of the
before-landing check. The first officer first noticed the loss of torque after he turned off
the fuel heaters. Because of the lengthy exposure of che airplane to very low
temperatures before flight and to extremely low temperatures during cruise, the fuel
temperature would have been well below the freezing point of water. The draining of the
fue) sumps before and after refueling did not reveal any free water in the tanks. However, this visual check, while necessary to insure the absence of free water, cannot
reveal water dissolved in the fuel and must not be relied upon as indicative that fuel icing
will not occur, Analysis of the fuel samples, taken after the accident in less than ideal
conditions, confirmed the presence of water in the fuel system. It is likely that the actual
quantity of water, both free and dissolved, was greater than that implied by the fuel
analysis, Because the samples were taken when the ambient temperatures were still well
below 0° F, anv collected free water in the system would have been frozen and would not
have flowed through the drains when the samples were taken. During flight, the water
would hav&lt; been dispersed in the fuel either as supercooled droplets or small ice crystals
in the fuel, but would not have restricted the fuel flow in the system in that form. And so
long as heat was supplied by the fuel heater, the water would have easily passed through
the engine fuel system as liquid. However, the fuel in the airplane&#x27;s tanks was probably at
very tow temperatures because of the long exposure to low ambient temperatures. Therefore, the fuel heater would have raised the temperature of the fuel entering the
engine only slightly above freezing. Once the fuel heaters were turned off, the water
entrained in the cold fuel would have frozen quickly in the small orifices and screens in
the fuel control and pump, and also could have impregnated the filter element and
partially blocked fuel flow through the filter. Although the first officer, when interviewed, seemed to associate the loss of
torque with the removal of fuel heat, it seems apparent from the CVR transcript that he
did not do so at the time, and, therefore, did not attempt to restore fuel heat. The
captain stated that he sensed the loss of torque at the same time the first officer noticed
the low torque indication.</div>

airplane until assisted by the captain who opened the exit. Subsequent investigation
revealed that the catch wes difficult to locate. The Safety Board believes that under

the complete destruction of the sealing surfaces, which resulted in fuel
being sprayed from the pump. [n an effort to determine more precisely the
period of time during which the failure occurred and if fuel had been leaking
for some time before the fire, dipstick records on sump tank 5 were reviewed. The records, wh&#x27;ch indicate the amount of fuel in the underground sump tank,
showed that for about 2 weeks before the fire, there was a uniform increase
of between 1.5 and 3 inches of fuel per day in the sump tank. However, fuel
from a pressure relief valve in the Chase supply pipeline also emptied into
this sump tank. Consequently, it could not be determined whether fuel frem
this pressure relief valve or leaks from pump 3 were filling the sump tank. Further, the records indicated that there may have been some errors made in
the dipstick measurements or the recording of the measurements. For example,
the measurement for November 24, 1990, showed a 4-jnch decrease over the
previous day’s reading, even though no fuel was removed from the sump tank. Consequently, the sump tank filling rate provided no insight into the period
of time that fuel may have been leaking from pump 3 and, this, the period of
time that the failure of the motor/pump unit 3 may have been occurring. In summary, although the damage inaicates that the failure of
motor/pump unit 3 occurred over a period of time, probably days and possibly
weeks, the precise time period could not be determined. The post-fire examination of motor/pump units 1 and 5 indicated that the
motor and pumps in these units were also misaligned. However, there were no
broken or missing bolts in either the pumps or motors. Consequently, the
misalignment was determined to have been the restiit of warping of the bed
plate from the intense heat of the fire. Duration aid Intensity of Fire

Fuel leaking under pressure continued to feed the fire, and, as a
result, the fire quickly intensified. The investigation examined the
possible sources of the pressurized fuel leaks.

Computer records from Chase Transpo tation Company indicated tnat the
fuel delivery on November 25, 1990, from its Aurora facility was terminated
at 0925. The termination of pumping from Aurora was the result of a
communicatica disruption, which suggests that the fire at the fuel farm
damaged part of the communication system that controlled the pump at Aurora. Regardless of the reason for the disruption, the termination of the pumping
operation from Aurora indicates that fuel was not being supplied to the fire
by the oump in Aurora. However, when the communication interruption occurred, the pump stopped
and a valve closed at the discharge side of the pump in Aurora, maintaining
the pressure on the pipeline at about 220 psig. The motor-operated supply
valve at the fuel farm that directed fuel to Continental’s tank 7 remained
open because of the communication interruption.</div>

CONCLUSIONS Findings

Based on United’s refueling activity for the morning of November 25,
1990, and on the sequence in which pumps were to be activated, motor
pump unit 3 would have been operating during the refueling of aircraft
that were readied for flight between 0730 and 0900 mountain standard

time. The motor on unit 3 gradually became loose during normal operations
because of inadequately installed or maintained bolts, thus increasing
lateral and vertical vibrations that caused overstress conditions on the
bolts to the point of failure. Operation of the motor on unit 3 while it was no longer bolted down
resulted in a lateral shifting of the motor relative to the punp by
about 2.6 inches, which increased vibrations and friction that
eventually fractured the pump case and two pump bolts and destroyed the
coupler gears and the pump sealing surfaces. The destruction of the pump sealing surfaces and a fractured pump case
resulted in a sizeable fuel leak because of the head pressure in the
tanks that had been filled on the morning of the fire.

fither the hot coupler or the motor on unit 3 provided an ignition
source for the leaking fuel. Had tanks 3 and 4 been equipped with fail-safe control valves and
internal fire valves with fusible links, the amount of fuel that fed the
fire would have been significantly reduced, and. consequently, the
duration and intensity of the fire would have been lessened. Had the control building been located in an area separate from the
motor/pump equipment and outside of the containment area, vital records
that would have been helpful to the investigation would not have been
lost, and emergency response personnel could have accessed emergency
shutoff switches and possibly could have remotely closed some of the
contro? valves, thus reducing the amount of fuel that ultimately fed the

fire. Had equipment thai «wonitors excessive temperatures and vibrations with
automatic shutoff capability been installed on motor/pump unit 3, the
equipment could have detected the vibration of the motor and shut down
the unit, and the fire would not have occurred. Ti2 motor/pump equipment was not properly inspected for a substantial
period of time before the fire. Management of AMR Combs failed to give proper priority to the task of
inspecting and maintaining fuel farm pumping equipment. The airport certificate holder’s (city/county of Denver) lack of
procedures or a contingency plan for responding to a fire of this
magnitude prolonged the duration of the emergency. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations in 14 CFR Part 139
fail to specify the responsibility for inspection of fuel farms located
cn airport property, when such fuel installations are operated by Part
12] and Part 135 air carriers.</div>

emergency procedures of single-engine and multiengine aircraft, applicants for
multiengine ratings who possess a single-engine instrument rating should be required to
demonstrate their ebility to conduct safe multiengine operat: wns under actual or
simulated instrument conditions, When an inflight emergency occurs, there is little time
to decide the proper action to be taken. A preestablished plan of action and a thorough
knowledge of the aircraft are requisites for the safe and efficient management of unusual,
unexpected deviations from normal flight conditions, especially when the p.lot is burdened
by the extra tasks associated with flight by instrument reference. The pilot had previously flown about 11 cross-country flights in NICOUV. His
longest flight was 1 8/10 hours. The average time for each cross-country flight was about
1 1/2 hours, It is possible that the pilot may have flown elther all or most of these flights
using only the main fuel tanks. Just as likely, however, is the possibility

that he may have been accustomed to switching to reserve fuel further along in the flight,
rather than shortly after leveling off. Since the amount of fuel onboard at takeoff, the
fuel tank selection, the fuel distribution within the tanks, and the pilot&#x27;s preferred
procedures for takeoff, climb, and cruise are matters of conjecture, no significant
conclusions could be drawn from the available fuel information. Additional evidence Indicates that the aircraft&#x27;s engine(s) may have stopped
because of fuel starvation. Witnesses reported hearing the aircraft making &quot;popping&quot;
noises, The engine manufacturer indicated that an interruption of fuel flow to a
Lycoming 10-720 engine could result in a popping noise or backfiring. At the first indication of abnormal engine operation, the pilot should have
advanced the mixture, prop, and throttle controls to the full rich/high RPM/high manifold
position. Having done so, he may have recognized his fuel inanagement error and
attempted to correct it by turning the fuel boost pumps on and selecting auxiliary fuel. Thv surge or increase in engine power as described by witnesses may have been due to the
resumption of fuel flow to the engines as a result of the pilot&#x27;s selection of auxiliary fuel. The fuel tank selectors and boost pumps were located on the fuel control
panel, which was located approximately 90° to the left and below the pilot&#x27;s view of the
primary flight instruments. Switching tanks would therefore have required the pilot to
move his head down and to the left, thus diverting his attention from flying the aircraft. If, while under actual instrument conditions, the pilot&#x27;s eyes were diverted
from the flight instruments and his head was moved downward and turned (as when
changing frequencies, checking flight log data, or changing fuel selectors), the aircraft
rolled or turned at the same time and he suddenly returned his head to the normal
position, a disorientation would most likely have occurred, A false sensation of diving or
rolling beyond the vertical plane would have been produced. AS a result, there may have
heen a strong, instinctive tencency to pitch or roll the aircraft in the opposite direction.</div>

fuel was in the ¢ans at impact. Therefore, since the fuel had not been
added while the aircraft was on the water at Twin Lakes and since only
one lauding is usually made on a flight of this nature, it is probable
that the pilot considered the fuel remaining iu his main tanks to be
sufficient for the return trip to Anchorage. In view of the above evidence and “he owner&#x27;s initial statements
that the aircraft had 6 nours of fuel on board, and s.nce the pilot knew
of the variations a sightseeing tour might take, the Safety Buard believes
that the aircraft was carrying more fuel than was assumed by the owner
in his postaccident computations. The telephone conversations between the National Park Service
personnel and Ketchum Air Service, Inc., regarding passenger weights
indicated conerrn regarding the weight and balance of the aircraft. However, there is no evidence hat the weight and balance was actually computed nor that less than a full load of fuel was carried on the flight. Although remote, the possibility exists that the pilot did not
use the rear fuel as soon as possible after all wing fuel had been used. If he did not, the c.g. would move farther aft and would cause the
control situation to worsen as fuel was burned off. With a c.g. near the aft limits, static stability decreases, the
stick forces are lighter, and stall recovery is more difficult.

~ ee

The aircraft&#x27;s 75° descent angle and 40° nosedown attitude
at the time of impact indicates that it was not under control or that
control had not been regained effectively before it crashed. Since the aircraft and powerplant were found to have been
operational before impact, the only remaining situation which could
have caused the loss of control of the aircraft would be passenger
movements or interference and airspeed bleedoff from an incorrect
flight control input while the pilot was being distracted from his primary duties. Passenger movement can be discounted since the passengers
were seated so closely together and any movement would have been
difficult after the aircraft became ai rborne. In addition, had the
passengers been moving when the aircraft became uncontrolled, they
would not have had time to reseat themselves and fasten their seatbelts. Rescuers found all the occupants in their seats with their seatbelts fastened,

The remaining possible cause of the loss of control is an

inadvertent entry into a stall as a result of the pilot&#x27;s failure to
monitor adequately his flight condition while being preoccupied with
other activities, If the pilot became engrossed in showing his pasSengers the scenery while flying a few hundred feet above the terrain,
he may have neglected to monitor the attitude of the aircraft relative
to its airspeed. After considering all of the evidence available, the Safety
Board concludes that the pilot failed to adhere to safe operating
procedures by allowing his attention to be diverted to the degree
that his aircraft stalled and he lost control at an altitude too low to
effect recovery. The Safety Board is concerned by the aircraft owner&#x27;s inadequate flight following and his late notizication of the missing aircraft.</div>

running out of fuel. However, the TRACON controller turned the flight back
onto a downwind leg and asked the flight&#x27;if it could accept a base leg
15 miles northeast of JFK. The first officer of AVA052 responded, &quot;I guess
so.&quot;

Shortly thereafter, at 2124:22, the captain again advised the
first officer to, &quot;advise him we have an emergency.&quot; Four seconds later, the
captain said, &quot;did you tell him?&quot; The first officer replied, “yes sir, I
already advised him.&quot; Further, at 2125:08, the captain said to the first
officer, &quot;advise him we don’t have fuel.&quot; He asked again, at 2125:28, &quot;Did
you advise him that we don’t have fuel?&quot; The first officer again said, &quot;yes
sir, I already advise him....&quot;

These intracockpit conversations indicate a total breakdown in
communications by the flightcrew in its attempts to relay the situation to
ATC. The accident may have been inevitable at that point, because the
engines began to flame out only about 7 minutes later. However, it is
obvious that the first officer failed to convey the message that the captain
intended. The evidence strongly suggests that the captain was unaware, at
times, of the content of the first officer’s transmissions and that he did
not hear or understand the ATC communications. The captain may have been
preoccupied with flying the airplane and paying little attention to the first
officer’s ATC radio transmissions. However, the Safety Board believes it
more likely that his limited command of the English language prevented him
from effectively monitoring the content of the transmission. The Safety ©
Board further believes that this deficiency might have been a factor in the
accident, particularly if the captain believed that the first officer had
adequately expressed the criticality of the fuel situation upon departure
from CAMRN. .

In summary, the Safety Board believes that the two key factors
leading to this accident were the flightcrew’s failure to notify ATC of their
fuel situation while holding at CAMRN in order to ensure arrival at the
approach fix with an adequate approach minimum fuel level and a breakdown in
communications between the flightcrew and ATC, and among the flight
crewmembers. As a result of a fatal air carrier accident and an incident in
which fuel exhaustion was determined to be causal, the Safety Board issued
Safety Recommendation A-81-14 to the FAA on February 24, 1981.</div>

flight entered holding at CAMRN, and the second EFC was for 2039 as the
flight entered holding at CAMRN. The flightcrew may have assumed that the
previous EFC’s were valid times for which they would receive clearance to
depart holding and begin the approach to JFK before the fuel state became
more critical. In fact, EFC’s are merely estimates by the controllers based
on a dynamic traffic and weather situation and are issued to provide a time
to commence the approach should the flight lose radio contact. When ATC
issued a third EFC of 2105, the flightcrew apparently finally realized that
they had to commence an approach and therefore requested priority handling. However, the Safety Board concludes that the flightcrew had
already exhausted its reserve fuel to reach its alternate by the time it
asked for priority handling. When asked a second time for its alternate, the
first officer responded, at 2046:24, &quot;It was Boston, but we can’t do it now,
we, we, don’t, we run out of fuel now.&quot; Although the first officer had
radioed at 2046:03, &quot;Yes sir, ah, we’ll be able to nold about five minutes,
that’s all we can do,&quot; the airplane did not have sufficient fuel to fly to
its alternate. Moreover, AVA052’s fuel state at the time it was cleared from
holding at CAMRN to commence its approach to JFK was already critical for its
destination. To help ensure sufficient fuel to complete a safe landing, an
emergency should have been declared in order tu receive expedited handling. The airplane exhausted its fuel supply and crashed 47 minutes after the
flightcrew stated that there was not sufficient fuel to make it to the
alternate. This occurred after the flight was vectored for-an ILS approach
to the destination, missed the first approach, and was unable to complete a
second approach.

56

When the flight engineer entered 17,000 pounds of fuel remaining
upon beginning the descent from FL370, the flightcrew should have estimated
the distance and time remaining to destination, approach, alternate, and the
reserve fuel required, in order to ensure that there was sufficient fuel for
the flight. Included in these calculations should be the fue] quantity that
the captain would want on board as he coimenced the first approach. This
latter fuel figure, commonly referred to as the &quot;minimum approach/landing
fuel quantity,&quot; should be a part of a flightcrew’s calculations as the flight
begins descent for landing. There is no indication that the flightcrew of
AVAQ52 had calculated or established such a figure. Again, if a dispatch
system had been functioning for AVA052, the dispatcher could have assisted in
these calculations and contingencies could have been established jointly by:
the dispatcher and flightcrew. The airline’s only written procedure for minimum fuel operation was
published in its B-707 Operations Manual. The procedure was based upon an
indicated fuel quantity in any main tank of 1,000 pounds or less. The
procedure did not address a minimum fuel quantity for which a flight should
be at the outer marker, inbound to the runway.</div>

The National Transportation Safety Board determined that the probable cause
of the accident was the failure of the captain to monitor properly the aircraft’s
fuel state and to properly respond to the low fuel state and the crew-member’s
advisories regarding fuel state. This resulted in fuel exhaustion to all engine‘s. His
inattention resulted from preoccupation with a landing gear malfunction and
preparations for a possible landing emergency. Contributing to the accident was the failure of the other two flight
crewmembers either to fully comprehend the criticality of the fuel state or to
successfully communicate their concern to the captain. I

evidence that the captain had failed to assess the effect of continued holding on

3. CONCLUSIONS’ 3.1 Findings

l. Both engines of N55VM ceased to produce power because
the aircraft&#x27;s useable fuel supply was exhausted.

2. The crew failed to monitor adequately the fuel flow,
en route fuel consumption, and fuel quantity gages.

3. The crew failed to take appropriate preflight and
maintenance action to assure an adequate fuel supply for
the flight.

4, The crew operated the aircraft for an indeterminate
amount of time before the accident with the right
engine&#x27;s mixture control in the auto-rich position.

-~ 16 -

5. There were no discernible discrepancies between the
amounts of fuel added to the aircraft and the amounts
shown on the fuel receipts from the servicing facilities.

6. There was no evidence of a fuel leak.

7. There was no fire after impact because little
fuel remained in the aircraft&#x27;s fuel system.

8. The survival of many passengers was due to the lack
of severe impact deformation in the center of the
fuselage and the absence of a postcrash fire.

9. The provisions of the lease intended to satisfy the
requirement for a &quot;truth in leasing clause&quot; did not
result in this lessee having an adequate understanding
as to who was the operator of this flight and what that
means. 3.2 Probable Cause

The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the
probable cause of this accident was fuel exhaustion and total loss of power
on both engines due to crew inattention to fuel supply. Contributing to
the fuel exhaustion were inadequate flight planning and an engine malfunction of undetermined nature in the right engine which resulted in higherthan-normal fuel consumption. 4. SAFETY RECOMMENDATIONS

No safety recommendations were submitted as a result of this
accident. FAA issued Advisory Circular 91-37A on January 16, 1978, with
detailed guidance relative to leasing of aircraft. BY THE NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD

APPENDIX A INVESTIGATION Investigation

At 2025 e.s.t. on October 20, 1977, the National Transportation
Safety Board was notified of the accident by the FAA Communications
Center in Washington, D.C. An investigative team was dispatched immediately
to McComb, Mississippi, and working groups were established for operations,
human factors, structures, systems, powerplants, air traffic control,
witnesses, weather, and aircraft records. The Federal Aviation Administration, Convair Division of
General Dynamics, and Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft Group of United Technologies
participated in the investigation.</div>

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] Secondly, the aircraft may not have been fueled with the
amount shown on the fuel slips. The Safety Board considers this explanation
relatively remote because the fuel meters on refueling trucks cannot be
reset and, if functioning properly, will reflect the total amount of
fuel dispensed to a given aircraft. Finally, the engines or an engine could have been burning more
fuel than specified and more than the flightcrew expected to be burned. The witnesses report of torching from the right engine would indicate a
rich fuel mixture or other discrepancy associated with inadequate combustion. Operating an engine in the auto-rich configuration would increase the
fuel consumption by about 25 gallons per hour for that engine, from 183
gal/hr to 208 gal/hr. During the accident flight of 2.8 hours this
would have amounted to about 70 gallons. It is impossible to determine
how long the aircraft was operated with the right engine in auto-rich,
but it was evidently long enough to exhaust the useable fuel on board
the aircraft. Regardless of the high fuel consumption of the right
engine, the 5-hour, or 900+ gallon, fuel supply listed on the flight
pian would have been sufficient to reach the destination. Considering
the increased fuel consumption on the right engine, 583 gallons would
have been required to complete 2.8 hours of flight from Greenville to
the accident site. Therefore, the Safety Board concludes that the right
engine was burning more fuel than anticipated because it was being
operated in the auto-rich fuel mixture. The crew was either negligent or ignorant of the increased
fuel consumption because they failed to monitor adequately the engine
instruments for fuel flow and fuel quantity. Had they properly monitored
their fuel supply and noted excessive fuel consumption early in the
flight, they could have planned an alternate refueling stop rather than
attempting to continue flight with minimum fuel. In addition, the
Safety Board believes that the pilot was not prudent when he continued
the flight with a known engine discrepancy and did not have it corrected
before he left Greenville. This accident involves another operation where the party which
had operational responsibility is in controversy. It appears that it was
the intent of L &amp; J Company to have the operational responsibility assumed
by the lessee, Lynyrd Skynyrd Productions. The lessee, however, appears
to have had no understanding that it was the operator and had assumed
the responsibilities thereby imposed. The question of who was the legal
operator of this flight is currently being litigated by the FAA in an
enforcement action against L &amp; J Company and will be addressed in civil
litigation arising out of this accident. In examining this relationship, the Board reviewed the lease for
this flight.</div>

at the time of impact indicates that it was not under control or that
control had not been regained effectively before it crashed. Since the aircraft and powerplant were found to have been
operational before impact, the only remaining situation which could
have caused the loss of control of the aircraft would be passenger
movements or interference and airspeed bleedoff from an incorrect
flight control input while the pilot was being distracted from his primary duties. Passenger movement can be discounted since the passengers
were seated so closely together and any movement would have been
difficult after the aircraft became ai rborne. In addition, had the

he may have neglected to monitor the attitude of the aircraft relative

Board concludes that the pilot failed to adhere to safe operating
procedures by allowing his attention to be diverted to the degree

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] However, the differences are so diverse between the handling characteristics and
emergency procedures of single-engine and multiengine aircraft, applicants for
multiengine ratings who possess a single-engine instrument rating should be required to
demonstrate their ebility to conduct safe multiengine operat: wns under actual or
simulated instrument conditions, When an inflight emergency occurs, there is little time
to decide the proper action to be taken. A preestablished plan of action and a thorough
knowledge of the aircraft are requisites for the safe and efficient management of unusual,
unexpected deviations from normal flight conditions, especially when the p.lot is burdened
by the extra tasks associated with flight by instrument reference. The pilot had previously flown about 11 cross-country flights in NICOUV. His
longest flight was 1 8/10 hours. The average time for each cross-country flight was about
1 1/2 hours, It is possible that the pilot may have flown elther all or most of these flights
using only the main fuel tanks. Just as likely, however, is the possibility

that he may have been accustomed to switching to reserve fuel further along in the flight,
rather than shortly after leveling off. Since the amount of fuel onboard at takeoff, the
fuel tank selection, the fuel distribution within the tanks, and the pilot&#x27;s preferred
procedures for takeoff, climb, and cruise are matters of conjecture, no significant
conclusions could be drawn from the available fuel information. Additional evidence Indicates that the aircraft&#x27;s engine(s) may have stopped
because of fuel starvation. Witnesses reported hearing the aircraft making &quot;popping&quot;
noises, The engine manufacturer indicated that an interruption of fuel flow to a
Lycoming 10-720 engine could result in a popping noise or backfiring. At the first indication of abnormal engine operation, the pilot should have
advanced the mixture, prop, and throttle controls to the full rich/high RPM/high manifold
position. Having done so, he may have recognized his fuel inanagement error and
attempted to correct it by turning the fuel boost pumps on and selecting auxiliary fuel. Thv surge or increase in engine power as described by witnesses may have been due to the
resumption of fuel flow to the engines as a result of the pilot&#x27;s selection of auxiliary fuel. The fuel tank selectors and boost pumps were located on the fuel control
panel, which was located approximately 90° to the left and below the pilot&#x27;s view of the
primary flight instruments. Switching tanks would therefore have required the pilot to
move his head down and to the left, thus diverting his attention from flying the aircraft. If, while under actual instrument conditions, the pilot&#x27;s eyes were diverted
from the flight instruments and his head was moved downward and turned (as when
changing frequencies, checking flight log data, or changing fuel selectors), the aircraft
rolled or turned at the same time and he suddenly returned his head to the normal
position, a disorientation would most likely have occurred, A false sensation of diving or
rolling beyond the vertical plane would have been produced. AS a result, there may have
heen a strong, instinctive tencency to pitch or roll the aircraft in the opposite direction.</div>

The Safety Board determines that the probable cause of this accident
was the loss of effective engine power because of improper fel having
been placed in the tanks by relatively. untrained persomiel. A contributing
factor was that the flightcrew did not detect the error. 3. RECOMMENDATIONS

On the basis of this investigation, the Board has vecommended to the
Administrator, Federal Aviation Administration, that Parts 23, 25, 27 and
29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations and Advisory Circular 20-43a be
amended to provide a more adequate color coding system for aircraft

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] The Safety Board notes that the failure of the FAA to promptly and systematically
address these certification and operational issues resulted in the pilots of Comair flight 3272
being in a situation in which they lacked sufficient tools (autopilot bank angle warning, adjusted
stall warning/protection system, ice detection system, adequate deice procedures) and
information (airspeed guidance, hazards of thin rough ice accretions, and absence of ice
bridging) to operate safely. The Safety Board concludes that despite the accumulated lessons of
several major accidents and (in the case of the EMB-120) the specific findings of a staff
engineer, the FAA failed to adopt a systematic and proactive (rather than incremental and
reactive) approach to the certification and operational issues of turbopropeller-driven transport
airplane icing, which was causal to this accident.
 
188 As discussed in section 1.18.1.1, there have been five DC-9 series 10 airplane takeoff accidents
attributed to upper wing ice contamination in the United States since 1968. Although these accidents involved
turbojet-driven airplanes (not turbopropeller-driven airplanes, like the other icing-related incidents/accidents
discussed in this report), the issue of the FAA’s failure to address icing-related operational and certification issues is
pertinent to all airplanes certificated for flight in icing conditions.

2.6.2
Icing Certification Requirements
The Safety Board reviewed EMB-120 test data from the original certification of
the airplane for flight in icing conditions (U.S. and Canadian tests) and the subsequent SLD icing
certification tests, which were conducted in 1995 as a result of the ATR-72 accident near
Roselawn, Indiana. The Safety Board found no evidence that the EMB-120 did not satisfy the
tests to which it was subjected; in fact, during these tests, Embraer demonstrated the airplane’s
flight handling qualities under conditions that exceeded the boundaries of the Part 25 appendix C
envelope in terms of LWC. Despite the apparent fulfillment of all icing certification requirements by the
EMB-120, Comair flight 3272 crashed after apparently accreting a thin layer of rough,
“sandpaper-type” ice, in icing conditions that likely fell mostly within the boundaries of Part 25
appendix C, although droplets as large as 400 microns might have been present. Consequently, the Safety Board reviewed the adequacy of the current FAA
requirements for the certification of airplanes for flight in icing conditions. For an airplane to be
certificated for flight in icing conditions, the FAA requires the manufacturer to demonstrate a
limited number of test data points within the Part 25 appendix C envelope. The FAA’s icing
certification requirements are based on fully functioning and operating anti-icing and deicing
systems.</div>

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] The flight handling testing that occurred during the icing
certification process did not identify that control problems that were observed in the accident
airplane’s performance at an airspeed of about 156 knots (only 4 knots below the 160-knot
minimum speed for flight in icing conditions set by the FAA following the Comair accident)
with only a small amount of ice accreted on the deicing boots. It is possible that if the FAA had
required manufacturers to conduct tests with small amounts of rough-textured ice accreted on the
protected surfaces (as might occur before boot activation and between boot cycles) during icing
certification testing, the absence of an adequate safety margin above the stall speed would have
been identified. Further, the FAA could have ensured pilot awareness of icing and adequate stall
warning by requiring manufacturers to install ice detectors192 and stall warning systems with
reduced AOA thresholds for operations in icing conditions. Based on its concerns that the current icing certification standards did not require
testing for all realistic hazardous ice accretion scenarios, in its 1981 icing-related safety study,
the Safety Board recommended that the FAA review the adequacy of the 1950s-era Part 25
appendix C icing envelope, update the procedures for aircraft icing certification , and oversee the
manufacturers’ evaluations of aircraft performance in various icing conditions. The circumstances of the Comair flight 3272 accident demonstrated again the continuing need for these
FAA actions. The Safety Board considers the information that has been available regarding thin,
rough ice accretions sufficient to have prompted the FAA to require additional testing within
the appendix C envelope to demonstrate the effects of thin, rough ice as part of the icing
certification process. Had the FAA required such additional testing, the resultant information
regarding the stall margin and operational envelope of the EMB-120 might have been used to
define minimum airspeeds for operating the airplane in icing conditions. Therefore, based on its
 
192 Rosemount ice detectors were first used in military and transport-category airplanes in the early
1970s.

review of the history of icing information, the icing-related incident and accident history, the
EMB-120 initial icing certification data, the EMB-120 SLD icing controllability test results, and
the circumstances of this accident, the Safety Board concludes that the icing certification process
has been inadequate because it has not required manufacturers to demonstrate the airplane’s
flight handling and stall characteristics under a sufficiently realistic range of adverse ice
accretion/flight handling conditions. As a result of its investigation of the 1994 Roselawn accident, the Safety Board
issued Safety Recommendations A-96-54 and A-96-56 (currently classified “Open—Acceptable
Response”), which, respectively, stated that the FAA should do the following:
Revise the icing criteria published in 14 CFR Parts 23 and 25, in light of both
recent research into aircraft ice accretion under varying conditions of liquid
water content, drop size distribution, and temperature, and recent
developments in both the design and use of aircraft. Also, expand the
Appendix C icing certification envelope to include freezing drizzle/freezing
rain and mixed water/ice crystal conditions as necessary.</div>

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] Goodrich impingement study and NASA’s LEWICE program (see section 1.16.2) also predicted a sparse, rough ice
accretion aft of the deicing boot on the lower wing surface for some of the tested conditions. However, no ice
accretion aft of the deicing boot was noticed during the natural icing certification tests. (See section 2.5.1.)
Although it is possible that some of the drag observed in the accident airplane’s performance was the result of a
sparse, rough ice accumulation aft of the deicing boot on the lower wing surface, it was not possible to positively
determine whether the accident airplane’s ice accretion extended beyond the deicing boot coverage.

stitchlines. During tests conducted at a TAT of 26o F, a small, but prominent (½ inch) ridge of
ice frequently appeared on the forward portion (0.5 to 1 percent MAC) of the leading edge
deicing boot’s upper surface. The IRT test results were used in NASA’s computational studies, which indicated
that these pronounced ice ridges tended to act as stall strips, creating more disrupted airflow over
the airfoil’s upper surface, further decreasing the lift produced by the airfoil, and resulting in a
lower stall AOA than the rough ice accretions alone. NASA’s computational study data
indicated that a thin, rough ice accretion with a small, prominent ice ridge can result in a lower
stall AOA and a more dramatic drop off/break than the 3-inch ram’s horn ice shape commonly
used during initial icing certification testing. The implications of this finding for FAA icing
certification criteria are discussed in section 2.6.2.
The accident airplane’s performance displayed evidence of adverse effects on
both lift and drag during the airplane’s descent to 4,000 feet msl. The degradation exhibited by
the accident airplane was consistent with a combination of thin, rough ice accumulation on the
impingement area (including both upper and lower wing leading edge surfaces), with possible
ice ridge accumulation. Thus, based on its evaluation of the weather, radar, drag information,
CVR, existing icing research data, and postaccident icing and wind tunnel test information, the
Safety Board concludes that it is likely that Comair flight 3272 gradually accumulated a thin,
rough glaze/mixed ice coverage on the leading edge deicing boot surfaces, possibly with ice
ridge formation on the leading edge upper surface, as the airplane descended from 7,000 feet msl
to 4,000 feet msl in icing conditions; further, this type of ice accretion might have been
imperceptible to the pilots.</div>

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] The flightcrew&#x27;s apparent lack of concern regarding the prolonged
operations in icing conditions may have been influenced by their extensive
experience of safely flying commuter aircraft in winter weather conditions, especially
in icing conditions that are prevalent in the Great Lakes region. In addiction, they
were probably confident in the ability of the airplane deicing system to adequately
shed the ice that had been accumulating on the wings and in their ability to perform
safely under the existing circumstances. The flightcrew was operating in icing
conditions that exceeded the limits set forth in 14 CFR Part 25, Appendix C,
resulting in a complete loss of aircraft control. However, the insidious nature of
these icing conditions was such that the ice accumulation on the observable portions
of the wings, windshield and other airframe parts was most likely perceived by the
flightcrew as nonthreatening throughout the holding period. Moreover, the
flightcrew was undoubtedly unaware that the icing conditions exceeded the
Appendix C limits and most likely had operated in similar conditions many times
prior to the accident, since such conditions occur frequently in the winter throughout
the Great Lakes and northeastern parts of the United States.

193
Further, the flightcrew entered the holding pattern with the belief that
the holding would be of a short duration, unaware that it would be continually
extended in short increments for a total of 39 minutes. Therefore, the Safety Board
concludes that if a significant amount of ice had accumulated on the wing leading
edges so as to burden the ice protection system, or if the crew had been able to
observe the ridge of ice building behind the deice boots or otherwise been provided a
means of determining that an unsafe condition could result from holding in those
icing conditions, it is probable that they would have exited the conditions. The Safety Board is aware that ATR provided information to the
operators of its airplanes that indicated that encounters with certain freezing
precipitation conditions could result in “roll axis anomalies.” However, this
information was vague and did not indicate to flightcrews how to determine that they
were in freezing rain, nor did it specifically alert them that encounters with freezing
rain could result in sudden autopilot disconnects, uncommanded aileron movements
and rapid roll excursions. Therefore, the crew of flight 4184 had no reason to expect
that the icing conditions in which they were operating could cause the autopilot to
disconnect unexpectedly because of the onset of an aileron hinge moment reversal
and cause a loss of normal, stable aileron control. In addition, ATR did not provide,
nor did the regulatory authorities require, training or guidance to pilots about the roll
axis “anomalies” or the recovery techniques if such an event should occur. Thus, the
Safety Board concludes that the crew of flight 4184 was not provided with adequate
information by the manufacturer or the regulatory authorities to recognize and cope
with the problems they experienced during an encounter with freezing rain.</div>

caution alert, it is possible that it was activated by one of the other aircraft systems. Assuming the chime at 1533:56 was activated by the ice detection system, consistent
with the drag increase noted at that time on the FDR, the Safety Board concludes that
the flightcrew’s failure to increase the propeller RPM to 86 percent and activate the
Level III ice protection system was not a factor in the accident because: 1) according
to ATR, the increased propeller RPM is necessary to increase the ice shedding
capabilities of the propeller blades; 2) the increased propeller RPM will prevent the
formation of ice aft of the deice boots in the area of the propeller slipstream, but will
not prevent the formation of ice on the wing in the areas behind the deice boots, in
front of the ailerons, or the airflow over the ailerons. There was no discussion recorded on the CVR to suggest that the flight
crewmembers had a safety concern about the icing conditions in which they were

191
holding. Two comments by the crewmembers recorded on the CVR indicated they
were aware that ice was accreting on the airframe. The first comment, “I’m showing
some ice,” occurred about 9 minutes before the initial upset of the airplane, and the
second comment, “we still got ice” occurred about 2 minutes before the upset. Neither comment indicated the type or amount of ice, nor did the comments suggest
that the crew was aware the ice accretions were related to an encounter with freezing
drizzle or freezing rain. The comments only indicate that the flightcrew was aware
that they were operating in an icing environment. Further, the flightcrew responded
appropriately to the caution alert at 1541:07 by increasing the propeller RPM to 86
percent and activating the deice boots 5 seconds later, or about 16 minutes before the
upset. Although AMR Eagle cautioned pilots in its 1989 memorandum about
flight in freezing rain, the information and training provided by Simmons
Airlines/AMR Eagle to its flightcrews did not prohibit holding in icing conditions
that were perceived to be within the capabilities of the airplane. In addition, the crew
did not have specific training or information necessary to determine that the airplane
was operating in conditions (freezing rain) beyond those for which it had been
certificated. It is generally understood that flight in icing conditions in any aircraft at
low airspeeds with the flaps and/or the landing gear extended for a long period of
time is not a good operating practice because such exposure increases the likelihood
of a significant accumulation of ice on the flaps and/or landing gear, which could
result in increases in weight and drag, and a decrease in aircraft performance.</div>

                        <div class="chunk-text">[CONCLUSIONS &gt; FINDINGS] The 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 25, Appendix C,
envelope is limited and does not include conditions of freezing drizzle
or freezing rain; thus, the current process by which aircraft are certified
using the Appendix C icing envelope is inadequate and does not
require manufacturers to sufficiently demonstrate the airplane&#x27;s
capabilities in all the possible icing conditions that can, and do, occur
in nature.
14. No airplane should be authorized or certified for flight into icing
conditions more severe than those to which the airplane was subjected
in certification testing, unless the manufacturer can otherwise
demonstrate the safety of flight in such conditions.
15. If the FAA had acted more positively upon the Safety Board&#x27;s aircraft
icing recommendations issued in 1981, this accident may not have
occurred.

205
16. ATR 42 and 72 ice-induced aileron hinge moment reversals, autopilot
disconnects, and rapid, uncommanded rolls could occur if the airplanes
are operated in near freezing temperatures and water droplet median
volume diameter (MVDs) typical of freezing drizzle.
17. At the initiation of the aileron hinge moment reversal affecting flight
4184, the 60 pounds of force on the control wheel required to maintain
a wings-level-attitude were within the standards set forth by the Federal
Aviation Regulations. However, rapid, uncommanded rolls and the
sudden onset of 60 pounds of control wheel force without any warning
to the pilot, or training for such unusual events, would most likely
preclude a flightcrew from making a timely recovery.
18. ATR is considering design changes to the lateral control system for
current and future ATR airplanes that will reduce the susceptibility to
flow separation-induced aileron hinge moment reversals. Such design
changes could minimize the reliance on the changes to flight operations
and pilot training that have already been mandated.
19. The French Directorate General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) and the
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) failed to require the
manufacturer to provide documentation of known undesirable postSPS [stall protection system] flight characteristics, which contributed
to their failure to identify and correct, or otherwise properly address,
the abnormal aileron behavior early in the history of the ATR icing
incidents.
20. The addition of a test procedure, similar to the &quot;zero G&quot; flight test
maneuver (pushover) designed to identify ice-induced elevator hinge
moment reversals, could determine the susceptibility of an aircraft to
aileron hinge moment reversals in both the clean and iced-wing
conditions and could help prevent accidents such as the one involving
flight 4184.
21. Prior to the Roselawn accident, ATR recognized the reason for the
aileron behavior in the previous incidents and determined that ice
accumulation behind the deice boots, at an AOA sufficient to cause an
airflow separation, would cause the ailerons to become unstable. Therefore, ATR had sufficient basis to modify the airplane and/or

206
provide operators and pilots with adequate, detailed information
regarding this phenomenon.

observation was taken three minutes after secding had commenced,
this was too early to have been affected by the one lane of dry ice
that had been dispensed to the west of the field. The only reason
for seeding the morning of 26 December was because of the ceiling at
100 feet.

“Once fall out begins during a seeding operation, the available liquid
moisture in the atmosphere is rapidly diminisked. Therefore, during
the period of 0545 to 0617 on 26 December 1968, approximately 30

to 60 minutes after the completion of seeding operations, as

evidenced by the visibility, icing conditions would have been highly
improbable. Not only was the visibility better than on the morning

of 29 December prior to seeding, but the majority of the water
droplets had become ice crystals and fallen to the ground by 0545L.&quot;

The Board generally concurs with the project director&#x27;s analysis of
the icing conditions that were prevalent on the morning of December 26,
1968. Thus, we believe that no more than a trace of airframe icing was
likely to have been encountered. This assumption can also be supported
by the statement of a pilot who departed Elmendorf in a C-141 at 0612
and indicated that there was no ice, snow, or frost on his aircraft&#x27;s
exterior. The closed position of the engine anti-icing valves that were
recovered indicated that engine anti-icing was not being used at the
time of impact. Since there is a reference on the CVR tape to &quot;nacelles&quot; at a
point on the pre-taxi portion of the checklist where this item would
normally be checked, it can be assumed that anti-‘ce was considered,
Either it was decided not to use engine anti-ice or, if turned on, it was
turned off before starting the takeoff roll. In any case, if some engine
ice did form pricr to the takeoff, there would have been a drop in turbine
discharge pressure or engine pressure ratio. This drop would have been
reflected on the engine instruments. The absence of any comment on the CVR
tape concerning instrument readings and the &quot;routine&quot; callout of the air
Speeds by the captain during the takeoff roll, indicated that the aircraft
was accelerating at the expected rate. The fact that it was necessary to push the No. 4 engine fan reverser
to the closed position while the aircraft was parked at the ramp is not
considered to be a causal factor in this accident. The maintenance
Supervisor who assisted in this operation ascertained that the reverser
warning light in the cockpit was out indicating the fan reverser was in
the proper stowed position. The outbound flightcrew was aware of the
condition of this reverser having discussed the problem with the arriving
captain. In addition, the CVR tape revealed nothing that would indicate
the crew of Flight 799 had experienced any difficulty with the reverser
systeu.

ground navigation aids, including the ARTCC radar and communications
equipment,

The aircraft&#x27;s gross weight at takeoff exceeded the maximurn
limits established by the owner&#x27;s manual; however, -ne load was distributed in the aircraft so that the center of gravity was within established
limits. The center of gravity stayed within established limits as fuel
was conaumed and the aircraft&#x27;s gross weight decreased. The Safety
Board could nut deterrnine the distribution or the amount of ice that had
accumulated on the aircraft. The evidence indicated that the pliot could maintain straight
and leve] flight. The rnajor problem was his inability to regain altitude
after he had descended tu 3,000 feet during the approach to Lonesome
Pine. The evidence relating to the powerplants indicates that full
engine power wa3 available and was being use’. The Safety Board
could not determine the specific engire malfunction being descrihed
by the pilot; however, it is possibla that induction icing caused the
malfunction, Since the fucl (right engine) selector was found set on
the left main fuel tank, the pilot may have telieved that he had a fuelflow problein and decided tc operate both engines from the left tank,
However, both propellers were in the high rpm range and showed
evidence of relatively high rotational speed at impact. The tree damage
attributed to propeller slashes indicated that the engines were developing relatively high powe-.

The first communication problems were encountered at 1728,
when the pilot changed communications frequencies, However, there
were other cornmunications prollems later in the flight; these may
have been caused by icing of the: aircraft radio antennas, by signal
obstruction by high terrain, or by some unidentified problems with the
aircraft&#x27;s radios. Additionally, the pilot twice reported difficulty in
recniving VOR stations; however, as he came closes to the stations,
he was able to receive them and used them for navigation. After the pilot first reported icing at 1904, about 46 minutes
before che crash, the remainder of the flight was flown in conditions
conducive to svructural icing. The aircraft was equipped with vacuumoperated deicing boots on all the leading edges and an electric deicing
system on the propellers, The pilot did not mnention veing these devices and the Safety Board was not able to determine irom the wreckage
whether they had been used. Clear ice caused by freezing rain can cover all the upper
surfaces of an aircraft in flight and the deicing equipment will remove
only the ice in the area of the equipment, Because the propellers were
dej:ed by electrical heating of the boot, there probably was little, if
any, ice on the propellers and they retained their efficiency. The
vacuum-operated deicing boots on the leading edges of the airfoils would
be able to remove only that ice immediately adjacent to and on the boot,
leaving a large area of the airfoils subject to ice accretion, This la.ter
ice could only be removed by operating the aircraft in an area where
the ambient temperature would melt the ice.</div>

J), The maximum gro3s takeoff weight was exceeded
at takeoff; the center of gravity was within limits. The weight and balance cannot be computed for the
time of the impact because the amount and distribution of airframe icing cannot be determined.

2. There is no evidence of a preimpact malfunction of
either powerplant. Both engines were developing
relatively high power when the aircraft struck the
trees.

3, The flight operated in conditions conducive to airframe and induction icing for about 46 minutes.

4. The Safety Board coule not determine if the installed
deicing equipment was used or if the equipment was
used properly,

5. The pilot planned, initiated, and continued a night
IFR flight in an area of thunderstormis ard forecasted and reported icing.

6. The communications difficulties experienced by the
pilot probably resulted from a combination of ice
accretion on the aircraft radio antennas and terrain
interference at the lower flight altitudes.

7. The pilot&#x27;s ability to make a decision was degraded
by the stress cf the numereus problerns he encountered,

&amp; While the air traffic control personnel provided
assistance to the pilot in accordance with their under -
standing of the established prcecedures, the controllers
failed to seek specific information regarding the degrees
of deterioration of the pilot&#x27;s and the aircraft&#x27;s abilities
to deal with the adverse conditions. (b) Probable Cause

The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the
probable cause of the acciden: was a controlled collision with the terrain,
while the flight was receiving radar vectors in night IMC conditions,
because structural icing prevented the pilot from climbing to a safe
altitude. Contributing to the accident were the pilot&#x27;s failure to appreciate the severity ci the weather he could expect to encounter and to take
the initiative to divert the flight vefore his options were reduced, and the
controllers&#x27; failures to take more timely and forceful action to seek more
specific infermation regarding the degree of deterioration of the pilot&#x27;s
and aircraft&#x27;s ability to deal with the adverse conditions.

3, RECOMMENDATIONS

The Safety Board recommends that pilots and controllers study
the circumstancas of this accident and decide how they could have r2sponded to the conditions involved in this flight in a way that would have
prevented the accident. Pilots, as certificated airmen, must understand the importance
of a thorough preflight weather analysis, particularly with respect to
forecasted and known icing conditions or other severe weather along the
intended route of flight, Pilots should know and heed the precautions
and operating limitations set forth in the airplane owner&#x27;s manual,
aircraft operating manual, and other approved operating instructions. Pilots should plan their flights with regard to those precautions and
operating limitations and avoid encounters with icing or other severe
weather. Pilots should be conservative in their decisions to exercise
the privileges of their airman&#x27;s certificutes and consider their level of
experience, recency of experience, the aircraft&#x27;s capability, and pilot
workload before committing themselves to a flight. It is extremely
important that pilot&#x27;s carefully weigh the need to complete the flight

against the potential hazards of attempting the flight.</div>

asked the FAA to do the following: 
Revise the icing criteria published in 14…CFR Parts 23 and 25, in light of both
recent research into aircraft ice accretion under varying conditions of liquid water
content, drop size distribution, and temperature, and recent developments in both
the design and use of aircraft. Also, expand the Appendix C icing certification

Aircraft Accident Report
Further, icing tunnel tests conducted as part of the Comair flight 3272 accident
investigation indicated that the effects of ice accretion on airplane performance could vary
widely depending on the size, distribution, and type of ice accumulated on the airplane’s
surfaces. However, the Board learned that manufacturers are not required to demonstrate
an airplane’s flight handling characteristics or stall margins using thin, rough ice that can
accrete on protected surfaces before the activation of the deice boot system or between
activation cycles. As a result of its findings, the Board issued Safety Recommendation
A-98-92, which asked the FAA (in cooperation with NASA and other interested aviation
organizations) to do the following:
[C]onduct additional research to identify realistic ice accumulations and …
determine the effects and criticality of such ice accumulations … the information
developed … should be incorporated into aircraft certification requirements. The Safety Board also issued Safety Recommendation A-98-100, which asked the
FAA to review the icing certification of all turbopropeller-driven airplanes currently
certificated for operation in icing conditions, perform additional testing, and take action as
required to ensure that these airplanes fulfill the requirements of the revised icing
certification standards asked for in Safety Recommendation A-98-92. The

Recommendation A-96-54 that the ARAC IPHWG is continuing to develop a revision to
Part 25 to require a demonstration that an airplane can safely operate in SLD conditions
for an unrestricted time or can detect SLD and safely exit icing conditions. However, the

Accident Sequence
2.2.1 Descent Into Icing Conditions
Surface observations and radar data indicated that freezing drizzle conditions
existed in the PUB area around the time of the accident and that temperatures were below
freezing from the surface to 30,000 feet. Several PIREPs and NWS products transmitted
around the time of the accident, including winter weather advisories that warned of
freezing drizzle, confirmed the presence of icing conditions in the PUB area. CVR Analysis
28
Aircraft Accident Report
evidence indicates that, starting about 0851, the flight crew began taking actions to
minimize the icing’s hazardous effects, such as activating the airplane’s engine and
windshield anti-ice systems. About 4 minutes later, the first officer stated that he saw a
little bit of “grayish ice,” which is indicative of ice that has a rough surface, building up on
the wing leading edges. He then stated that there was “a real thin line back there.” 
An analysis of the CVR and meteorological information indicated that mixed icing
conditions existed from about 21,000 to 14,000 feet. Radar data and CVR information
indicated that the airplane was in this icing layer for about 5 1/2 minutes. At 0858:20, as
the airplane was descending through about 18,000 feet, the first officer suggested to the
captain that he might want to cycle the deice boots.54 After cycling the deice boots, the
captain indicated that the deice boots might have shed a little of the ice but that some ice
remained on the wing, indicating the presence of residual ice. 
2.2.2 Approach to Landing 
In accordance with the SimuFlite Cessna Citation V Technical Manual and the
Cessna Model 560 Citation V AFM, pilots were trained that, when any residual ice is
present or can be expected during approach and landing, Vref must be increased by 8 knots. The manuals also contained both a caution and a warning indicating that stall speeds
increased during operations in icing conditions, and that, therefore, Vref must be increased. At 0859:29, the CVR recorded the first officer state that the Vref was 96 knots. In
the case of this flight, the Vref should have been increased from 96 to 104 knots because of
the icing conditions. The CVR did not record either pilot mention increasing the airspeed
at any point during the approach.</div>

determination of the aerodynamic effect of ice on 4 specific airfoil is not a requirement in the certification of the aircraft. Even if this were a requirement, it would be virtually impossible
to determine the aerodynamic penalties of the various shapes and
textures of ice that may be accumulated in flight. Studies conducted by the National advisory Commtt tee for
Aeronautics and later by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Féederal Aviation Administration publications, and the textbooks previously cited, have confirmed that airfoil icing does
result in aerodynamic penalties and that, {{n general, these penalties
result in higher etall speeds and lower stall angles of attack,

In view of the foregoing, the Board conctudes that airfoil
{{cing existed to such an extent that substantial aerodynamic penalties were imposed, These penalties, while not precluding the aircraft from becoming airborne and briefly establishing a positive
rate of climb in ground effect, resulted in a stall as soon as it
lost the advantage of ground effect, Accordingly, except for
ground effect, the aircraft probably would not have become airborne
under the existing circumstances, I -

The experience level of the flightcrew in this aodel aircraft
was minimal, However, the Board believes that the relatively low
level of experience should not have been a factor in the accident,
since icing effect on the airfoils of an aircraft is basic knowledge
required of all certificated pilots, While ice is more critical on
a thin swept-wing aircraft, the same basic precautions are applicable
to all aircraft regardless of airfoil design. The Board concluded that the validity of information provided
by the speed command system and the stall warning. system with an
iced airfoil is questionable, A stall can occur with an iced airfoil at a lower angle of attack than that programaed for the stall
warning system and, under extreme icing conditions, the validity of
the information provided by the speed command system becones questionable, However, proper use of the airfoil antisice system and proper
deicing of aircraft prior tc departure would éliminate this opera-.
tional consideration, I

The popping and torching of the engine near the time of the
stall resulted from engine compressor stalls caused by the crew&#x27;s
manipulation of the throttles during their attempted recovery and
subsequent abandonment of the takeoff, and disturbed engine inlet
airflow resulting from the stabled attitude of the aircraft. This
phenomenon has beén observed in other jet aircraft accidents.</div>

2.1 General 
The captain and the first officer were certificated in accordance with Federal regulations 
and were current and qualified in accordance with Empire Airlines’ training requirements. The 
investigation found no evidence that the pilots’ performance was affected by any behavioral or 
medical condition, or by the use of alcohol or drugs. The airplane was loaded within weight and CG limits and was maintained in accordance 
with 14 CFR Part 121. Although Empire Airlines could not immediately locate the left engine’s 
AD records, work orders and other records were located that indicated the AD compliance items 
had been performed. The investigation found no evidence that indicated any mechanical anomaly 
with the engines, and FDR data indicated that the engines’ performance was consistent with 
normal operations. The flight experienced two separate periods of airframe ice accretion, the first during 
cruise flight at FL 180 and the second during descent below 6,000 feet msl. The flight crew 
selected ice protection during both icing encounters, and no evidence indicated any mechanical 
anomalies with the airplane’s deicing and anti-icing systems. According to the captain, following 
the first icing encounter, during the descent above 6,000 feet msl, “substantial amounts of ice” 
came off the airplane. The shedding of ice is consistent with the presence of a layer of air with 
temperatures above freezing between 6,000 and 11,000 feet msl due to a temperature inversion. Further, performance calculations based on FDR data indicated that, during the descent between 
14,000 to about 5,000 feet msl, the airplane’s performance was as expected for an ice-free 
airframe. During the approach into LBB, the airplane began to accumulate ice again when it 
descended into moderate icing conditions resulting from light freezing drizzle, a weather 
condition that was outside its icing certification envelope as specified in 14 CFR Part 25, 
Appendix C.92 
During the approach as the airplane descended through about 4,800 feet msl, the FDR 
recorded that a flap asymmetry occurred about 1 second after the cockpit flap position lever was 
positioned to command 15° flaps. The FDR recorded no operational anomalies with the 
airplane’s hydraulic systems, and the flight crew reported none. Performance data indicated that, 
when the flight crew commanded 15° flaps, a flap asymmetry occurred with the left flaps 
extending 8° to 10° and the right flaps not extending. The data further indicated that the flaps 
returned to a symmetric state (about 4.5°) about 25 seconds before ground impact. Based on the circumstances of the accident flight, a number of scenarios could have 
resulted in a flap asymmetry, and the investigation evaluated the possibility that a mechanical 
anomaly, flap actuator jamming, mechanical restriction of the movement of the right flaps, or 
hydraulic fluid contamination may have occurred.</div>

NTSB 
Aircraft Accident Report 
20. Dispatching and operating an airplane in known icing conditions for which the airplane is not 
certificated and has not demonstrated the ability to operate safely has the potential to reduce 
or eliminate safety margins. 
21. To most effectively ensure the safety of flight operations in icing conditions, pilots, 
dispatchers, and flight followers must understand how the dangers of freezing drizzle and 
freezing rain can affect their airplanes and must understand the differences between ground 
deicing considerations and in-flight icing operations. 
22. The presence of ice on the taxiways between the aircraft rescue and firefighting station and 
the accident site minimally increased the response time; however, the emergency response 
was timely and effective in suppressing the fire. 
23. Timely information from the flight crew about the safety of the airplane occupants and the 
presence of on-board hazardous materials cargo would improve the safety and efficiency of 
the emergency response. 
24. Because flight crews cannot always immediately communicate with air traffic control after 
an accident, it is important that another method be developed to communicate information, 
such as the number of occupants on board and the presence of hazardous materials, to aircraft 
rescue and firefighting personnel upon initial notification of an accident. 
25. An iced and inoperable mutual aid gate could extend the response time of mutual aid, which 
could delay the delivery of medical attention to accident survivors and result in further fire 
damage to property. 
26. The aircraft performance monitoring system is a valuable low-airspeed alerting tool that can 
enhance safety in all icing conditions. 
27. If the accident aircraft had been equipped with a flap asymmetry light, as many other 
ATR 42- and ATR 72-series airplanes are equipped, the illumination of that light would likely 
have made the nature of the malfunction more salient to the flight crew and may have 
triggered a more appropriate crew response. 
28. The absence of an ice evidence probe, which was an optional installation, did not hinder the 
flight crew’s ability to detect airframe ice accretion. 
29. Simulator-based training scenarios that realistically reflect aircraft performance degradations 
that result from airframe ice accretion can better prepare flight crews to effectively respond 
to decaying airspeed situations and other situations that can occur during in-flight icing 
encounters.

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] The excessive duration of the flight
in such conditions, with no recorded comments (as shown by the CVR
transcript) on the severity of the icing, nor any upon the procedures to be
applied in the conditions, seems incomprehensible on the part of the
flightcrew. Another major element is the domain of aircraft certification in icing
conditions. The reference is appendix C of JAR - JAR 25 regulation, which
sets the certification limits. This regulation does not consider the existence
of supercooled droplets or drops having a diameter over 40µm (continuous
maximum atmospheric icing conditions) with a liquid water content over
0.8 g/m3 in the cloud layer nor the case of freezing drizzle or freezing rain.
174

Thus the BEA&#x27;s study points up the following five findings :
1. 
According to the content of the flight release, the crew was aware of
the existence of light to moderate icing on the Indianapolis - Chicago route
at the levels at which they were flying.
2. 
In an available AIRMET, valid before and for the flight, rainfall was
forecast at the altitude of Flight 4184 with negative air temperatures.
3. 
Precipitation was detectable on the airborne radar on WX position.
4. 
The flight in the holding pattern lasted over 30 minutes in a cloudy
atmosphere with liquid precipitation and at a SAT varying betwwen -2 and -
4°C. This was in complete contradiction with the limits specified in the
certification and operational procedures.
5. 
Procedures relative to flights in icing conditions, specifically those
related to the surveillance of environment, static temperature, ice
indicators, and detectors, as well as some visual cues, were not respected by
the flightcrew. In addition, standard procedures relating to propellor speed
adjustment and anti-icing and de-icing system activation in icing conditions
were not properly applied. In conclusion, overall crew vigilance and awareness did not correspond to
the basic rules to be applied on such a flight, occurring in icing conditions
conducive to ice accretion.
175

2.2.1. HOLDING TECHNIQUE
The holding pattern is flown with Auto-Pilot in the Altitude-Hold Mode. Under these conditions, the airspeed must be maintained by manual
adjustment of the engine torque. It is observed that throughout the entire
holding patterns the number of these adjustments is very limited. As a
consequence, airspeed variations of more than 10 knots are noticed during
each holding turn, leading the airspeed to decay marginally below the
minimum authorized speed (Vm HBO-icing) which was computed at 165 Kt
for this holding. Utilization of higher holding speeds, which could have been authorized by
the Air Traffic Controller, would have minimized the crew’s feeling related
to the aircraft “wallowing in the air”, even during the phases where airspeed
was reduced as the result of their limited power adjustments. This higher
holding speed would have precluded the flight crew’s ad hoc decision to use
a different flap setting than the one provided for in the aircraft manuals and
which was initially selected by the crew. This would have increased the
safety margin with the minimum authorized speed while eliminating the
risk of inadvertently reaching the maximum authorized speed limit.</div>

                        <div class="chunk-text">[CONCLUSIONS] At that time the conclusion was that unusual ice accretion
patterns may have been caused by the speculated aircraft’s sustained flight
in freezing rain conditions, and it was concluded that such conditions could
have been the origin of an aileron hinge moment modification which
occurred about at the stall threshold when the autopilot disconnected. However, the absence of documented freezing rain ice shapes and of any
industry standards for such ice accretions gave no basis to support or test
such speculation. Several other factors limited any further analysis of this
matter by ATR, or by any other party involved in the investigation, including
the NTSB.
220

a) 
The worldwide industry belief that freezing rain conditions, which are
beyond the certification envelope of all aircraft, were rare occurrences, and
that it would be impractical to protect aircraft against their effects. Further,
it was believed that such conditions were generally “predictable,
recognizable and avoidable” [AC 20.117].
b) The absence of certification criteria to cover the consequences of
inadvertent encounters and the absence of documented effects in terms of
ice accretion patterns.
c) 
The fact that the event occurred at about the stall threshold, which was
further addressed by the vortex generators modification.
d) The fact that the crew had failed to activate the airframe de-icing
equipment at the time, which fact was revealed by the NTSB to the other
investigating parties after the manufacturer’s analysis was published, was an
aggravating factor in the incident. Application of the normal and required
de-icing procedures for flight in icing conditions may well have prevented
the incident.
e) The fact that the crew had not reported abnormal or excessive wheel
efforts during the recovery and that the aileron effectiveness had apparently
remained unaffected. In the frame of the post-Roselawn accident investigation, the BEA made
further inquiries about potential similarities between the ATR 42 Mosinee
incident and the ATR 72 Roselawn accident and considered whether
additional efforts might have allowed the investigating parties at that time to
anticipate the Roselawn icing scenario.
221

Several factors made the ice accretion patterns involved in the Mosinee
incident, significantly different from those that most probably developed in
the Roselawn case, the first of which being the fact that aircraft S/N 91
accreted ice with the airframe de-icing boots OFF. Also, aircraft S/N 91
accreted ice in the flaps 0° configuration ; droplets sizes associated with the
prevailing freezing rain conditions were probably higher than those involved
in Roselawn ; the exposure time was not longer than 10 minutes. These
differences resulted in ice accretion patterns with both large spanwise and
chordwise extents on the wing airfoil and with limited protruding ridge
height. Although such shapes cannot be accurately characterized, the BEA
believes that their nature may not be very different from one of the Edwards
tanker test cases, with the wing de-icer boots inoperative (test n°23)
exhibited.</div>

accident site, thus suggesting that it was in that position prior to impact, although
it is possible that the knob was out and impact forces moved the knob forward
without bending the rod. The pilot’s failure to stop at the end of the runway
before his takeoff roll, which would have been the most common and appropriate
time to adjust the fuel/air mixture, further suggests that he did not properly lean
the mixture. Further, carburetor icing conditions existed at the time of takeoff (the
temperature was 40 degrees, the dew point was 32 degrees, and there was moisture
in the air). Thus, without the application of carburetor heat during taxi and runup,
ice may have formed in the carburetor and reduced the available power at takeoff. The carburetor heat valve was found in the “off” position at the accident site. The
pilot’s failure to stop at the end of the runway before his takeoff roll suggests that
he did not perform a pretakeoff checklist, which would have included a magneto
and carburetor heat check (turning on the carburetor heat.) However the Safety
Board could not conclusively determine its position during the takeoff sequence. Either or both of these conditions could have reduced the engine
power sufficiently to cause a loss of climb capability. However, because the
settings of the mixture control knob and the carburetor heat valve during the
takeoff could not be determined positively, the Safety Board cannot conclusively
determine whether a power reduction from an over-rich mixture and/or carburetor
icing existed at the time of the accident. ASOS ceilometer data and eyewitness reports indicate that the cloud
bases in the accident area were probably around 1,500 feet agl. Additionally,
numerous eyewitnesses stated that the airplane was visible until the accident. Personnel in the tower, about 1.2 nautical miles from the accident location,
observed the accident sequence. The Safety Board concludes that although horizontal in-flight
visibility at the time of the stall was most likely substantially degraded due to
precipitation, eliminating a visible horizon, the pilot in command could have
maintained visual ground reference by looking out the side window. However,
this could have been disorienting to the pilot because of the need to scan to his left
to see flight instruments in front of the pilot trainee and to his right to see the
ground, as he attempted to operate the airplane at low speed, with a lower-than-

39
normal climb rate, with the distraction of rain and ice impacting the airplane, and
in instrument meteorological conditions. Analysis of weather data indicate that the winds were generally
westerly at the surface and near-surface at speeds that varied between 15 and 30
knots.</div>

The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of this accident

was the captain&#x27;s failure to have the airplane deiced a second time after a delay before takeoff that
{{ed to upper wing surface contamination and a loss of.control during. rapid takeoff rotation by the
first officer. Contributing to the accident were the absence of regulatory or management controls
governing operations by newly qualified flight crewmembers and the confusion that existed
between the flightcrew and air traffic controllers that led to the delay in departure. -

’ 4. RECOMMENDATIONS

Asa result of its investigation, the Safety Board made the following recommendations:

~-to the Federal Aviation Administration:

Until such time that guidelines for detecting upper wing surface icing can be
incorporated into the airplane flight manual, issue an air carrier operations
bulletin directing all principal operations inspectors to require that all McDonnell
Douglas DC-9-10 series operators anti-ice airplanes with maximum effective
strength glycol solution when icing conditions exist. (Class II, Priority Action)
(A-88- 134) -

Expedite the evaluation of the effectiveness of Association of European Airlines
guidelines concerning the use of European types I and II deicing and anti-icing
fluids. If European methodology is more effective than current U.S.
methodology, incorporate their guidelines into the next version of Advisory
Circular 200-17. (Class Il, Priority Action) (A-88- 135)

Require all DC-9-10 series operators to establish detailed procedures for
detecting upper wing ice before takeoff. (Class !!, Priority Action) (A-88- 136)

Establish minimum experience levels for each pilot-in-command and second-incommand pilot, and require the use of such criteria to prohibit the pairing on the
same flight of pilots who have less than the minimum experience in their
respective positions. (Class I!, Priority Action) (A-88- 137)

Amend 14 CFR 121.434 to require that a second-in-command pilot complete
initial operating experience for that position while actually performing the
duties of a second-in-command under the supervision of a check pilot. (Class II,
Priority Action) (A-88- 138)

Review and revise, as necessary, the engineer performance standards ‘for
appropriate airports to account for the reduced airport capacities that occur
when deicing operations are in progress. (Class Il, Priority Action) (A-88- 139)

Initiate a research project to acquire data from dedicated sensors to determine
what consideration, if any, should be given to wake vortices in a parallel offset
runway situation. (Class Il, Priority Action) (A-88-140)

Require commercial! operators to conduct substantive background checks of pilot
applicants which include verification of personal flight records and examination
of training, performance, and disciplinary records of previous employers and
Federal Aviation Administration safety and enforcement records. (Class Il,
Priority Action) (A-88-141)

Issue an airworthiness directive to require more complete operating instructions
on the exterior side of the tailcone exit hatch of DC-9 airplanes.</div>

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] Surges also have been noted on CVR
recordings from accidents with no wing contamination. These surges occurred when the intakes:
were no longer aligned with the relative wind during dynamic maneuvering of the airplane, causing
compressor blades to stall and subsequent surges. In all instances, the surges were the effect rather
than the cause. Consequently, engine compressor surges were not a causal factor in this accident. The lack of leading edge devices on the wings of the DC-9 airplane make it more vulnerable to
performance degradation due to wing contamination; however, the Safety Board believes that the
FAA and McDonnell-Douglas have adequately warned DC-9-10 series operators of such possible
degraded flight characteristics through AC 20-117 and several articles on airframe contamination in
McDonnell-Douglas publications.7 In general, McDonnel!-Douglas provided guidance for carefully
inspecting for “almost undetectable amounts of ice,&quot; and the FAA regulations require that airfoil

surfaces be free of contamination” before takeoff, which is adequately specific information for
operators. Finally, airplane certification requirements for performance are based on airfoil surfaces
that are not contaminated by ice, snow, or frost. The Safety Board has investigated three previous DC-9-10 series icing-related accidents which
were similar-to the circumstances of the accident involving flight 1713.8 In two of the accidents, ice
was visible to the crews before takeoff; in the other accident, the crew failed to examine the wings
before takeoff. The Safety Board believes that the November 15, 1987, accident again demonstrates
that even small amounts of contamination on the upper surfaces of an airplane can seriously
degrade lift. This accident underscores the critical importance for the pilot-in-command to ensure
the surfaces are clean before every takeoff when in conditions conducive to contamination. The
crew of flight 1713 also failed to examine the wings for contamination before takeoff. Therefore,
the Safety Board believes that there is no justification for questioning the FAA certification of a
DC-9-10 series airplane.

2.8 The First Officer&#x27;s Actions During Rotation

The first officer&#x27;s poor rotation technique probably contributed to the loss of airplane control. Evidence of trouble during the takeoff rotation was apparent from data recovered from the FDR. The altitude dip associated with pitch rotation in a DC-9-14 airpiane is normally about 50 to 60 feet

below field elevation, consistent with a pitch angle of about 6° during liftoff. Under normal .

circumstances, the magnitude of the dip is porportional to the pitch attitude of the airplane while it
is still on the ground. The pitch rate defines the initial slope of the dip. For the accident flight, the
dip was about 120 feet, indicating a pitch attitude of about 14° while the airplane was very close to
the ground.</div>

                        <div class="chunk-text">[CONCLUSIONS] In
both incidents, the following signs of the impending stall clearly existed :
a) 
Continuous drag increase and correlative speed loss at constant engine
power,
b) Abnormal
c) 
G-break,
autopilot activity in roll prior to the disconnection,
d) Stall warning. In both incidents, the flight crews readily recovered from the stall. None of
them reported either abnormal or excessive aileron wheel forces during the
recovery. The existence of icing conditions outside the JAR/FAR icing
envelope was indirectly shown by computing the drag build-up from the
DFDR data traces and by comparing it with the certification criteria
envelope. The effects of the ice pollution were clearly shown to be beyond
what had been taken into account in certification. Still, the stalls occurred
at angles of attack consistent with the icing stall warning threshold. The “ice-induced aileron hinge moment reversal” phenomenon, which was
discovered in the post-Roselawn accident investigation and testing, was not
involved in the Air Mauritius and in the Ryanair incidents. Based upon the foregoing.
neither of these incidents 
 to ATR an
icing scenario of the type of that was discovered during the p ost-Roselawn
accident investigation
224

Since the failure of the flight crew to observe the minimum Np setting
(86 %) 
 in icing conditions was a common fact in both cases, at 
DGAC
request, ATR rightly investigated the effects of the lower than required Np
setting (77 % ) associated with severe icing conditions. ATR’s tests and
research involved both theoretical studies and flight testing. The results
were presented to the DGAC and to the BEA. ATR showed that the
combined effects of Np setting at 77% and of severe icing conditions were
likely to cause unusual ice accretions on the propeller blades, which in turn
could generate an highly turbulent airflow over the wing airfoil. Since an
increased level of turbulence is known to cause the deposit of a rough, thin
layer of ice over the entire airfoil, especially in severe icing environments,
this mechanism was believed to be the origin of the abnormal drag build-up
observed prior to the Air Mauritius and RyanAir incidents and of the stall at
or about the icing stall warning threshold. As a consequence, ATR took actions to re-emphasize the already existing
limitations regarding the minimum Np setting in icing conditions. The
aircraft check list was in particular amended for that purpose. The BEA, the DGAC, and ATR still believe that the mechanism described
above could contribute to the alteration of aircraft performance in severe
icing environments.</div>

in violation of the ATR-72 AFM/AOM. In this regard, the Simmons Airlines
Winter Operations Handout also specifically provides :

Crews are cautioned to remain alert to these conditions and
frequently check Static Air Temperature (SAT) indications during
cruise and descent. If SAT indications reach a value of 5 degrees C
or less, good operating practice would dictate that icing equipment
be operated accordingly. Further, while the aircraft was flying the second
hold, from 1532:30 to 1534:30, a large decrease
northern right turn in the
of 14 kts was recorded on
the DFDR. The analysis of this speed reduction indicates that it was caused
by the following : turn technique initially conducted at constant torque with
a high bank angle representing a large contribution to the speed decay;
fluctuating winds with a magnitude of up to 40 kts from the south southwest
(210 degrees); ice accretion resulting from icing conditions with freezing
precipitation confirmed by the BEA study. Although it was impossible to accurately evaluate the different individual
contributions to the large speed decrease, there is no question that part of
this speed decrease was attributable to the ice accretion. The NTSB’s own
analysis indicates a first small drag increase 24 minutes before the roll
upset, at 15.33. Thus, the 1533:56 caution alert chime might have
corresponded to the aircraft’s ice detector system (AAS), which would have
responded within 30 seconds after the first ice accretion began. This view
is supported by the fact that during the Edwards AFB flight tests, the AAS
system activated the aural icing warning within 30 seconds of encountering
the artificial freezing precipitation conditions. Significantly.
the 1533:56
caution alert chime was never acknowledged by the flight crew according to
both the CVR and the DFDR data.
193

At 1541:07, a “single tone similar to caution alert chime” sounds. The DFDR
data indicates that the flight crew then activated the airframe de-icing
system, Two seconds later at 1541:09, the flight crew increased NP from
NP 77% to NP 8 6 % . This DFDR data is confirmed by the increased noise
which can be heard on the CVR tape. AT 1542:02, the CVR transcript records “8 clicks” which could have
corresponded with the activation of the following anti-icing systems:
pushbuttons for Engine 1 and 2, Propeller 1 and 2, Horn 1 and 2, Side
Window, and the engine continuous relight knob. However, during the
BEA’s investigation, the BEA had the opportunity to participate in two test
flights during which the BEA listened and recorded on the CVRs various
sounds generated in the cockpit. No clicks were audible on the CVR. Moreover the activation of two push-buttons of the airframe de-icing system
is not audible on Flight 4184’s CVR.</div>

                        <div class="chunk-text">[CONCLUSIONS] However, the stall nevertheless
occurred at the icing stall warning threshold and a massive drag build up
and the correlative airspeed loss should have triggered the crew’s attention. Such severe drag increases were felt to be alwavs associated with these
unusual ice accretions, as all incidents had indicated, including this one. Also, recovery actions were readily accomplished by the flight crew, and
aileron effectiveness and control wheel forces were not reported to be
abnormal.
228

Nevertheless, because the ATR-72 had no in-service history of any such roll
control icing related events and was certified using different and modified
icing codes from those used for the certification of the ATR-42, the DGAC
required that ATR re-visit the determination of ice accretions within the
Appendix C envelope,
under the modified codes, for the ATR-42. This
research was on-going at the time of the Roselawn accident.

2.3.5. CONCLUSION
Until the post-Roselawn tests and research, the freezing drizzle/freezing
rain conditions were not perceived by the worldwide industry as a major
threat to the safe operation of regional airline aircraft. These conditions
were, and still are, omitted from the certification criteria. Although such
conditions were generally understood to be hazardous and to be avoided,
there was no absolute prohibition to fly into such conditions, based upon the
assumptions that they were rare occurrences which could be recognized
and avoided and that properly certificated aircraft would safely cope with
short inadvertent encounters. Neither regulatory environment nor the available means of experimental
research did encourage the Western manufacturers and Airworthiness
Authorities to focus on the characteristics of such conditions and on their
potential effects on the aircraft performance and controllability, but rather,
to re-emphasize good operational practices to avoid such conditions as ATR
has emphasized, and in particular, re-emphasized following the Mosinee
incident. The BEA notes that among of the ATR 42 incidents, which all occurred in
the clean, flaps 0°, configuration, and which all involved failure to follow
icing conditions procedures none,
exhibited the unique characteristics
involved in the Roselawn accident, namely an outer wing airfoil flow
separation at an AOA well below the icing stall warning threshold, without
any prior noticeable drag build-up and without any significant asymmetrical
lift loss.
230

Aileron hinge moment modifications could only be noted in two of these
incidents - it is still doubtful that they existed in the Newark incident - and
their contribution was perceived bv all investigating
parties as a marginal
characteristic of what was substantially concluded as an asymmetrical stall
in severe icing conditions. There was no evidence that such modifications of
the aileron hinge moment could become a predominant factor in different
circumstances, since they had not initiated roll excursions or interfered
with crew recovery actions in any of the incidents. It is furthermore today understood that the prior ATR 42 incidents and the
ATR 72 Roselawn accident involved different mechanisms and amplitudes of
airflow separations.</div>

affected the conspicuity of the ice accumulation, making it difficult to perceive the ice
accumulation during the icing exposure periods. NASA-Lewis’s scientists described the IRT ice
accretions as mostly “glaze” ice, like mixed or clear ice in nature, although it looked slightly like
rime ice when the IRT was brightly lighted for photographic documentation of the ice accretions
because of its roughness. The Safety Board notes that it is possible that such an accumulation
would be difficult for pilots to perceive visually during flight, particularly in low light conditions. This type of accumulation would be consistent with the accident airplane’s CVR, which did not
 
173 Although the Safety Board considered other possible sources for the aerodynamic degradation
(such as a mechanical malfunction), the physical evidence did not support a system or structural failure, and the
FDR data indicated a gradual, steadily increasing performance degradation that was consistent with degradation
observed by the Safety Board in data from events in which icing was a known factor.
174 All pilot reports indicated moderate or less ice accretions, except the pilots of NW flight 272,
who reported that they encountered a trace of rime ice during the descent, then encountered moderate-to-severe
icing at 4,000 feet msl about 2 minutes after the accident.

record any crew discussion of perceived ice accumulation and/or the need to activate deicing
boots during the last 5 minutes of the accident flight. The location of rough ice coverage observed during the icing tunnel tests varied,
depending on AOA; at lower AOAs, the ice accretions extended farther aft on the upper wing
surface (to the aft edge of the deicing boot on the upper wing surface, about 7 percent of the wing
chord at the aileron midspan), whereas at higher AOAs, the ice accretions extended farther aft on
the lower wing surface. In some IRT test conditions, sparse feather-type ice accretion extended
aft of the deicing boot coverage on the lower wing surface (which extends to about 10½ percent
of the airfoil chord at the aileron midspan) as far as 30 to 35 percent of the airfoil’s chord.176
The density of the rough ice coverage also varied, depending on the exposure
time; a sparse layer of rough ice usually accreted on the entire impingement area during the first
30 seconds to 1 minute of exposure, and the layer became thicker and more dense as exposure
time increased.</div>

obtained during research conducted by the FAA at the University of Illinois at
Urbana/Champaign (UIUC).
The Safety Board’s study of the accident airplane’s aerodynamic performance
indicated that it began to degrade from ice accumulation173 about 4½ to 5 minutes before the
autopilot disengaged, as the airplane descended through 7,000 feet msl; the amount of
degradation increased gradually as the airplane descended to 4,000 feet msl. (See section
1.16.1.2.) Based on this gradual performance degradation, weather radar data that showed light
precipitation intensities, pilot reports of moderate or less ice accretions,174 and the Safety Board
and NCAR weather studies, it appeared likely that Comair flight 3272 encountered icing
conditions that fell within the Part 25 appendix C envelope (see section 1.6.1) and/or the lower
portion of the SLD icing range during its descent to 4,000 feet msl. Thus, the postaccident icing
tunnel tests were performed using LWCs between 0.52 and 0.85 grams per cubic meter and
water droplet sizes between 20 microns and 270 microns. Total air temperatures (TAT) used in
the icing tunnel tests ranged between 26o F and 31o F (-3o C and -0.5o C),175 consistent with the
static air temperature (SAT) values recorded by the FDR during the airplane’s descent from
7,000 to 4,000 feet msl. The exposure time used in the icing tunnel tests was 5 minutes;
additional runs were conducted under some test conditions to determine the effect that deicing
boot activation had on cleaning the leading edge and on subsequent ice accretions. The icing tunnel tests did not result in thick ice accumulation under any test
condition (including SLD droplets); rather, the tests consistently resulted in a thin (0.25 inch
accumulation or less), rough “sandpaper-type” ice coverage over a large portion of the airfoil’s
leading edge deicing boot surface area (and aft of the deicing boot on the lower wing surface in
some test conditions). In addition, in many IRT test conditions, small (½ inch) ice ridges
accreted along the leading edge deicing boot seams. (The effects of these ridges will be
discussed later in this section.) According to NASA and Safety Board IRT test observers, the
thin, rough ice coverages (and ice ridges, where applicable) that accreted on the EMB-120 wing
were somewhat translucent and were often difficult to perceive from the observation window.</div>

                        <div class="chunk-text">[CONCLUSIONS &gt; FINDINGS] The guidance provided by Comair in its memos, bulletins, manuals, and
training program did not adequately communicate or emphasize specific
minimum airspeeds for operating the EMB-120 in the flaps-up
configuration, in or out of icing conditions, and thus contributed to the
accident.
18. The pilots likely did not recognize the need to abide by special restrictions
on airspeeds that were established for icing conditions because they did not
perceive the significance (or presence) of Comair flight 3272’s ice
accumulation.
19. Whether the pilots perceived ice accumulating on the airplane or not, they
should have recognized that operating in icing conditions at the air traffic
control-assigned airspeed of 150 knots with flaps retracted could result in an
unsafe flight situation; therefore, their acceptance of the 150-knot airspeed
assignment in icing conditions without extending flaps contributed to the
accident.
20. Minimum airspeed information for various flap configurations and phases
and conditions of flight would be helpful to pilots of all passenger-carrying
airplanes.
21. The stall warning system installed in the accident airplane did not provide
an adequate warning to the pilots because ice contamination was present on
the airplane’s airfoils, and the system was not designed to account for
aerodynamic degradation or adjust its warning to compensate for the
reduced stall warning margin caused by the ice.
22. The accident airplane’s autopilot was capable of normal operation and
appeared to be operating normally during the last minutes of the accident
flight, and the autopilot disconnect and warning systems operated in a
manner consistent with their design logic.
23. Had the pilots been flying the airplane manually (without the autopilot
engaged) they likely would have noted the increased right-wing-down
control wheel force needed to maintain the desired left bank, become aware
of the airplane’s altered performance characteristics, and increased their

179
airspeed or otherwise altered their flight situation to avoid the loss of
control.
24. Disengagement of the autopilot during all operations in icing conditions is
necessary to enable pilots to sense the aerodynamic effects of icing and
enhance their ability to retain control of the airplane.
25. If the pilots of Comair flight 3272 had received a ground proximity warning
system, autopilot, or other system-generated cockpit warning when the
airplane first exceeded the autopilot’s maximum bank command limits with
the autopilot activated, they might have been able to avoid the unusual
attitude condition that resulted from the autopilot’s sudden disengagement.
26. Despite the accumulated lessons of several major accidents and (in the case
of the EMB-120) the specific findings of a staff engineer, the Federal
Aviation Administration failed to adopt a systematic and proactive (rather
than incremental and reactive) approach to the certification and operational
issues of turbopropeller-driven transport airplane icing, which was causal to
this accident.
27. The icing certification process has been inadequate because it has not
required manufacturers to demonstrate the airplane’s flight handling and
stall characteristics under a sufficiently realistic range of adverse ice
accretion/flight handling conditions.

and balance form, they read it erroneously, or they were not thoroughly
knowledgeable of the power requitements of this aircraft, Although
the crew had satisfactorily completed the prescribed training in this
model aircraft, their actions on this flight did not demonstrate a
thorough knowledge of the thrust requirements or of the use of the
anti-ice systems, While {{t cannot be substantiated that the use of
el power would have prevented this accident, the increased acceleration would have increased the probability of a successful takeoff,

Although tower personnel, a number of passengers, and ground
witnesses thought that the takeoff acceleration of this aircraft was
slow, 4 comparison of the acceleration, as determined from the flight
data recorder with the computed expected acceleration, disclosed that
the acceleration was very near the computed expected acceleration for
the power setting selected, The setting actually used by the crew
for this takeoff, while not in accordance with performance requirements, was adequate to permit a successful takeoff on Runway 35,
with clean airfoils, The increased power required for the existing
gross weight is stipulated to meet the single-engine climb requirements in the event of an engine failure following takeoff.

positive rate of climb was noted prior to theloss of control, The
review of the flight data recorder readout indicated that lift-off
occurred at near the computed perfor.sance lift-off speed. This
might seem to question the influence of the aerodynamic effect of I
the ice adhering to the airfoils of the aircraft during this takeoff,

» 27 «

However, studies have confirmed that the increased lift obtained
frou ground effect may permit an aircraft with iced airfoils to
become airborne and subsequently be unable to maintain fiight when
entering the area of reduced Lift leaving ground effect,

The accurate weight, size,and shape of the ice adhering to
this aircraft at the time loss of control was experienced could
not be determined; therefore, the extent of aerodynamic penalties
resulting from this {{ce accumulation could not be determined. Also,
determination of the aerodynamic effect of ice on 4 specific airfoil is not a requirement in the certification of the aircraft. Even if this were a requirement, it would be virtually impossible
to determine the aerodynamic penalties of the various shapes and
textures of ice that may be accumulated in flight.</div>

explained that as the ice did not cause hia any problem on approach
and landing, he did not expect it to give him a probles on takeoff.

_ He further stated that during his previous flying career in Douglas
DC-3, Martin 404, and Fairchild F-27 atreraft, he had at tines mad:
takeoffs with ice adhering to the airfoils, following an approach
and landing with the ice, in which no difficulty was experienced,

The Board further concludes that under the circumstancea, the
aircraft should have been detced before takeoff, Studies, actual
experience, training, and the regulations have long emphasized the
aerodynamic penalties of takeoff with ice adhering to the airfoils,

« 26 -

NASA studies have determined that the magnitude of the aerodynamic
penalties resulting from an iced airfoil were primarily a function

of the shape and size of the ice formation near the leading edge

of the airfoil, These studies also showed that rotation of an iced
airfoil to angles of attack, other than that at which icing occurred,
caused sufficiently large changes in the pitchitng-moment coefficient
that, in flight, rapid corrections in trim might be required in

order to avoid a hazardous situation. This would seem to be confirmed
by the two training incidents in which unexpected violent rolls and
delayed recovery were experfenced during approach to stalls with
known or suspected airfoil ice,

Although the takeoff gross weight of the aircraft required the
use of -l power (14,000 pounds of thrust per engine), and this power
requirement was clearly identified on the completed wefght and balance
form given to the crew by the station agent,the crew selected &lt;5
power (12,250 pounds of thrust per engine) for this takeoff, No
explanation was offered by the crew for this power selection other
than that they failed to recognize the gross weight power requirement.</div>

started the aurcratt&#x27;s horizontal surfaces were at least partially

covered with wet snow. Although after the engines were started, sone of
the snow exposed to the propellers’ slipstreams was probably blown from

the inboard surfaces of the wing, snow continued to adhere to sections

of the wings outboard of the propeller radius. Moreover, because of the
below-freezing ambient temperature and the further reduction in temperature
caused by lowered pressure as the air moved over the top surfaces of the
wings, the snow froze to the wing surfaces. Conventional aircraft are generally designed so that the wings
will begin to stall at the root section first. This permits the ailerons,
which are outboard on the wings, to remain effective at high angles of
attack and provides favorable stall warning characteristics from the
buffet on the empennage. 7/ The No-d 262&#x27;s design is not unusual in
this respect, and stall tests show that the aircraft has good lateral
control authority throughout entry to a stall and through the initia!
stager of a stall. The Safety Boarc concludes that because of the snow that had
adhered to the outboard surfaces of the wings of Flight 561, the normal
stall characteristics of the wings were reversed. Consequently. the
ailerons became at least partially ineffective before the wings lost
enough lift to prevent the aircraft from ciainting.

Tee, snow, or frost adheres to an aircraft&#x27;s wings, control
surfaces, and stabilizing surfaces and can cause control problems; */
because of such problems, 14 CFR 91.209 prohibits takeoffs in an airplane
&quot;,..that has...snow or ice adhering to the wings, or stabilizing or
control surfaces...or...any frost adhering to the wings, or stabilizing

or control surfaces, uniess the frost has been polished to make it
smooth.”

According to a recent review ®/ of the effects of wing surface
roughness, frost, snow, or freezing fog adhering to wing surfaces causes
a reduction in maximum lift coefficient, a reduction in the angle of
attack at which stall occurs, and rapid post stall increases in drag. The above effects are most pronounced when the roughness is on or near
the leading edge of the wing. Fer example, for a given particle size of
uniform roughness, the maximum lift coefficient fs reduced: (1) 35
percent if the roughness 1s located within the first 2 percent of the
wing chord, (2) 15 percent if the roughness is 1) cated aft of the firsc
10 percent of the wing chord, and (3) about 8 percent if the roughness
is located aft of the first 30 percent of the wing chord. In this accident, evidence indicates conclusively that ‘the
aircraft&#x27;s wings and horizontal stabilizer, including the delcer boots,
were partially covered by wet snow or frozen stiow when the takeoff roll
began. Both the station agent and a local pilot recalled that the
aircraft was taxied from the parking ramp with snow on the aircraft&#x27;s
wings and horizontal stabilizer. Also, after the engines were started,
the station agent saw some of the snow blowing from the aircraft but
recalled that some snow remained on the wings and horizontal stabilizer. Additionally, the photographs taken about 45 min after the accident
clearly show frozen snow adhering to a substantial portion of the top
surface of the left horizontal stabilizer. Sirce this surfacr. came to

vacuum-operated deicing boots on the leading edges of the airfoils would
be able to remove only that ice immediately adjacent to and on the boot,
leaving a large area of the airfoils subject to ice accretion, This la.ter
ice could only be removed by operating the aircraft in an area where
the ambient temperature would melt the ice. In view of che abovo, the Safety Board concludes that the most
likely reason for the inability to climb to a higher altitude was an
accretion of ice which increased the aircraft&#x27;s gross weight and decreased thw lifting efficiency of the airfoils,

The pilot, accompanied by his wife and five children, was
returning to his hoine in Michigan, He received a personal weather
brieting it the flight service station at Savannah. Although no record
of the contents of the briefing was made, routine briefings normally
include information from the current surface weather chart, terminal
sequence reports, SIGMETS and AIRMETS, radar summary reports,
and winds aloft reports--all of these data were available to the briefer
and to the pilot. From the weather information that was available to the pilot,
he should have known that moderate-to.-severe icing was forecasted
for part of his intended route. In addition, he should have known that
the owner&#x27;s manual advised pilots tc avoid known icing conditions when -
ever possible. The pilot&#x27;s radio communicctions through various stages uf
‘the flight indicated that he was concerned about the avoidance of
thunderstorm3, about icing conditions, about the erratic operation of
one of the engines, and about his occasional inability to receive VOR
stations. Nevertneless, the pilot continued on his preplanned flight
and at 1911:20, following a series of radio communicetions with ATC
about icing, about the aircraft&#x27;s climb performance, anc about vibrations,
he requested ATC assistance to get to an airport. The controller recognized the need for assistance and began to
collect airport end weather information to provide priority service to
the distressed pilot. Although the pilot did not, on this occasion, declare an emergency, the controllers treated the situation as an emergency and initiated actions to orovide priority hanaling for the flight. The controller did not, nor was he required to, notify the pilot that
the flight was receiving priority handling. Possibly, had the controller
told the pilot that he was considered to be an emergency and had ne requested specifically the pilot&#x27;s desire, the pilot might have been able
to participate more actively in planning a course of action. The controller interpreted the pilot&#x27;s transmission at 1911:35

The first officer called Vp L1 knots early, and the captain rotated
about 5 knots early. His rotation rate was about 2.5 degrees per
second. The airplane accelerated normally during the takeoff roll. After
liftoff and before transitioning to the initial climb, the wing
stalled before the stall warning system activated. Lateral instability was caused by an irregular stall progression
across the wing that led to an abrupt left roll and wing tip strike
that further reduced the ability to climb. The airplane experienced a wing lift deficiency because of ice
contamination. The initiation of rotation for takeoff at a speed about 5 knots
below the prescribed speed resulted in a higher peak AOA at
liftoff and, with the wing contamination, eliminated any AOA
stall margin that might have existed with a normal rotation. According to wind tunnel studies conducted by the
manufacturer, a wing upper surface roughness consisting of
particles only 1-2 mm diameter (0.04-0.08 inch), at a density of
about one particle per square centimeter, can cause lift losses on
the F-28 wing of about 22 and 33 percent, in ground effect and
free air, respectively. The first officer observed the wing from the cockpit and stated
that he checked the black strip for ice accumulation. The black
strip was intended to aid in detection of in-flight leading edge ice
and, because of its location on the leading edge, is not effective
for detecting upper surface ice. At night, flightcrews cannot visually detect minute amounts of
ice on the part of the wing that is visible from the cockpit
windows. This part of the wing is 30 to 40 feet from the
cockpit. Flightcrews also may not be able to detect such
contamination from the cabin windows.

76

Runway 13/3! was not significantly contaminated, and runway
conditions were properly reported at LaGuardia on the night of
the accident. Accident history shows that nonstatted, turbojet, transportcategory airplanes have been involved in a disproportionate
number of takeoff accidents where undetected upper wing ice
contamination has been cited as the probable cause or sole
contributing factor. No specific injury pattern could be identified in the cabin to
explain why some passengers survived the accident and others
did not. Passengers who sustained minor injuries and injuries that were
not life threatening most likely drowned as a result of confuston,
disorientation or entrapment or a combination of these factors. At the time of the accident, procedures for opening emergency
door exits were inaccurately and incompletely displayed on
USAir&#x27;s F-28 passenger safety briefing cards, but they did not
contribute to the fatalities in the accident. The locations of the dike, pump house, and ILS localizer ground
plane antenna were within current FAA guidelines; however, the
locations did not meet [CAO Annex 14 criteria.</div>

on the windshield, which appeared to be snow, would be consistent with some
amount of ice accretion. The Safety Board believes that an accretion of ice on the wing is the only
reasonable explanation for the occurrence of stick shaker activation and loss of roll
control at higher-than-expected airspeeds. The Safety Board believes that only a
small amount of ice on the wing’s leading edge could have had a significant effect
on the aerodynamic performance under the circumstances of this flight. If the
airplane accumulated ice during the climb above 11,500 feet while at a relatively
low angle of attack, the ice would have formed at the stagnation point® associated
with that angle of attack. As the airplane slowed, the corresponding inorease in
angle of attack would have resulted in a movement of the stagnation point lower
on the leading edge. Thus, the ice that had formed at the higher speed would be
above the new stagnation point and produce a greater disruption of the air flow
over the wing upper surface leading to premature boundary layer’ separation. The
result would be a progressive reduction in the lift produced by the wing and a stall
at a lower angle of attack. In past aviation accident investigations, the Safety
Board has determined that almost imperceptible amounts of ice, 1/4 of an inch or
less, on the wing leading edge has significantly increased the stall speed and lateral
control capability of the airplane. Thus, the Safety Board believes that ice accumulated during the climb and
resulted in a stall at higher-than-normal speed. While it is likely that the accretion
of ice alone would not have led to a stall had the captain attempted to maintain a

The stagnation point is the point on the leading edge of the airfoil where the relative
airflow diverges to pass above and below the wing so that the local airflow velocity is zero.

target airspeed instead of a target pitch attitude, the Safety Board cites the captain’s
inattention to ice accretion as a factor in the accident. Propeller Failure

Evaluation of the FDR, FDAU, and CVR data revealed that operation of the
engines and propellers was normal until after the loss of control occurred. This
information corresponded with the crew’s statements. Evidence obtained after the
accident from the left engine indicated that at some point the engine had been
operated under extremely high vibratory loads at low engine speeds. The FDR
revealed that the right engine and propeller continued to operate within normal
parameters until the collision with the terrain as the airplane departed the runway
during the landing. The Safety Board considered and could not conclusively discard the
possibility that the nacelle damage was caused by the maneuvering and air loads
imposed on the structure during the out-of-control descent. If this were the case,
the distortion of the nacelle and engine mounts could have moved the propeller
control linkage to feather, which in turn would have resulted in a less of blade
centrifugal loads, which permitted the blades to separate.</div>

whether the snow was adhering to the wing
surface cither by brushing it by hand to test its
characteristics prior to boarding, or by close
observation during the taxi run.

o

It is well known that an airfoil even partially
covered with ice, frost, or snow no longer retains
the aerodynamic characteristics of a clean airfoil
and that the precise characteristic of the affected airfoil are somewhat unpredictable. NACA studies have confirmed that the adherence of even a light layer of ice or frost ona
wing surface does, in fact, adversely affect the
laminar flow over the wing and, thereby, results
in higher stall speeds and lower stail angles of
attack. The characteristics of snow adhering to
an airfoil may be even more detrimental in that
it could present a rougher surface texture than
would normally be expected of frost or ice. The weight, shape, and texture of the snow
adhering to the wing could not be determined
and, therefore, the extent of the aerodynamic
penalties resulting from this accumulation could
not be accurately assessed.

[t was confirmed that lift-off occurred and a
momentary rate of climb was established prior
to the loss of control, which might seem to
contradict the extent of the aerodynamic penalties resulting from the snow-covered airfoil
during this takeoff. However, studies have indicated that the increased lift obtained from
ground effect may permit an aircraft with an ice
or snow-covered airfoil to become airborne and
then subsequently be unable to maintain flight
when entering the area of reduced lift upon
leaving ground effect conditions. The insidious
nature of this loss of control in the takeoff
regime makes recognition and assessment of the
situation difficult, inasmuch as contro! may be
regained as the aircraft reenters the area of
ground effect. Thus, considering the facts of the accident, it
is concluded by the Board that substantial
penalties were imposed on the aerodynamic
characteristics of the aircraft due to the snowcovered airfoil. These penalties, while not precluding the aircraft from becoming airborne and
bricfly establishing a rate of climb while in
ground effect, resulted in a stall as the aircraft
climbed out of the ground effect. This accident v.&lt;5 a clear demonstration of
this phenomenon which, when it became evident

J

to the pilot that control could not be maintained, left discontinuance of the takeoff as the
only alternative.

[t is obvious that under the circumstances, the
aircraft should have been deiced prior to takeoff. Studies, actual experience, training, and the
FAR’s have long emphasized the hazards of
takeoff with ice, snow, or frost adhering to the
airfoils. Why the captain elected not to have the
airctaft deiced, other than that he did not think
it was needed, is difficult to explain. Good pilot
judgment and sound operating procedures would
have shown the advisability of airfoil deicing
under the existing conditions. Notwithstanding the matter of judgment on
the part of the pilot in attempting to take off
under these conditions, the Safety Board also
takes a critical view of the company’s management policies with respect to the operational
dispatching functions.</div>

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] At the Safety Board’s public
hearing on this accident, a representative from McDonnell-Douglas stated that small amounts of
upper wing ice may severely degrade the lifting capability of the wing and lead to loss of roll and
pitch control on DC-9-10 series airplanes. He concluded that the DC-9-10 series and other airplanes,
with and without leading edge slats, would be affected to varying degrees by small amounts of
upper wing ice contamination. For example, granular ice of only 0.030 inch (similar to the roughness
of 30-40 grit sandpaper) would degrade. the maximum lifting capability of the DC-9 wing by about
20 percent. For a given increase in angle of attack, an ice contaminated wing would have a lesser
increase of lift than would an ice-free wing. The stall speed would increase and the stall angle of
attack would decrease, possibly to the point that the stall warning indicator (receiving its signals
from angle of attack sensors, not airspeed sensors) would not activate before stall. Indeed, in the
case of flight 1713, no stick shaker was heard on the CVR tape, although the airplane was in the stall
regime before impact. In addition, if less than normal lift is available during the takeoff pitch
rotation, the airplane may not be able-to leave the ground either when expected or in a stable
manner. In any case, the stall safety margin is significantly reduced. ,

Ice contamination also may produce roll oscillations and unexpected pitch-up tendencies
during flight. Ice accumulations usually are not uniform and result in nonuniform lift degradations
on the wings, horizontal tail, and, to a small degree, the fuselage. For example, a small section of ice
on an otherwise contaminant-free wing or a small section of rougher ice on a contaminated wing,
may be the first area on the wing to stall or produce less than normal lift. This uneven lift may result
in the onset of roll, followed by pilot initiated counter ailreon and spoiler deflections which can
quickly set up roll oscillations. On swept wing airplanes, contaminated outboard wing areas also can
produce unexpected pitch-up tendencies because the outboard wing areas are usually behind the
center of gravity of the airplane. When the wingtips stall; the inboard parts of the wings (ahead of .
the center of gravity) produce proportionally more lift and the nose pitches up. However, the

35

greater than normal pitch rate on flight 1713 was present during initial rotation (when the wings
were unloaded) indicating that the high pitch rate was pilot-induced. Ice-induced pitch rates, on the
other hand, result from loaded wings that just reach the localized stall angle of attack. The Safety
Board is not aware of any service history or pilot reports describing DC-9-10 series ice-induced pitchup tendencies. The small amount of ice on the wings of the airplane contributed to significant controllability
problems on flight 1713. Safety Board calculations show that a stall could have occurred on the
accident airplane at 165 knots calibrated airspeed with 1.4 Gs on the airframe if there: had been
about a 20 percent reduction in maximum lifting capability.</div>

enough to affect a DC-9 to some unknown degree, from a lateral distance of 1,600 feet. This could
have occured if, and only if, all the other conditions previously cited for potential encounter were
present. ,

However, the Safety Board wishes to emphasize that it has not eliminated the possibility that
on a different day with different conditions and different aircraft, a potential problem might exist
concerning wingtip vortices: Therefore, the Board believes that the FAA should commence a
research project to acquire data from dedicated sensors to determine what consideration, if any,
should be given to wake vortices in a parallel offset runway situation.

2.5 Airplane Deicing and Subsequent Contamination

The Safety Board believes that the airplane was adequately deiced before it departed the deice
pad. Evidence suggests that the combination system of fixed deicing snorkels and mobile deicing
trucks used by Continental at Denver is quicker and more efficient than the use of deicing trucks
alone. Nevertheless, since the airplane was exposed to a moderate snowstorm in subfreezing
conditions for approximately 27 minutes following deicing, the Safety Board believes that portions
of the airframe became contaminated with a thin, rough layer of ice. The pilot of Continental flight
875 stated that he did not see any contamination on the wings of flight 1713. However, several
surviving passengers on flight 1713 reported seeing some “ice” on engine inlets or in “patches” on
the wing after deicing. These accounts suggest isolated fragments of contamination. During precipitation in subfreezing ambient temperatures, ice can accumulate on airframe
surfaces after a thorough deicing when the deicing solution evaporates, runs off, or is diluted with
the precipitation. All three of these conditions occurred on the wings of flight 1713, with dilution of I
the deicing solution having been the predominant condition. Due to many variables involved, the
Safety Board found it impossible to determine exactly where or exactly how much ice had formed on
the wing and empennage surfaces of flight 1713. The Safety Board believes that enough wet snow
(0.29 inch) fell on flight 1713 during the 27 minutes between deicing and takeoff to dilute the
deicing fluid to the point where ice began to reform. This 0.29 inch of snow, if melted, would equate
to about 0.032 inch of water. The accumulated precipitation on the upper horizontal surfaces of the airplane probably would
have been a combination of snow and melting snow or slush. Consequently, because of the dilution
of the anti-icing fluid, the actual thickness of the slush probably would have been slightly greater
than the water equivalent of the snow alone and would have frozen into a roughened surface.</div>

recordings from accidents with no wing contamination. These surges occurred when the intakes:
were no longer aligned with the relative wind during dynamic maneuvering of the airplane, causing
compressor blades to stall and subsequent surges. In all instances, the surges were the effect rather
than the cause. Consequently, engine compressor surges were not a causal factor in this accident. The lack of leading edge devices on the wings of the DC-9 airplane make it more vulnerable to
performance degradation due to wing contamination; however, the Safety Board believes that the
FAA and McDonnell-Douglas have adequately warned DC-9-10 series operators of such possible
degraded flight characteristics through AC 20-117 and several articles on airframe contamination in
McDonnell-Douglas publications.7 In general, McDonnel!-Douglas provided guidance for carefully
inspecting for “almost undetectable amounts of ice,&quot; and the FAA regulations require that airfoil

surfaces be free of contamination” before takeoff, which is adequately specific information for
operators. Finally, airplane certification requirements for performance are based on airfoil surfaces
that are not contaminated by ice, snow, or frost. The Safety Board has investigated three previous DC-9-10 series icing-related accidents which
were similar-to the circumstances of the accident involving flight 1713.8 In two of the accidents, ice
was visible to the crews before takeoff; in the other accident, the crew failed to examine the wings
before takeoff. The Safety Board believes that the November 15, 1987, accident again demonstrates
that even small amounts of contamination on the upper surfaces of an airplane can seriously
degrade lift. This accident underscores the critical importance for the pilot-in-command to ensure
the surfaces are clean before every takeoff when in conditions conducive to contamination. The
crew of flight 1713 also failed to examine the wings for contamination before takeoff. Therefore,
the Safety Board believes that there is no justification for questioning the FAA certification of a
DC-9-10 series airplane.

2.8 The First Officer&#x27;s Actions During Rotation

The first officer&#x27;s poor rotation technique probably contributed to the loss of airplane control. Evidence of trouble during the takeoff rotation was apparent from data recovered from the FDR. The altitude dip associated with pitch rotation in a DC-9-14 airpiane is normally about 50 to 60 feet

below field elevation, consistent with a pitch angle of about 6° during liftoff. Under normal .

circumstances, the magnitude of the dip is porportional to the pitch attitude of the airplane while it
is still on the ground. The pitch rate defines the initial slope of the dip. For the accident flight, the
dip was about 120 feet, indicating a pitch attitude of about 14° while the airplane was very close to
the ground.</div>

Tee, snow, or frost adheres to an aircraft&#x27;s wings, control
surfaces, and stabilizing surfaces and can cause control problems; */
because of such problems, 14 CFR 91.209 prohibits takeoffs in an airplane
&quot;,..that has...snow or ice adhering to the wings, or stabilizing or
control surfaces...or...any frost adhering to the wings, or stabilizing

or control surfaces, uniess the frost has been polished to make it
smooth.”

According to a recent review ®/ of the effects of wing surface
roughness, frost, snow, or freezing fog adhering to wing surfaces causes
a reduction in maximum lift coefficient, a reduction in the angle of
attack at which stall occurs, and rapid post stall increases in drag. The above effects are most pronounced when the roughness is on or near
the leading edge of the wing. Fer example, for a given particle size of
uniform roughness, the maximum lift coefficient fs reduced: (1) 35
percent if the roughness 1s located within the first 2 percent of the
wing chord, (2) 15 percent if the roughness is 1) cated aft of the firsc
10 percent of the wing chord, and (3) about 8 percent if the roughness
is located aft of the first 30 percent of the wing chord. In this accident, evidence indicates conclusively that ‘the
aircraft&#x27;s wings and horizontal stabilizer, including the delcer boots,
were partially covered by wet snow or frozen stiow when the takeoff roll
began. Both the station agent and a local pilot recalled that the
aircraft was taxied from the parking ramp with snow on the aircraft&#x27;s
wings and horizontal stabilizer. Also, after the engines were started,
the station agent saw some of the snow blowing from the aircraft but
recalled that some snow remained on the wings and horizontal stabilizer. Additionally, the photographs taken about 45 min after the accident
clearly show frozen snow adhering to a substantial portion of the top
surface of the left horizontal stabilizer. Sirce this surfacr. came to

started the aurcratt&#x27;s horizontal surfaces were at least partially

covered with wet snow. Although after the engines were started, sone of
the snow exposed to the propellers’ slipstreams was probably blown from

the inboard surfaces of the wing, snow continued to adhere to sections

of the wings outboard of the propeller radius. Moreover, because of the
below-freezing ambient temperature and the further reduction in temperature
caused by lowered pressure as the air moved over the top surfaces of the
wings, the snow froze to the wing surfaces. Conventional aircraft are generally designed so that the wings
will begin to stall at the root section first. This permits the ailerons,
which are outboard on the wings, to remain effective at high angles of
attack and provides favorable stall warning characteristics from the
buffet on the empennage. 7/ The No-d 262&#x27;s design is not unusual in
this respect, and stall tests show that the aircraft has good lateral
control authority throughout entry to a stall and through the initia!
stager of a stall. The Safety Boarc concludes that because of the snow that had
adhered to the outboard surfaces of the wings of Flight 561, the normal
stall characteristics of the wings were reversed. Consequently. the
ailerons became at least partially ineffective before the wings lost
enough lift to prevent the aircraft from ciainting.

the station agent, the captain may have thought that any accumulation of
snow on the wings’ surfaces was either insignificant or would be blown
from the wings while taxiing. In this respect, he might alsu have been
misled by the condition of the deicer boots, which were essentially
clean. In any event, the captain did not take the proper precautions to
insure compliance with company directives and Federal aviation regulations. Consequently, the Safety Board concludes that the captain&#x27;s decision to
take off without insuring that ail snow had been removed from the aircraft&#x27;s

cn wath ND Sea Bl gS BE MTN LS AAI TIER,

The accident again illustrates that in order co insure the
level of safe operaticn desired from a professional pilot, he must
take the proper measures to insure that wings, stabilizing surfaces, and
control surfaces are clean and free of ice, anow, or frost before he
attempts a takeoff. Further, any doubts about the matter must be resolve,
by visual inspectton--if necessary, immediately before the takeoff is
begun. 3. CONCLUSIONS

Finuings

1. The flightc-rew was properly certificated and was
qualified for the flight.

2. The aircraft was aicworthy, and it was certificated and
maintained in accordance with existing regulations and
approved procedures,

There was no evidence of a failure or malfunction of any
of the aircraft&#x27;s structure or systems, including flight
control sytems, flight instrument systems, and powerplants. The aircraft had been deiced 20 to 30 min before takeof*;
however, about 1/4 in. of wet snow had accumulated on the
top of the wings and horizontal stabilizer before the
captain taxied the aircraft for takeoff.

predicted performance vaiur. Shortly after liftoff, the aircraft pecame laterally urStable; it roJ.led to the right, then to the left, back
to the right, and its right wing struck the rursay. The snow adhering to the outboard sections of the wing
probably caused those sections to stall prematurely. The stalling of the outboard sections of the wings
caused a loss of lift and significantly reduced the
effectiveness of the ailerons, which resulted in lateral
control problems and lateral instability. The lateral oscillation of the aircraft further decreased
lite and caused the aircraft to lose altitude and crash. The accident was survivable for the passengers. One passenger was fatally injured because her seatbelt
was net fastened. The accident was marginally survivable for the flightcrew
becaus® the cockpit structure was crushed inward, which
reduced the occupiable space, particularly for the first
officer.</div>

through moderate rime icing during its descent for landing at CLE. Because
the CVR began recording after the airplane landed at CLE, the Safety 8oard
cannot determine if the flightcrew discussed the use of anti-ice protection
during the descent. However, the flightcrew had received ample weather information,
including a PIREP, about icing conditions around CLE during the approach, so
they should have selected both wing and engine icing protection during the
descent for landing. In fact, there is reference on the CVR to use of these
systems while the airplane was on the ground at CLE. The Safety Board
concludes that the flightcrew most likely selected the system &quot;on.&quot; Further,
there was no evidence to suggest that the anti-ice system was inoperative. The Safety Board considered the possibility that the pilots did use
the wing anti-ice system during the descent and that moisture may have run
aft of the heated wing surface and refrozen on the upper wing surface. However, information from the manufacturer indicates that the high
temperatures (350° F or 1779 C) of the heated wing surface would vaporize any
liquid moisture on the wing and that the “runback&quot; was unlikely. Nevertheless, this possibility cannot be ruled out. The Safety Board believes that the most likely possibility of
explaining the formation of ice on the wing surface is that the flightcrew
used the wing anti-ice system during the approach and that the falling dry
snow melted and refroze while the airplane was on the ground at CLE. The
Safety Board believes that this scenario is possible because the wing would
be “hot” upon touchdown (when the air/ground relay deactivates the anti-ice
system automatically) and the blowing dry snow can melt on the wing and
refreeze, as the wing temperature cools to belouw freezing.

2.3 Effect of Ice or Snow Contamination on Airplane Performance

The airplane’s performance profile, which was developed during the
investigation, and witness observations indicate that the takeoff roll and
acceleration were normal wntil the airplane was rotated and lifted off the
ground. The data showed that liftoff occurred at a slightly higher-thannormal airspeed and that the airplane began to climb. However, when reaching
an altitude of 100 feet or less, the airplane rolled steeply.</div>

have become aware of the previous accidents involving wing ice contamination. Then Ryan would have been able to provide the training and guidance to its
flightcrews that should have prevented this accident. Thus, the airline is
also cited as a causal factor in the accident.

50 3.0 CONCLUSIONS 3.1 Findings

J}}. There was no evidence of preexisting airplane structural,
systems, or engine faults that contributed to the loss of
contro) of the airplane 7 seconds after liftoff from runway
23L at Cleveland-Hopkins International Airport.

2. Four previous accidents of DC-9 series 10 airplanes, also
invelving loss of control almost immediately after liftoff,
were attributed to a loss of aerodynamic efficiency due to ice
accumulation on the wings.

3. The accident airplane had flown through conditions conducive
to the accumulation of moderate rime ice during the descent
for landing at Cleveland-Hopkins International Airport, about
40 minutes before the accident, and the flightcrew probably
used the wing anti-ice system during the descent.

4. Ground conditions at the Cleveland-Hopkins International
Airport during the 35-minute turnaround were not conducive to
airframe icing because of the dry snow and the low ambient
temperatures; however, the melting and refreezing of snow on
the previously heated wings could have produced = an

accumulation of ice on the wing upper surface. The flightcrew did not exit the airplane to conduct an
exterior preflight inspection at the Cleveland-Hopkins
International Airport to verify that the wings were free of
ice contamination, and a requirement for such an inspection
was not specified in the Ryan DOC-9 Operations Manual. The first officer was controlling the airplane, and the
takeoff rol] and rotation were normal and accomplished in
accordance with prescribed procedures.

7. The liftoff occurred at a _ higher-than-normal airspeed;
however, the lift-producing efficiency of the wing was
degraded by contamination, and the stall speed margin at

liftoff was minimal. There was some physical evidence but no evidence derived from
the performance analysis to corroborate a tail strike at
takeoff. However, a tail strike could occur with normal pilot
procedures during an attempted takeoff with wing
contamination.

51

The airplane’s wings stalled abruptly and without warning as
the airplane began to climb and the aerodynamic advantage of
ground effect diminished. At the time of stall, the airplane
had sufficient speed to achieve a 1.4 g load factor with
normal aerodynamic characteristics. The engine compressor Surges were caused by the disturbed
airflow aft of the wince and at the engine inlet as the
airplane approached stall. The steep roll concurrent with stall] was caused by the
irregular lift distribution across the wing and was not
controllable by the pilot, thereby preventing recovery. The DC-9 series 10 has no Wing leading edge lift augment ing
devices and is particularly vulnerable to degraded aerodynamic
performance as 2 result of minute amounts of wing
contamination than the later model DC-9 and MO-80 airplanes
that have leading edge devices.</div>

that neither of the flightcrew menbers exited the airplane to conduct a walk
around inspection or a close observation of the wing surface. further, the
Safety Board concludes that the flightcrew did not violate written Ryan
policy on this subject. The flightcrew may have observed the wing leading
edge from the cargo loading door or the cockpit windows. However, in the
existing Jighting condition and from that distance, the detection of a
critical, but minute, amount of ice would have been unlikely if not
impossible. The flightcrew may have been influenced by several factors in their

decision to remain in the airplane. First, they may have believed that the
air *.1as too cold to contain liquid water that could freeze and stick to the
wing surface--the ambient temperature was 23°F and the 14-knot wind was
blowing dry snow off of other objects visible to the crew. Little
information is available regarding the possibility of ice forming during the
melting/cooldown period following the deactivation of wing anti-ice systems
after landing. Second, the Safety Board noted that both crewmembers’
experience prior to flying with Ryan was in OC-9 series 30 aircraft. The
captain flew the C-9 in the U. S. Air Force, and the first officer flew the
DC-9-30 and DC-9-50 at USAir. Because these models have leading edge
devices, they are not as vu,oerable as the OC-9 series 10 airplane to
critical performance degradation “rom small amounts of wing contamination. Therefore, even if the captain or first officer had encountered similar
weather conditions prior to flying with Ryan, they most likely would not have
encountered contro! problems and their concerns about the hazard of wing ice
contamination would probably have been ftessened. Another consideration bearing on the crew’s attention to the
possibility of ice is the lack of de-icing activity by other operators. De-icing equipment had been standing by for approximate&#x27;y 1-1/2 hours and was
immediately available. There was no evidence of fiscal or schedule pressures
by the airline that would have discouraged the crew from using that
equipment. The Safety Board also considered the possibility that fatigue
influenced the pilots’ judgment during the ground operations at CLE and
their decision not to conduct an exterior preflight inspection of the

47

airplane. The flightcrew had flown the same nighttime schedule for 6 days,
including the night of the accident, between BUF and IND with an intermediate
stop each way in CLE. The captain had flown six successive night flights on
the same 8UF-CLE-IND and return route the week before the accident. He had
1 day off between the two periods of duty. The six flights, averaging about
3.8 hours each night, did not exceed FAA maximum flight time limitations;
however, the captain’s schedule hai recently increased from the routine of
flying for 5 days, followed by 9 days off-duty time at home in California. Although his family said that he was accustomed to night flying, the recent
increase in duty and flight time could have induced fatigue.</div>

accretion aft of the deicing boot on the lower wing surface for some of the tested conditions. However, no ice
accretion aft of the deicing boot was noticed during the natural icing certification tests. (See section 2.5.1.)
Although it is possible that some of the drag observed in the accident airplane’s performance was the result of a
sparse, rough ice accumulation aft of the deicing boot on the lower wing surface, it was not possible to positively
determine whether the accident airplane’s ice accretion extended beyond the deicing boot coverage.

stitchlines. During tests conducted at a TAT of 26o F, a small, but prominent (½ inch) ridge of
ice frequently appeared on the forward portion (0.5 to 1 percent MAC) of the leading edge
deicing boot’s upper surface. The IRT test results were used in NASA’s computational studies, which indicated
that these pronounced ice ridges tended to act as stall strips, creating more disrupted airflow over
the airfoil’s upper surface, further decreasing the lift produced by the airfoil, and resulting in a
lower stall AOA than the rough ice accretions alone. NASA’s computational study data
indicated that a thin, rough ice accretion with a small, prominent ice ridge can result in a lower
stall AOA and a more dramatic drop off/break than the 3-inch ram’s horn ice shape commonly
used during initial icing certification testing. The implications of this finding for FAA icing
certification criteria are discussed in section 2.6.2.
The accident airplane’s performance displayed evidence of adverse effects on
both lift and drag during the airplane’s descent to 4,000 feet msl. The degradation exhibited by
the accident airplane was consistent with a combination of thin, rough ice accumulation on the
impingement area (including both upper and lower wing leading edge surfaces), with possible
ice ridge accumulation. Thus, based on its evaluation of the weather, radar, drag information,
CVR, existing icing research data, and postaccident icing and wind tunnel test information, the
Safety Board concludes that it is likely that Comair flight 3272 gradually accumulated a thin,
rough glaze/mixed ice coverage on the leading edge deicing boot surfaces, possibly with ice
ridge formation on the leading edge upper surface, as the airplane descended from 7,000 feet msl
to 4,000 feet msl in icing conditions; further, this type of ice accretion might have been
imperceptible to the pilots.</div>

affected the conspicuity of the ice accumulation, making it difficult to perceive the ice
accumulation during the icing exposure periods. NASA-Lewis’s scientists described the IRT ice
accretions as mostly “glaze” ice, like mixed or clear ice in nature, although it looked slightly like
rime ice when the IRT was brightly lighted for photographic documentation of the ice accretions
because of its roughness. The Safety Board notes that it is possible that such an accumulation
would be difficult for pilots to perceive visually during flight, particularly in low light conditions. This type of accumulation would be consistent with the accident airplane’s CVR, which did not
 
173 Although the Safety Board considered other possible sources for the aerodynamic degradation
(such as a mechanical malfunction), the physical evidence did not support a system or structural failure, and the
FDR data indicated a gradual, steadily increasing performance degradation that was consistent with degradation
observed by the Safety Board in data from events in which icing was a known factor.
174 All pilot reports indicated moderate or less ice accretions, except the pilots of NW flight 272,
who reported that they encountered a trace of rime ice during the descent, then encountered moderate-to-severe
icing at 4,000 feet msl about 2 minutes after the accident.

record any crew discussion of perceived ice accumulation and/or the need to activate deicing
boots during the last 5 minutes of the accident flight. The location of rough ice coverage observed during the icing tunnel tests varied,
depending on AOA; at lower AOAs, the ice accretions extended farther aft on the upper wing
surface (to the aft edge of the deicing boot on the upper wing surface, about 7 percent of the wing
chord at the aileron midspan), whereas at higher AOAs, the ice accretions extended farther aft on
the lower wing surface. In some IRT test conditions, sparse feather-type ice accretion extended
aft of the deicing boot coverage on the lower wing surface (which extends to about 10½ percent
of the airfoil chord at the aileron midspan) as far as 30 to 35 percent of the airfoil’s chord.176
The density of the rough ice coverage also varied, depending on the exposure
time; a sparse layer of rough ice usually accreted on the entire impingement area during the first
30 seconds to 1 minute of exposure, and the layer became thicker and more dense as exposure
time increased.</div>

wing leading edge deicing boot segments were most recently replaced in July 1996—it strains credibility to presume
that the pilots and mechanics who examined the airplane’s leading edges during preflight and maintenance
inspections between July 1996 and the day of the accident did not observe inconsistently applied conductive edge
sealer. Further, during postaccident interviews, Comair’s maintenance personnel appeared to be very familiar with
the conductive edge sealer application.

whether the lack of conductive edge sealer on the upper wing surface at the aft edge of the
leading edge deicing boot had potential to act as a preferred ice accumulation location. The
NASA-Lewis scientists stated that it was unlikely because there were no perceivable tactile
differences (gaps, edges, roughness, etc.) between the leading edge deicing boot and the wing
skin to trigger ice accumulation. More importantly, the NASA-Lewis scientists stated that IRT
tests had demonstrated that ice accretion that far aft on the upper wing surface would be unlikely
to occur in a non-SLD icing environment—it would be more likely to occur in larger SLD
droplet sizes, because of the resultant runback and secondary ice accumulation. The Safety Board concludes that the accident airplane’s left roll tendency was
precipitated by a thin layer of rough ice that accumulated on the leading edge of the wing during
the airplane’s cruise descent and was then affected by some or all of the following factors: the
autopilot-commanded left roll, asymmetrical ice self-shedding, aileron deflection effects
(localized airflow separations), the effects of engine/propeller thrust, the asymmetrical engine
power application, and the disengagement of the autopilot. It is unlikely that the absence of
conductive edge sealer on the left wing leading edge deicing boot segments was a factor in the
airplane’s excessive left roll.

Use of Deice/Anti-ice Equipment
The Safety Board attempted to determine whether the airplane’s ice protection
systems were operated during the accident airplane’s descent and approach to Detroit
Metropolitan/Wayne County Airport (DTW). CVR information showed that when the pilots
performed the descent checklist at 1547, they confirmed that the airplane’s “standard seven”
anti-ice systems were activated and activated the windshield heat and the propeller deice
system.180 This was consistent with guidance contained in Comair’s EMB-120 Flight Standards
Manual (FSM), which stated that anti-ice systems should be activated “before flying into known
icing conditions” to prevent ice accumulation on the affected surfaces.</div>

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] The flightcrew&#x27;s apparent lack of concern regarding the prolonged
operations in icing conditions may have been influenced by their extensive
experience of safely flying commuter aircraft in winter weather conditions, especially
in icing conditions that are prevalent in the Great Lakes region. In addiction, they
were probably confident in the ability of the airplane deicing system to adequately
shed the ice that had been accumulating on the wings and in their ability to perform
safely under the existing circumstances. The flightcrew was operating in icing
conditions that exceeded the limits set forth in 14 CFR Part 25, Appendix C,
resulting in a complete loss of aircraft control. However, the insidious nature of
these icing conditions was such that the ice accumulation on the observable portions
of the wings, windshield and other airframe parts was most likely perceived by the
flightcrew as nonthreatening throughout the holding period. Moreover, the
flightcrew was undoubtedly unaware that the icing conditions exceeded the
Appendix C limits and most likely had operated in similar conditions many times
prior to the accident, since such conditions occur frequently in the winter throughout
the Great Lakes and northeastern parts of the United States.

193
Further, the flightcrew entered the holding pattern with the belief that
the holding would be of a short duration, unaware that it would be continually
extended in short increments for a total of 39 minutes. Therefore, the Safety Board
concludes that if a significant amount of ice had accumulated on the wing leading
edges so as to burden the ice protection system, or if the crew had been able to
observe the ridge of ice building behind the deice boots or otherwise been provided a
means of determining that an unsafe condition could result from holding in those
icing conditions, it is probable that they would have exited the conditions. The Safety Board is aware that ATR provided information to the
operators of its airplanes that indicated that encounters with certain freezing
precipitation conditions could result in “roll axis anomalies.” However, this
information was vague and did not indicate to flightcrews how to determine that they
were in freezing rain, nor did it specifically alert them that encounters with freezing
rain could result in sudden autopilot disconnects, uncommanded aileron movements
and rapid roll excursions. Therefore, the crew of flight 4184 had no reason to expect
that the icing conditions in which they were operating could cause the autopilot to
disconnect unexpectedly because of the onset of an aileron hinge moment reversal
and cause a loss of normal, stable aileron control. In addition, ATR did not provide,
nor did the regulatory authorities require, training or guidance to pilots about the roll
axis “anomalies” or the recovery techniques if such an event should occur. Thus, the
Safety Board concludes that the crew of flight 4184 was not provided with adequate
information by the manufacturer or the regulatory authorities to recognize and cope
with the problems they experienced during an encounter with freezing rain.</div>

caution alert, it is possible that it was activated by one of the other aircraft systems. Assuming the chime at 1533:56 was activated by the ice detection system, consistent
with the drag increase noted at that time on the FDR, the Safety Board concludes that
the flightcrew’s failure to increase the propeller RPM to 86 percent and activate the
Level III ice protection system was not a factor in the accident because: 1) according
to ATR, the increased propeller RPM is necessary to increase the ice shedding
capabilities of the propeller blades; 2) the increased propeller RPM will prevent the
formation of ice aft of the deice boots in the area of the propeller slipstream, but will
not prevent the formation of ice on the wing in the areas behind the deice boots, in
front of the ailerons, or the airflow over the ailerons. There was no discussion recorded on the CVR to suggest that the flight
crewmembers had a safety concern about the icing conditions in which they were

191
holding. Two comments by the crewmembers recorded on the CVR indicated they
were aware that ice was accreting on the airframe. The first comment, “I’m showing
some ice,” occurred about 9 minutes before the initial upset of the airplane, and the
second comment, “we still got ice” occurred about 2 minutes before the upset. Neither comment indicated the type or amount of ice, nor did the comments suggest
that the crew was aware the ice accretions were related to an encounter with freezing
drizzle or freezing rain. The comments only indicate that the flightcrew was aware
that they were operating in an icing environment. Further, the flightcrew responded
appropriately to the caution alert at 1541:07 by increasing the propeller RPM to 86
percent and activating the deice boots 5 seconds later, or about 16 minutes before the
upset. Although AMR Eagle cautioned pilots in its 1989 memorandum about
flight in freezing rain, the information and training provided by Simmons
Airlines/AMR Eagle to its flightcrews did not prohibit holding in icing conditions
that were perceived to be within the capabilities of the airplane. In addition, the crew
did not have specific training or information necessary to determine that the airplane
was operating in conditions (freezing rain) beyond those for which it had been
certificated. It is generally understood that flight in icing conditions in any aircraft at
low airspeeds with the flaps and/or the landing gear extended for a long period of
time is not a good operating practice because such exposure increases the likelihood
of a significant accumulation of ice on the flaps and/or landing gear, which could
result in increases in weight and drag, and a decrease in aircraft performance.</div>

4) Severe - The rate of accumulation is such that deicing/antiicing equipment fails to reduce or control the hazard. Immediate flight diversion is necessary. While these icing severity definitions provide some basis for assessing
ice accumulation in PIREPs, they are subjective and are of limited use to pilots of
different aircraft types. For example, using these definitions, &quot;light&quot; icing for a
Boeing 727 could be &quot;severe&quot; icing for an ATR 72 or a Piper Malibu. The icing
report provided by the captain of the A-320 Airbus that was holding at the HALIE
intersection, near Roselawn, indicated that he observed about 1 inch of ice
accumulate rapidly on his aircraft&#x27;s icing probe. The captain provided a PIREP to
ATC and reported the icing as &quot;light rime.&quot; He stated in an interview after the
accident that the anti-ice equipment on the airplane &quot;handled the icing adequately,&quot;
and he believed the icing intensity to have been &quot;light to moderate.&quot;

166
The Safety Board concludes that icing reports based on the current icing
severity definitions may often be misleading to pilots, especially to pilots of aircraft
that may be more vulnerable to the effects of icing conditions than other aircraft. The Safety Board believes that the FAA should develop new aircraft icing intensity
reporting criteria that are not subjective and are related to specific types of aircraft. In addition, the investigation revealed a problem with the aviation
community&#x27;s general understanding of the phrase &quot;icing in precipitation,&quot; which is
used by the NWS but is not defined in any aeronautical publications, including
advisory circulars (ACs), Part 1 of the Federal Aviation Regulations or the
Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM). This phrase is often contained in in-flight
weather advisories; however, it does not typically specify types of precipitation. According to the NWS, this phrase is intended to include freezing drizzle and
freezing rain. The Safety Board concludes that defining “icing in precipitation” in
such publications would make pilots and dispatchers more aware of the types of
precipitation and icing conditions that are implied by this phrase. Therefore, the
Safety Board believes that the FAA should provide a definition of the phrase &quot;icing
in precipitation&quot; in the appropriate aeronautical publications.</div>

determination of the aerodynamic effect of ice on 4 specific airfoil is not a requirement in the certification of the aircraft. Even if this were a requirement, it would be virtually impossible
to determine the aerodynamic penalties of the various shapes and
textures of ice that may be accumulated in flight. Studies conducted by the National advisory Commtt tee for
Aeronautics and later by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Féederal Aviation Administration publications, and the textbooks previously cited, have confirmed that airfoil icing does
result in aerodynamic penalties and that, {{n general, these penalties
result in higher etall speeds and lower stall angles of attack,

In view of the foregoing, the Board conctudes that airfoil
{{cing existed to such an extent that substantial aerodynamic penalties were imposed, These penalties, while not precluding the aircraft from becoming airborne and briefly establishing a positive
rate of climb in ground effect, resulted in a stall as soon as it
lost the advantage of ground effect, Accordingly, except for
ground effect, the aircraft probably would not have become airborne
under the existing circumstances, I -

The experience level of the flightcrew in this aodel aircraft
was minimal, However, the Board believes that the relatively low
level of experience should not have been a factor in the accident,
since icing effect on the airfoils of an aircraft is basic knowledge
required of all certificated pilots, While ice is more critical on
a thin swept-wing aircraft, the same basic precautions are applicable
to all aircraft regardless of airfoil design. The Board concluded that the validity of information provided
by the speed command system and the stall warning. system with an
iced airfoil is questionable, A stall can occur with an iced airfoil at a lower angle of attack than that programaed for the stall
warning system and, under extreme icing conditions, the validity of
the information provided by the speed command system becones questionable, However, proper use of the airfoil antisice system and proper
deicing of aircraft prior tc departure would éliminate this opera-.
tional consideration, I

The popping and torching of the engine near the time of the
stall resulted from engine compressor stalls caused by the crew&#x27;s
manipulation of the throttles during their attempted recovery and
subsequent abandonment of the takeoff, and disturbed engine inlet
airflow resulting from the stabled attitude of the aircraft. This
phenomenon has beén observed in other jet aircraft accidents.</div>

explained that as the ice did not cause hia any problem on approach
and landing, he did not expect it to give him a probles on takeoff.

_ He further stated that during his previous flying career in Douglas
DC-3, Martin 404, and Fairchild F-27 atreraft, he had at tines mad:
takeoffs with ice adhering to the airfoils, following an approach
and landing with the ice, in which no difficulty was experienced,

The Board further concludes that under the circumstancea, the
aircraft should have been detced before takeoff, Studies, actual
experience, training, and the regulations have long emphasized the
aerodynamic penalties of takeoff with ice adhering to the airfoils,

« 26 -

NASA studies have determined that the magnitude of the aerodynamic
penalties resulting from an iced airfoil were primarily a function

of the shape and size of the ice formation near the leading edge

of the airfoil, These studies also showed that rotation of an iced
airfoil to angles of attack, other than that at which icing occurred,
caused sufficiently large changes in the pitchitng-moment coefficient
that, in flight, rapid corrections in trim might be required in

order to avoid a hazardous situation. This would seem to be confirmed
by the two training incidents in which unexpected violent rolls and
delayed recovery were experfenced during approach to stalls with
known or suspected airfoil ice,

requirement was clearly identified on the completed wefght and balance

and balance form, they read it erroneously, or they were not thoroughly
knowledgeable of the power requitements of this aircraft, Although
the crew had satisfactorily completed the prescribed training in this
model aircraft, their actions on this flight did not demonstrate a
thorough knowledge of the thrust requirements or of the use of the
anti-ice systems, While {{t cannot be substantiated that the use of
el power would have prevented this accident, the increased acceleration would have increased the probability of a successful takeoff,

Although tower personnel, a number of passengers, and ground
witnesses thought that the takeoff acceleration of this aircraft was
slow, 4 comparison of the acceleration, as determined from the flight
data recorder with the computed expected acceleration, disclosed that
the acceleration was very near the computed expected acceleration for
the power setting selected, The setting actually used by the crew
for this takeoff, while not in accordance with performance requirements, was adequate to permit a successful takeoff on Runway 35,
with clean airfoils, The increased power required for the existing
gross weight is stipulated to meet the single-engine climb requirements in the event of an engine failure following takeoff.

_ The flightcrew confirmed that lift-off did occur and that a
positive rate of climb was noted prior to theloss of control, The
review of the flight data recorder readout indicated that lift-off
occurred at near the computed perfor.sance lift-off speed. This
might seem to question the influence of the aerodynamic effect of I
the ice adhering to the airfoils of the aircraft during this takeoff,

» 27 «

However, studies have confirmed that the increased lift obtained
frou ground effect may permit an aircraft with iced airfoils to
become airborne and subsequently be unable to maintain fiight when
entering the area of reduced Lift leaving ground effect,

The accurate weight, size,and shape of the ice adhering to
this aircraft at the time loss of control was experienced could
not be determined; therefore, the extent of aerodynamic penalties
resulting from this {{ce accumulation could not be determined. Also,
determination of the aerodynamic effect of ice on 4 specific airfoil is not a requirement in the certification of the aircraft. Even if this were a requirement, it would be virtually impossible
to determine the aerodynamic penalties of the various shapes and
textures of ice that may be accumulated in flight.</div>

The first officer called Vp L1 knots early, and the captain rotated
about 5 knots early. His rotation rate was about 2.5 degrees per
second. The airplane accelerated normally during the takeoff roll. After
liftoff and before transitioning to the initial climb, the wing
stalled before the stall warning system activated. Lateral instability was caused by an irregular stall progression
across the wing that led to an abrupt left roll and wing tip strike
that further reduced the ability to climb. The airplane experienced a wing lift deficiency because of ice
contamination. The initiation of rotation for takeoff at a speed about 5 knots
below the prescribed speed resulted in a higher peak AOA at
liftoff and, with the wing contamination, eliminated any AOA
stall margin that might have existed with a normal rotation. According to wind tunnel studies conducted by the
manufacturer, a wing upper surface roughness consisting of
particles only 1-2 mm diameter (0.04-0.08 inch), at a density of
about one particle per square centimeter, can cause lift losses on
the F-28 wing of about 22 and 33 percent, in ground effect and
free air, respectively. The first officer observed the wing from the cockpit and stated
that he checked the black strip for ice accumulation. The black
strip was intended to aid in detection of in-flight leading edge ice
and, because of its location on the leading edge, is not effective
for detecting upper surface ice. At night, flightcrews cannot visually detect minute amounts of
ice on the part of the wing that is visible from the cockpit
windows. This part of the wing is 30 to 40 feet from the
cockpit. Flightcrews also may not be able to detect such
contamination from the cabin windows.

Runway 13/3! was not significantly contaminated, and runway
conditions were properly reported at LaGuardia on the night of
the accident. Accident history shows that nonstatted, turbojet, transportcategory airplanes have been involved in a disproportionate
number of takeoff accidents where undetected upper wing ice
contamination has been cited as the probable cause or sole
contributing factor. No specific injury pattern could be identified in the cabin to
explain why some passengers survived the accident and others
did not. Passengers who sustained minor injuries and injuries that were
not life threatening most likely drowned as a result of confuston,
disorientation or entrapment or a combination of these factors. At the time of the accident, procedures for opening emergency
door exits were inaccurately and incompletely displayed on
USAir&#x27;s F-28 passenger safety briefing cards, but they did not
contribute to the fatalities in the accident. The locations of the dike, pump house, and ILS localizer ground
plane antenna were within current FAA guidelines; however, the
locations did not meet [CAO Annex 14 criteria.</div>

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] Thus, it is probable that, during the transition to climb
immediately after liftoff, the airplane reached an AOA beyond the stall AOA with
significant loss of both lift and lateral control effectiveness. The abrupt roll that
occurred during the takeoff of flight 405 is consistent with this analysis. The
replication of events in the Fokker F-28 simulator confirmed that, with a
contaminated wing, AOAs as high as 12 degrees, well into the stall regime, were
reached even when the pilot initiated rotation at the proper speed to a target pitch
attitude of 15 degrees ata rate of 3 degrees per second. The following is from a Fokker document”! on the effect of wing ice
contamination on the F-28 wing:

With frost roughness present on the wing upper surface the
characteristic of slow stall progression towards the wing tip is lost
and uncontrollable roll may develop at angle of incidence (attack)
as low as 10 degrees...The drag of the clean wing is such that the
aircraft is capable of climbing away at the required climb angle at
V2 with one engine inoperative. In the case of a contaminated wing
the drag may, however, be doubled due to a wing stall which occurs
at an angle of incidence (attack) only slightly greater than that for

21 Fokker Report L-28-222 “Note on the Aircraft Characteristics as Affected by Frost, Ice or
Freezing Rain Deposits on Wings,” dated December 16, 1969.

stick shaker operation. Consequently, acceleration is lost even with
ail engines operating at T.O. power. Most wings are designed so that the inboard sections will stall before
the outboard sections. This design ensures that roll control can be maintained
through use of the ailerons on the outboard wing sections. However, the variable
distribution of ice particles and shorter chord length on the outboard sections of the
wing usually create an irregular stall distribution across the wing. A premature stall
of the outboard sections usually occurs first, with a resultant loss of lateral control. A significant nose-up pitching moment would also be expected in swept wing
aircraft when the outboard wing sections stall. However, the sweep angle of the
F-28 wing is only 16 degrees, and wind tunnel tests conducted by Fokker indicate
that a nose-down pitching moment can occur following a contaminated wing stall. In any event, it was apparent from the evidence that after liftoff, the
airplane could not transition to a positive climb angle during the 11 seconds that it
was airbome before striking the dike. The maximum air speed recorded by the FOR
during the 11 second flight was 134 knots, stick shaker activated at this time, and air
speed then decreased and varied between 130 and 128 knots for the remainder of
the flight. According to the Fokker simulation data, at this speed, the airplane

should have been able to sustain a load factor of 1.5 G at the stick shaker threshold
AOA which would still have provided about a 3-degree AOA stall margin.</div>

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] Conversely, a greater rate of precipitation
accumulation would have had the effect of reducing the holdover time of flight 405. The Safety Board believes that given the numerous variables and
complexity of the problem, the specific amount of ice that accumulated on the
aerodynamic surfaces of the airplane during the taxi phase is indeterminable. However, the Safety Board also believes that some contamination occurred in the
35 minutes following the second deicing and that this accumulation led to the
control difficulty shortly after rotation.

2.9 Flightcrew Performance - Takeoff Procedure and Stall Recovery

The Safety Board views the evidence as conclusive that the primary
factor in this accident was the reduced performance of the wing due to ice
contamination. Therefore, the Safety Board evaluated the extent to which the
decisions of, and procedures used by, the flightcrew could have contributed to the
accident. After arriving at the USAir gate following the landing at LaGuardia,
both the captain and the first officer departed the airplane for short pertods, and both
of them were aware that the weather conditions were conducive to the accumulation
of frozen precipitation on the wings. Upon retuming to the airplane, neither of them
performed a walkaround inspection or took any special actions to check the
condition of the wing leading edge and upper surface. However, the airplane was
subsequently deiced and the wing condition was purportedly checked by ground
personnel which obviated the need for the crew to depart the airplane a second time
for an extemal inspection. That the captain requested a second deicing after about a
20-minute delay indicated his concem about the continuing exposure to
precipitation; the request was prudent and in accordance with USAir guidance. Following the second deicing, the flightcrew was most likely satisfied that the
airplane was free of adhering contamination. The flightcrew was not aware of the exact delay that they would
encounter before takeoff and their decision to leave the gate was reasonable. After
taxiing, when it became evident that they would be delayed for a prolonged period,
conversations between the crew showed that they were aware of and probably
concemed about the risk of reaccumulating frozen contamination on the wing. Their
awareness of this risk should have been heightened by the need to use the
windshield wipers intermittently in combination with the freezing outside air

temperature. When it became apparent that the delay would exceed 20 minutes,
USAir guidance prescribes a careful examination of the airplane&#x27;s surfaces. The
first officer stated after the accident, and passengers confirmed, that he had tumed
on the wing inspection light to view the wing on several occasions.</div>

Accident Sequence
2.2.1 Descent Into Icing Conditions
Surface observations and radar data indicated that freezing drizzle conditions
existed in the PUB area around the time of the accident and that temperatures were below
freezing from the surface to 30,000 feet. Several PIREPs and NWS products transmitted
around the time of the accident, including winter weather advisories that warned of
freezing drizzle, confirmed the presence of icing conditions in the PUB area. CVR Analysis
28
Aircraft Accident Report
evidence indicates that, starting about 0851, the flight crew began taking actions to
minimize the icing’s hazardous effects, such as activating the airplane’s engine and
windshield anti-ice systems. About 4 minutes later, the first officer stated that he saw a
little bit of “grayish ice,” which is indicative of ice that has a rough surface, building up on
the wing leading edges. He then stated that there was “a real thin line back there.” 
An analysis of the CVR and meteorological information indicated that mixed icing
conditions existed from about 21,000 to 14,000 feet. Radar data and CVR information
indicated that the airplane was in this icing layer for about 5 1/2 minutes. At 0858:20, as
the airplane was descending through about 18,000 feet, the first officer suggested to the
captain that he might want to cycle the deice boots.54 After cycling the deice boots, the
captain indicated that the deice boots might have shed a little of the ice but that some ice
remained on the wing, indicating the presence of residual ice. 
2.2.2 Approach to Landing 
In accordance with the SimuFlite Cessna Citation V Technical Manual and the
Cessna Model 560 Citation V AFM, pilots were trained that, when any residual ice is
present or can be expected during approach and landing, Vref must be increased by 8 knots. The manuals also contained both a caution and a warning indicating that stall speeds
increased during operations in icing conditions, and that, therefore, Vref must be increased. At 0859:29, the CVR recorded the first officer state that the Vref was 96 knots. In
the case of this flight, the Vref should have been increased from 96 to 104 knots because of
the icing conditions. The CVR did not record either pilot mention increasing the airspeed
at any point during the approach.</div>

Aircraft Accident Report
Further, icing tunnel tests conducted as part of the Comair flight 3272 accident
investigation indicated that the effects of ice accretion on airplane performance could vary
widely depending on the size, distribution, and type of ice accumulated on the airplane’s
surfaces. However, the Board learned that manufacturers are not required to demonstrate
an airplane’s flight handling characteristics or stall margins using thin, rough ice that can
accrete on protected surfaces before the activation of the deice boot system or between
activation cycles. As a result of its findings, the Board issued Safety Recommendation
A-98-92, which asked the FAA (in cooperation with NASA and other interested aviation
organizations) to do the following:
[C]onduct additional research to identify realistic ice accumulations and …
determine the effects and criticality of such ice accumulations … the information
developed … should be incorporated into aircraft certification requirements. The Safety Board also issued Safety Recommendation A-98-100, which asked the
FAA to review the icing certification of all turbopropeller-driven airplanes currently
certificated for operation in icing conditions, perform additional testing, and take action as
required to ensure that these airplanes fulfill the requirements of the revised icing
certification standards asked for in Safety Recommendation A-98-92. The

Conclusions 3.1
Findings
1.
The captain and first officer were properly certificated and qualified under Federal
regulations. No evidence indicated any preexisting medical or physical condition that
might have adversely affected the flight crew’s performance during the accident
flight. A review of the pilots’ 72-hour histories revealed that they slept well in the
days leading up to the accident flight and went to bed early in preparation for an early
departure. No evidence was found that fatigue degraded the performance of either
pilot on the day of the accident.
2.
The weight and balance of the airplane were within landing limits.
3.
The recovered components showed no evidence of preexisting powerplant, structural,
or system failures.
4.
The Pueblo Memorial Airport local controller did not provide the accident flight crew
or the Denver Flight Service Station with the pilot report reporting light to moderate
icing; however, this was not a factor in the accident because cockpit voice recorder
information indicated that the flight crew was aware of the icing conditions.
5.
During the approach, the flight crew of the sister ship, which was following the
accident flight, cycled the deice boots numerous times and maintained a high airspeed
and, subsequently, landed safely, indicating the importance of taking these actions to
counteract the hazardous effects of icing.
6.
The flight crew did not increase the landing reference airspeed while operating in
icing conditions, contrary to company procedures and manufacturer guidance.
7.
The airplane encountered supercooled large droplet (SLD) conditions, which are most
conducive to the formation of thin, rough ice on or aft of the protected surfaces,
during about the last 4 1/2 minutes of the flight. Further, the airplane had residual ice
on the wings after the deice boots were activated earlier in the flight, and this ice
would have affected the overall thickness, roughness, and distribution of the SLD ice
accumulation.
8.
The flight crew did not activate the deice boots when configuring for the approach
and landing, which was contrary to company procedures and manufacturer guidance. 
9.
The flight crew failed to maintain adequate airspeed during the final approach in icing
conditions, which led to an aerodynamic stall from which they did not recover. Conclusions

Aircraft Accident Report
10. Pilots could benefit from the reinforcement during training of the Cessna Model 560
Citation V Airplane Flight Manual requirements to increase the airspeed and operate
the deice boots during approaches when ice is present on the wings.
11. The briefing conducted late in the approach was a distraction that impeded the flight
crew’s ability to monitor and maintain airspeed and manage the deice system.
12. All operators would benefit from an increased focus on providing monitoring skills in
their training programs, including those operating under 14 Code of Federal
Regulations Parts 121 and 135, as would pilots completing Federal Aviation
Administration-approved training programs for Part 91 operations.

vacuum-operated deicing boots on the leading edges of the airfoils would
be able to remove only that ice immediately adjacent to and on the boot,
leaving a large area of the airfoils subject to ice accretion, This la.ter
ice could only be removed by operating the aircraft in an area where
the ambient temperature would melt the ice. In view of che abovo, the Safety Board concludes that the most
likely reason for the inability to climb to a higher altitude was an
accretion of ice which increased the aircraft&#x27;s gross weight and decreased thw lifting efficiency of the airfoils,

The pilot, accompanied by his wife and five children, was
returning to his hoine in Michigan, He received a personal weather
brieting it the flight service station at Savannah. Although no record
of the contents of the briefing was made, routine briefings normally
include information from the current surface weather chart, terminal
sequence reports, SIGMETS and AIRMETS, radar summary reports,
and winds aloft reports--all of these data were available to the briefer
and to the pilot. From the weather information that was available to the pilot,
he should have known that moderate-to.-severe icing was forecasted
for part of his intended route. In addition, he should have known that
the owner&#x27;s manual advised pilots tc avoid known icing conditions when -
ever possible. The pilot&#x27;s radio communicctions through various stages uf
‘the flight indicated that he was concerned about the avoidance of
thunderstorm3, about icing conditions, about the erratic operation of
one of the engines, and about his occasional inability to receive VOR
stations. Nevertneless, the pilot continued on his preplanned flight
and at 1911:20, following a series of radio communicetions with ATC
about icing, about the aircraft&#x27;s climb performance, anc about vibrations,
he requested ATC assistance to get to an airport. The controller recognized the need for assistance and began to
collect airport end weather information to provide priority service to
the distressed pilot. Although the pilot did not, on this occasion, declare an emergency, the controllers treated the situation as an emergency and initiated actions to orovide priority hanaling for the flight. The controller did not, nor was he required to, notify the pilot that
the flight was receiving priority handling. Possibly, had the controller
told the pilot that he was considered to be an emergency and had ne requested specifically the pilot&#x27;s desire, the pilot might have been able
to participate more actively in planning a course of action. The controller interpreted the pilot&#x27;s transmission at 1911:35

J), The maximum gro3s takeoff weight was exceeded
at takeoff; the center of gravity was within limits. The weight and balance cannot be computed for the
time of the impact because the amount and distribution of airframe icing cannot be determined.

‘*

2. There is no evidence of a preimpact malfunction of
either powerplant. Both engines were developing
relatively high power when the aircraft struck the
trees.

3, The flight operated in conditions conducive to airframe and induction icing for about 46 minutes.

4. The Safety Board coule not determine if the installed
deicing equipment was used or if the equipment was
used properly,

5. The pilot planned, initiated, and continued a night
IFR flight in an area of thunderstormis ard forecasted and reported icing.

6. The communications difficulties experienced by the
pilot probably resulted from a combination of ice
accretion on the aircraft radio antennas and terrain
interference at the lower flight altitudes.

7. The pilot&#x27;s ability to make a decision was degraded
by the stress cf the numereus problerns he encountered,

&amp; While the air traffic control personnel provided
assistance to the pilot in accordance with their under -
standing of the established prcecedures, the controllers
failed to seek specific information regarding the degrees
of deterioration of the pilot&#x27;s and the aircraft&#x27;s abilities
to deal with the adverse conditions. (b) Probable Cause

The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the
probable cause of the acciden: was a controlled collision with the terrain,
while the flight was receiving radar vectors in night IMC conditions,
because structural icing prevented the pilot from climbing to a safe
altitude. Contributing to the accident were the pilot&#x27;s failure to appreciate the severity ci the weather he could expect to encounter and to take
the initiative to divert the flight vefore his options were reduced, and the
controllers&#x27; failures to take more timely and forceful action to seek more
specific infermation regarding the degree of deterioration of the pilot&#x27;s
and aircraft&#x27;s ability to deal with the adverse conditions.

3, RECOMMENDATIONS

The Safety Board recommends that pilots and controllers study
the circumstancas of this accident and decide how they could have r2sponded to the conditions involved in this flight in a way that would have
prevented the accident. Pilots, as certificated airmen, must understand the importance
of a thorough preflight weather analysis, particularly with respect to
forecasted and known icing conditions or other severe weather along the
intended route of flight, Pilots should know and heed the precautions
and operating limitations set forth in the airplane owner&#x27;s manual,
aircraft operating manual, and other approved operating instructions. Pilots should plan their flights with regard to those precautions and
operating limitations and avoid encounters with icing or other severe
weather. Pilots should be conservative in their decisions to exercise
the privileges of their airman&#x27;s certificutes and consider their level of
experience, recency of experience, the aircraft&#x27;s capability, and pilot
workload before committing themselves to a flight. It is extremely
important that pilot&#x27;s carefully weigh the need to complete the flight

against the potential hazards of attempting the flight.</div>

ground navigation aids, including the ARTCC radar and communications
equipment,

The aircraft&#x27;s gross weight at takeoff exceeded the maximurn
limits established by the owner&#x27;s manual; however, -ne load was distributed in the aircraft so that the center of gravity was within established
limits. The center of gravity stayed within established limits as fuel
was conaumed and the aircraft&#x27;s gross weight decreased. The Safety
Board could nut deterrnine the distribution or the amount of ice that had
accumulated on the aircraft. The evidence indicated that the pliot could maintain straight
and leve] flight. The rnajor problem was his inability to regain altitude
after he had descended tu 3,000 feet during the approach to Lonesome
Pine. The evidence relating to the powerplants indicates that full
engine power wa3 available and was being use’. The Safety Board
could not determine the specific engire malfunction being descrihed
by the pilot; however, it is possibla that induction icing caused the
malfunction, Since the fucl (right engine) selector was found set on
the left main fuel tank, the pilot may have telieved that he had a fuelflow problein and decided tc operate both engines from the left tank,
However, both propellers were in the high rpm range and showed
evidence of relatively high rotational speed at impact. The tree damage
attributed to propeller slashes indicated that the engines were developing relatively high powe-.

The first communication problems were encountered at 1728,
when the pilot changed communications frequencies, However, there
were other cornmunications prollems later in the flight; these may
have been caused by icing of the: aircraft radio antennas, by signal
obstruction by high terrain, or by some unidentified problems with the
aircraft&#x27;s radios. Additionally, the pilot twice reported difficulty in
recniving VOR stations; however, as he came closes to the stations,
he was able to receive them and used them for navigation. After the pilot first reported icing at 1904, about 46 minutes
before che crash, the remainder of the flight was flown in conditions
conducive to svructural icing. The aircraft was equipped with vacuumoperated deicing boots on all the leading edges and an electric deicing
system on the propellers, The pilot did not mnention veing these devices and the Safety Board was not able to determine irom the wreckage
whether they had been used. Clear ice caused by freezing rain can cover all the upper
surfaces of an aircraft in flight and the deicing equipment will remove
only the ice in the area of the equipment, Because the propellers were
dej:ed by electrical heating of the boot, there probably was little, if
any, ice on the propellers and they retained their efficiency. The
vacuum-operated deicing boots on the leading edges of the airfoils would
be able to remove only that ice immediately adjacent to and on the boot,
leaving a large area of the airfoils subject to ice accretion, This la.ter
ice could only be removed by operating the aircraft in an area where
the ambient temperature would melt the ice.</div>

of these factors were examined on the EMB-120 engineering simulator: drag due
to sideslip and ice accretion. Drag due to Sideslip

The captain’s observation that the ball in the turn-and-slip indicator was
slewed full left and that the rudder trim wheel was trimmed 10 units right
immediately before the loss of control indicated that the airplane was in a left
sideslip as it approached the stall. The FDR lateral acceleration and control wheel
position parameters show that a left sideslip developed about 20 seconds before the
autopilot disconnect. However, as the airplane slowed during the climb, right rudder trim would
have been required to balance the normal left turning forces produced by propeller
effects at high angles of attack. At 140 KIAS, the airplane would have required
about four units of nose-right rudder trim. Thus, the sideslip resulting from full
nose-right trim was less significant than it would have been at a higher climb
speed. When examined in the engineering simulator, it was evident that the
reduction in climb performance resulting from the sideslip drag was less than that
encountered on the accident flight. Furthermore, because of the short time of the
sideslip condition, the Safety Board believes that the out-of-trim condition was not
a factor in the loss of control. Effect of Ice Accretion

The meteorological data and the observation of other pilots indicate that the
conditions present at the time of the accident were conducive to the accretion of
ice on the airplane’s aerodynamic surfaces, which would have affected
performance. The airplane was in clouds as it climbed above the freezing level
at 11,500 feet and was exposed to freezing temperatures and visible moisture for
over 7 minutes before the loss of control occurred. While the effect of ice on
aerodynamic performance is well known, the ability to quantify the effect in terms
of the lift decrease and drag increase associated with specific amounts of ice is

22

limited. Embraer had aerodynamic performance data available for a wing having
an inch or more of rough rime ice on the leading edge. When these data were
examined in the simulator, the noted degradation in the airplane’s climb
performance was far greater than the degradation evident for flight 2733. Although the captain and first officer both stated that they had not observed
ice on the wings, there is no evidence that they looked for ice at any time during
the climb above freezing level. The passenger’s observation of a whitish substance
on the windshield, which appeared to be snow, would be consistent with some
amount of ice accretion. The Safety Board believes that an accretion of ice on the wing is the only
reasonable explanation for the occurrence of stick shaker activation and loss of roll
control at higher-than-expected airspeeds.</div>

on the windshield, which appeared to be snow, would be consistent with some
amount of ice accretion. The Safety Board believes that an accretion of ice on the wing is the only
reasonable explanation for the occurrence of stick shaker activation and loss of roll
control at higher-than-expected airspeeds. The Safety Board believes that only a
small amount of ice on the wing’s leading edge could have had a significant effect
on the aerodynamic performance under the circumstances of this flight. If the
airplane accumulated ice during the climb above 11,500 feet while at a relatively
low angle of attack, the ice would have formed at the stagnation point® associated
with that angle of attack. As the airplane slowed, the corresponding inorease in
angle of attack would have resulted in a movement of the stagnation point lower
on the leading edge. Thus, the ice that had formed at the higher speed would be
above the new stagnation point and produce a greater disruption of the air flow
over the wing upper surface leading to premature boundary layer’ separation. The
result would be a progressive reduction in the lift produced by the wing and a stall
at a lower angle of attack. In past aviation accident investigations, the Safety
Board has determined that almost imperceptible amounts of ice, 1/4 of an inch or
less, on the wing leading edge has significantly increased the stall speed and lateral
control capability of the airplane. Thus, the Safety Board believes that ice accumulated during the climb and
resulted in a stall at higher-than-normal speed. While it is likely that the accretion
of ice alone would not have led to a stall had the captain attempted to maintain a

airflow diverges to pass above and below the wing so that the local airflow velocity is zero.

target airspeed instead of a target pitch attitude, the Safety Board cites the captain’s
inattention to ice accretion as a factor in the accident. Propeller Failure

Evaluation of the FDR, FDAU, and CVR data revealed that operation of the
engines and propellers was normal until after the loss of control occurred. This
information corresponded with the crew’s statements. Evidence obtained after the
accident from the left engine indicated that at some point the engine had been
operated under extremely high vibratory loads at low engine speeds. The FDR
revealed that the right engine and propeller continued to operate within normal
parameters until the collision with the terrain as the airplane departed the runway
during the landing. The Safety Board considered and could not conclusively discard the
possibility that the nacelle damage was caused by the maneuvering and air loads
imposed on the structure during the out-of-control descent. If this were the case,
the distortion of the nacelle and engine mounts could have moved the propeller
control linkage to feather, which in turn would have resulted in a less of blade
centrifugal loads, which permitted the blades to separate.</div>

Board evaluated data contained in past reports of similar secidents, as well as
psychological literature discussing the factors that contribute to breakdowns in decision
making and monitoring capability. These areas ‘ineluded boredom, monotonous
environmental conditions, fatigue due to circadian desynchronosis, and over-reliance on
automated flight systems. In addition, the manner in which the first officer and flight
engineer performed during the loss of control sequence was also evaluated in relation to
the above areas. Although the first officer was capeble of either flying the airplane or assisting
the flight engineer in his analysis of the loss of thrust on the No. 4 engine, the captain did
not ‘ask him specifially with either chore. During this period, the additional task levied
on the first officer was to obtain clearance from Oakland ARTCC to descend, and the
captain did not direct the first officer to obtain an emergency descent clearance. The
facts showed that the first officer performed his communications duties in a timely
manner; that he had warned the captain of the decreasing airspeed and the increasing
right bank; that after the No. 4 engine flamed out he had, without informing the captain,
instrueted the relief flight engineer to come forward and help the flight engineer restart
the No. 4 engine; and that he came to the captain&#x27;s assistance on the flight controls
without being instructed to do so, Although the first officer was subject to fatigue,
boredom, and the same monotonous environment as the rest of the crew, and although he
had less off-duty titne during the flight than the captain and flight engineer, he seemed to
have performed his assigned duties and overall wonitoring tasks in a timely manner. Given these factors, the Savety Board cannot state with any confidence tat any of the
psychological factors that could have reduced his capability to perform affected his
actions during the accident sequence. The facts, limited as they are, indicate that his
performance was unaffected by these factors.

‘With repard to the captain and flight engineer, both men were performing in @
time spectrum that was later than their typical sleep periods. Although both men had
taken a $-hour rest during the flight, the quality of their rest during this period cannot be
equated to that which would have been achieved by slea) either at home or in a hotel. Their duty tasks consisted of routine monitoring of the performance of the airplane&#x27;s
automated flight systems, a task that is repetitive and monotonous and capable of
producing a state of boredom, The existence of these conditions required the Safety
Board to examine the possibility that they might have influenced and derogated the
manner In which the flight engineer and captain performed during the emergency. The flight engineer&#x27;s performance before, during, and efter the loss of control
disclosed actions that were correct and timely and other actions that deviated from the
required checklist procedure or that demonstrated that he had been unable to analyze
correctly the portrayal of the airplane&#x27;s engine instruments.</div>

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] The Safety Board also concludes that the captain
over-relied on the autopilot and that this was also causal to the accident since the
autopilot effectively masked the approaching onset of the loss of control of the airplane. Although tne Safety Board has cited distraction and over-reliasice on the
autopilot as causal factors, it also notes that the airplane had been airborne avout
10 hours, that it had traversed several time zones, and that the upset occurred about 0214
Taiwan local time, or about four to five hours after the eaptain had been accustomed to
going to sleep. Thus, his ability to obtain, assimilate, and analyze all the data presented
to him could have been impaired by the effects of monotony, boredom, and fatigue. However, 1n analysis of the captain&#x27;s performance does not support a conclusion that the
his performance was impaired by these factors. Tne facts and circumstances showed that
the captain was alert to the situation as it developed. The data also showed that the
captain had five hours rest during the flight, that he had slept two hours during this
period, and that he had been at his duty station about 3 hours when the upset occurred. The Safety Board concluded that the preponderance of the evidence showed that the
deviations and omissions from prescribed airplane procedures noted in the captain&#x27;s
performanee resulted from the causal factors cited earlier, i.e., distractio. and overreliance on the autopilot. In conclusion, the Safety Board believes that the loss of thrust on the No. 4
engine was the precipitating factor in the accidents however, we do not believe that it
should be eesidered a contributory factor. Except on takeoff, nt, or shortly after critical
engine failure speed, an engine loss does not require an emergency procedure wherein
immediate and memory actions are required of the flightcrew. An engine loss at cruise
altitude and at eruise speeds does not place the airplane in immediate jeopardy nor, for
the most part, are any immediate responses required of the flightcrew to retrieve the
airplane from jeopardy. ‘The facts of this accident confirm this evaluation since the loss
of control did not occur until more than 3 minutes after the No. 4 engine had lost thrust. More than enough time was available to the flighterew to react properly and prevent the
upset. This fact was amply demonstrated on two previous flights for this airplane in
which similar situations occurred; the malfunations were corrected, and the airplane
proceeded to scheduled destinations without further incident. The Safety Board is aware of present and proposed Nationa] Aeronautics and
Space Administration (NASA) studies on the effects of cireadian desyachrenosis on
flighterew performance and efficiency. NASA has recently concluded a study of the
effect of circadian desynchronosis on the performance of flightcrews engaged in shorthaul flignts, but has not, to date, releasad its findings.</div>

In the event of an abnorme! fiight condition, company policy and the AOM
dictated that the captain assume control c? che airplane and direct the other crew
members to deal with the abnormal condition. Since the captain was at the controls when
the flight engineer told him that the No. 4 engine did not accelerate, there was no need
for him to take any further action other than to monitor the flight engineer&#x27;s attempts to
analyze the engine&#x27;s performance and restore it to normal operation. He did not
disengage the autopilot since it relegated the tasks involved with flying the airplane to
merely monitoring the autopilot&#x27;s performance. Had he disengaged the autopilot, as
recommended in his training, he would have been required to perform the physical, more
difficult, and more time and attention consuming tasks involved with flying the airplane
manually, I

The effects of the asymmetrical thrust condition began to assert themselves
at about 1011:10, and the No. 4 engine flamed out about 1012:42. Based on the decrease
in pitch attitude and the subsequent momentary airspeed increase, the Safety Board
eoneludes that the the PMS was disengaged about 1014:30. Based on the initial
movements of the control wheel from its 22.9° left-wing-down position, the Safety Board
also concludes that the autopilot was not disengaged until 1014:50. During the 3 minute
40 second period of deceleration, the staternents of the captain and flight engineer
showed that the captain was totally cognizant of the engine situation, and thereafter, his
attenticn appeared to focus almost exclusively on the airplane&#x27;s decreasing airspeed. According to the captain, he had disengaged the autopilot in order to lower the nose of
the airplane faster and recover airspeed. Although he said that he was aware that the
airplane had entered a right bank, he was apparently not aware of the magnitude of the
right-wing-down attitude. The Safety Board concludes that one of the causal factors of *he accident was
the captain&#x27;s reliance on the autopilot while the airplane was decelerating. During this
3 minute 40 second period, the captain allowed himself to remain removed from the
&quot;control loop&quot; by leaving the autopilot engaged. As a result, he was net aware of the
increasing control inputs required to maintain level flight.</div>

the accident investigation group sevealed that
after a loud explosion was heard none of the
three crewmembers checked the engine instruments to ascertain their problem or whether
they had lost one engine or both engines. The
first officer stated, “numerous amber lights on
the overhead panel came on, The 3 system low
quantity light, two or three lights on my master
caution panel came on. At this time, it seemed
to me that the Icft engine began to ‘spool
down’.”’ The captain related that he believed he
saw the right engine instruments spooling down. None of the crewmembers could recall what the
airspeed was or the altitude at the time of the
“loud bang,” only thac it happened about the
normal time of pear retraction. Is is difficult to understand, without a check
of the engine and flight instruments, how the
captain: determined that both engines had failed
and why a decision to land was made immediately. This decision to land was made by the
captain who stated, “I applied additional power
with no response. There was no audible sound of
power from either engine, nc additional rudder
feel, no increase in airspeed.” ‘The captain&#x27;s

assutaption tha: both engines had failed must
diave been based on the decrzase in engine noise,
no increase in airspeed, and no additional rudder
feel, This hasty decision to land must have been
based on the captain’s sensory faculties rather
than on aircraft and engine instrumentations. This conclusion is verified by the second
officer&#x27;s stat:ment, in part, that the captain
“moved bod, throttles forward at this time bur
there was no response and the aircraft began
settling.” Ele “then made an instantancous
decision to sce the aircraft back on the runway.”

the cockpit voice recorder and flight data
recorder sowed that the time interval from the

shown vas approximately 50 feet. Six seconds
after the loud explosion the aircrafe started
descending. The pilot&#x27;s decision and action

the station agent, the captain may have thought that any accumulation of
snow on the wings’ surfaces was either insignificant or would be blown
from the wings while taxiing. In this respect, he might alsu have been
misled by the condition of the deicer boots, which were essentially
clean. In any event, the captain did not take the proper precautions to
insure compliance with company directives and Federal aviation regulations. Consequently, the Safety Board concludes that the captain&#x27;s decision to
take off without insuring that ail snow had been removed from the aircraft&#x27;s
control and lifting surfaces was the cause of the accident.

cn wath ND Sea Bl gS BE MTN LS AAI TIER,

The accident again illustrates that in order co insure the
level of safe operaticn desired from a professional pilot, he must
take the proper measures to insure that wings, stabilizing surfaces, and
control surfaces are clean and free of ice, anow, or frost before he
attempts a takeoff. Further, any doubts about the matter must be resolve,
by visual inspectton--if necessary, immediately before the takeoff is
begun. 3. CONCLUSIONS

Finuings

1. The flightc-rew was properly certificated and was
qualified for the flight.

2. The aircraft was aicworthy, and it was certificated and
maintained in accordance with existing regulations and
approved procedures,

There was no evidence of a failure or malfunction of any
of the aircraft&#x27;s structure or systems, including flight
control sytems, flight instrument systems, and powerplants. The aircraft had been deiced 20 to 30 min before takeof*;
however, about 1/4 in. of wet snow had accumulated on the
top of the wings and horizontal stabilizer before the
captain taxied the aircraft for takeoff.

cxzean and free of siuow before he began the takeoff roll. Flight 561&#x27;s takeoff roll was norma) and it conformed to
predicted performance vaiur. Shortly after liftoff, the aircraft pecame laterally urStable; it roJ.led to the right, then to the left, back
to the right, and its right wing struck the rursay. The snow adhering to the outboard sections of the wing
probably caused those sections to stall prematurely. The stalling of the outboard sections of the wings
caused a loss of lift and significantly reduced the
effectiveness of the ailerons, which resulted in lateral
control problems and lateral instability. The lateral oscillation of the aircraft further decreased
lite and caused the aircraft to lose altitude and crash. The accident was survivable for the passengers. One passenger was fatally injured because her seatbelt
was net fastened. The accident was marginally survivable for the flightcrew
becaus® the cockpit structure was crushed inward, which
reduced the occupiable space, particularly for the first

adhered to the outboard surfaces of the wings of Flight 561, the normal
stall characteristics of the wings were reversed. Consequently. the
ailerons became at least partially ineffective before the wings lost
enough lift to prevent the aircraft from ciainting. Although ground
effect probably provided added lift and reduced drag, once the aircraft
had ascended to 70 ft above the runway, the increased angle of attack
needed to maintain the required lift coefficient as the aircraft climbed
out of ground effect, placed at ieast the outboard portior. :f the wings
in a stall condition. This reduced lift and diminished a! .con effectiveness. The aircraft then entered successive rolls to the right, left,
and right as the pilot attempted to compensate for the loss of aileron
authority. Since a banked attitude decreases the vertical component of
sift, increases in either angle of attack or airspeed, or both, are
needed to maintain level or climbing flight when the aircraft rolls into
a bank. In this case, when the aircraft entered successive rolls,
airspeed probably could not be increased because power was at maximum
for takeoff and further tucreases in the angle of attack aggravated the
stall condition. Consequently, the aircraft lost altitude during the
rolling maneuvers and crashed. The loss of lateral control, therefore,
was the primary impediment to the pilot&#x27;s capability to maintain flight. The Safety Board believes that the stail warning horn never sounded,
which indicates that the stall occurred at an angle of attack below th-t
for which a stall woule nermally be expected and even below the threshold
for stall warning. Snow or frost on an airfoil wili prouuce such a
change in the aerodynamic characteristics of the airfoil.

77 Tid. Since the captain of Flight 561 could not recall any of the
events associated with the accident, the Safety Board was not able tv
determine why he decided to take off with snow on the aircraft&#x27;s wings,
in spite of the station agent&#x27;s advice that the aircraft&#x27;s wings and
horizontal stabilizer were covered with snow. The Safety Board believes
that the captain may not have been completely aware of the condition of
the wings because they are cn top of the aircraft&#x27;s fuselage, about 12 ft
above ground level. However, the captain should have considered the
rate of snowfall which increased significantly during the 20- to 30-min
period before takeoff. Further, after receiving the information from
the station agent, the captain may have thought that any accumulation of
snow on the wings’ surfaces was either insignificant or would be blown
from the wings while taxiing. In this respect, he might alsu have been
misled by the condition of the deicer boots, which were essentially
clean. In any event, the captain did not take the proper precautions to
insure compliance with company directives and Federal aviation regulations.</div>

customer, most likely further heightened the pressure on the flight crew to land at ASE. The operational pressure on the flight crew probably resulted in the crew’s intent 
to continue with its original plan to land at ASE. FAA Advisory Circular 60-22, 
“Aeronautical Decision Making,” indicates that pilots, particularly those with 
considerable experience, try to complete flights as planned, please passengers, and meet 
schedules, which can compromise safety and impose an unrealistic assessment of piloting 
skills under stressful conditions. Also, human performance researchers have noted that 
pilots tend to adhere to their original plan of action, which interferes with critical analysis 
processes that are needed to adequately reevaluate the suitability of the original plan and 
explore an alternate course of action. As a result, “plan continuation errors” occur; that 
is, pilots elect to continue with an original plan of action despite the presence of cues 
suggesting that the course of action needs to be modified.58 In addition, research has 
demonstrated that individuals, when faced with a choice between alternatives, generally 
seek out information that confirms a chosen hypothesis and ignore or fail to fully

consider contradictory information, particularly when workload is high and time 
constraints are imposed.59 
 
In this accident, the flight crew focused on cues that supported the goal of landing 
at ASE, such as occasional breaks in the clouds and the report of one airplane (N900MF) 
that had landed at the airport without incident. By focusing on such cues, the crew did 
not adequately consider information that supported a change of plans, such as the 
deteriorating visibility, the three reports of missed approaches (the last of which, 
involving N527JA, occurred after the accident airplane passed the Red Table VOR), and 
the failure to establish and maintain visual contact with the runway environment as the 
approach proceeded. Instead, the flight crewmembers might have viewed this 
information as a barrier to achieving their intended goal of landing at ASE, causing them 
not to recognize the increasing evidence supporting the need for an alternate course of 
action. Visual Factors

accumulation would have had the effect of reducing the holdover time of flight 405. The Safety Board believes that given the numerous variables and
complexity of the problem, the specific amount of ice that accumulated on the
aerodynamic surfaces of the airplane during the taxi phase is indeterminable. However, the Safety Board also believes that some contamination occurred in the
35 minutes following the second deicing and that this accumulation led to the
control difficulty shortly after rotation.

2.9 Flightcrew Performance - Takeoff Procedure and Stall Recovery

The Safety Board views the evidence as conclusive that the primary
factor in this accident was the reduced performance of the wing due to ice
contamination. Therefore, the Safety Board evaluated the extent to which the
decisions of, and procedures used by, the flightcrew could have contributed to the
accident. After arriving at the USAir gate following the landing at LaGuardia,
both the captain and the first officer departed the airplane for short pertods, and both
of them were aware that the weather conditions were conducive to the accumulation
of frozen precipitation on the wings. Upon retuming to the airplane, neither of them
performed a walkaround inspection or took any special actions to check the
condition of the wing leading edge and upper surface. However, the airplane was
subsequently deiced and the wing condition was purportedly checked by ground
personnel which obviated the need for the crew to depart the airplane a second time
for an extemal inspection. That the captain requested a second deicing after about a
20-minute delay indicated his concem about the continuing exposure to
precipitation; the request was prudent and in accordance with USAir guidance. Following the second deicing, the flightcrew was most likely satisfied that the
airplane was free of adhering contamination. The flightcrew was not aware of the exact delay that they would
encounter before takeoff and their decision to leave the gate was reasonable. After
taxiing, when it became evident that they would be delayed for a prolonged period,
conversations between the crew showed that they were aware of and probably
concemed about the risk of reaccumulating frozen contamination on the wing. Their
awareness of this risk should have been heightened by the need to use the
windshield wipers intermittently in combination with the freezing outside air

temperature. When it became apparent that the delay would exceed 20 minutes,
USAir guidance prescribes a careful examination of the airplane&#x27;s surfaces. The
first officer stated after the accident, and passengers confirmed, that he had tumed
on the wing inspection light to view the wing on several occasions.</div>

door exits were inaccurately and incompletely displayed on
USAir&#x27;s F-28 passenger safety briefing cards, but they did not
contribute to the fatalities in the accident. The locations of the dike, pump house, and ILS localizer ground
plane antenna were within current FAA guidelines; however, the
locations did not meet [CAO Annex 14 criteria. The overall emergency response was effective and contributed to
the survivability of the airplane&#x27;s occupants; however, the
response by the emergency medical services personnel was
inadequately coordinated, and the ambulance response times to
the hospitals were excessive. The difficulties that the air traffic controller experienced with the
emergency telephone system did not hinder or delay the ARFF
response. 3.2 Probable Cause

The National Transportation Safety Board detennines that the prebabie
causes of this accident were the failure of the airline industry and the Federal
Aviation Administration to provide flightcrews with procedurcs, requirements, and
criteria compatible with departure delays in conditions conducive to airframe icing
and the decision by the flightcrew to take off without positive assurance that the
airplane&#x27;s wings were free of ice accumulation after 35 minutes of exposure to
precipitation following deicing. The ice contamination on the wings resulted in an
aerodynamic stall and loss of control after liftoff. Contributing to the cause of the
accident were the inappropriate procedures used by, and inadequate coordination
between, the flightcrew that led to a takeoff rotation at a lower than prescribed air
speed.

78 4. RECOMMENDATIONS

As a result of this investigation, the National Transportation Safety
Board makes the following recominendations:

--to the Federal Aviation Administration:

If gate holds are required to limit deicing fluid holdover time,
encourage air traffic control (ATC) to initiate the gate holds as soon
as a deicing operation begins rather than after delays have exceeded
15 minutes, as in the current air traffic control definition of gate
hold. (Class Il, Prionty Action) (A-93-19)

Where deicing operations are conducted away from the departure
runway, report taxi delays in conditions conducive to airframe icing
in increments that are less than {{5 minutes to provide more realistic
and useful reports to dispatchers and flightcrews. (Class H, Priority
Action) (A-93-20)

Require that flight crewmembers and appropriate ground personnel
responsible for the inspection of transport-category airplanes for
wing contamination receive specific periodic training that will
illustrate what contamination looks like and feels like on a wing and
the amount of contamination that is detectable under different light
conditions. (Class IT, Priority Action) (A-93-21)

Study the effects on performance of swept-wing turbojet airplanes
when specific amounts of air speed are added to the computed
roiation speed (delayed rotation) during takeoffs when wing
contamination is possible. (Class HN, Priority Action) (A-93-22)

Require Fokker to detemnine how takeoff performance and stall
margin would be affected by using a lower initial target pitch
attitude on F-28 and F-100 airplanes in the event that undetected
upper wing ice contamination is present, and change the nommnal!</div>

the flighterew was characterized by a lack of preparation and anticipation. The standard
cockpit duties were accomplished; however, there were no discussions by either flightcrew
member of the need for special consideration for the conditions present at the airport and
their potential effects on the instrument approach. The specific events which indicate a
lack of preparation and anticipation were: no request for an update of actual weather
when it was obvious that it was worse than the ATIS weather; no request for clarification
of reported surface winds despite the admission by both the captain and the first officer
that neither completely understood the nature of the surface winds; awareness of a
thunderstorm reported by a controller, but no effort to establish the location of the
thunderstorm cell, although the first officer complained that the ATC transmissions of
thunderstorm activity were not helpful because he was not provided a location; flying the
airplane into the center of the thunderstorm before a missed approach was started; lack
of anticipation of thunderstorm-associated heavy rain, hail, and turbulence--there was

~43-

no discussion or anticipation of the classic headwind-tailwind effects of a thunderstorm on
the airplane--and lack of recognition of the onset of the effects of wind shear on airplane
performance or cockpit instruments. The cumulative effect of the lack of anticipation and preparation was a state
of confusion in the cockpit and a subsequent breakdown in the decisionmaking process. The captain&#x27;s belief that the airplane was being &quot;pushed down&quot; was actually the decreasing
indicated airspeed as the airplane slowed from the wind shear encounter and was not an
actual loss of altitude. One other characteristic of an encounter with a decreasing
headwind is that the airplane&#x27;s nose will pitch down, which, in this case, required further
control inputs from the captain and reenforced his belief that he was descending. The
actual status of the airplane could have been determined from the cockpit instruments
available to him and the first officer and from better anticipation and preparation based
on existing information. As a result, the captain&#x27;s decision to land was not dictated by the
physical circumstances of the accident but by his incorrect interpretation of information,
his incorrect perception of what was happening to the airplane, and the inadequate
anticipation and preparation for the developing state of flight. Contributing to the ineffective cockpit management was the absence of
eockpit coordination. Good cockpit coordination, which is the responsibility of both
flighterew members, requires constant analysis and assessment of flight conditions. Aside
from routine checklist procedures, there was no indication that the flighterew actually
discussed or participated in analytical discussions of conditions affecting the flight, the
feasibility of discontinuing the instrument approach, or the need for additional
information. The first officer, aside from his standard checklist duties, did little to support
the captain or to provide assistance or information. In fact, although he admitted doubt
about the location of the thunderstorm, the actual airport surface wind conditions, and
the actual weather conditions at the airport, he did not ask for more information from
controllers or raise his concern about these doubts to the captain.</div>

and ice-contaminated runway in a snowstorm after the fifth flight segment of the day. The

snowy) weather conditions throughout the day, and it is unlikely that they wanted to

fatigue and a desire to end the trip (and their day) influenced the pilots’ continuation of 
the approach despite evidence that they should either delay the approach or divert to an 
alternate airport. The Safety Board concludes that the poor decision-making shown by the accident 
pilots, including their failure to account for the changing weather and runway conditions 
during the approach; their failure to perform a landing distance calculation; and their 
failure to reassess or discontinue the approach accordingly, likely reflected the effects of 
fatigue. Scientific literature indicates that people typically underestimate their level of 
fatigue,72 especially when they are busy, as the pilots would have been when preparing for 
and departing on the accident flight. During postaccident interviews, both pilots indicated 
that they did not realize how tired they were until they reached cruise altitude during 
the accident flight. This is consistent with CVR evidence, which shows that complaints 
of fatigue and yawning began during this relatively low workload phase of the flight. Because the accident trip involved a series of delays because of dispatch, maintenance, 
and deicing issues, the pilots may have felt alert when they committed to the trip but 
found that they were tired as they set up for the approach into TVC (which occurred 
almost 2 hours later than scheduled). Pinnacle had a policy that allowed pilots to remove 
themselves from trips because of fatigue; however, the accident pilots did not elect to 
do so, possibly because they did not recognize their level of fatigue until they were en 
route.

failure to reassess or discontinue the approach accordingly, likely reflected the effects of 
fatigue. Scientific literature indicates that people typically underestimate their level of 
fatigue,72 especially when they are busy, as the pilots would have been when preparing for 
and departing on the accident flight. During postaccident interviews, both pilots indicated 
that they did not realize how tired they were until they reached cruise altitude during 
the accident flight. This is consistent with CVR evidence, which shows that complaints 
of fatigue and yawning began during this relatively low workload phase of the flight. Because the accident trip involved a series of delays because of dispatch, maintenance, 
and deicing issues, the pilots may have felt alert when they committed to the trip but 
found that they were tired as they set up for the approach into TVC (which occurred 
almost 2 hours later than scheduled). Pinnacle had a policy that allowed pilots to remove 
themselves from trips because of fatigue; however, the accident pilots did not elect to 
do so, possibly because they did not recognize their level of fatigue until they were en 
route.

2.2.3 Human Factors
During the accident flight, both crewmembers made basic errors in flight
management and the completion of routine tasks, including required callouts.207 In
addition, the flight crew did not appear to be effectively evaluating the weather cues that
were available or considering their cumulative effect, specifically, that the thunderstorm
had likely already arrived at the airport. The Safety Board recognizes that the flight crew
was provided with only general, advisory information on severe weather avoidance rather
than specific operational decision-making criteria regarding the penetration of convective
activity (see section 2.3.1.1). However, the Safety Board concludes that the flight
crewmembers’ performance during the accident flight was degraded, as evidenced by
their operational errors and impaired decision-making. The flight crew’s degraded performance was inconsistent with the level of
performance that would have been expected from both pilots, considering that the captain
was a chief pilot and check airman and that the first officer, as a new hire, had been
recently trained in American’s standards and procedures. Also, the flight crew’s
performance deviated significantly from the positive statements that other pilots made
about both pilots’ skills, abilities, and cockpit style. The captain was described in
postaccident interviews as a conservative pilot who used common sense, demonstrated
wisdom and experience, and was professional. The first officer was described in
postaccident interviews as an above-average new hire who was very competent and
knowledgeable and an experienced pilot with good cockpit discipline, and his
probationary file contained favorable comments about his performance. In addition, the
captain was appointed to the chief pilot position because he possessed good technical
skills and leadership abilities. Factors that contributed to the flight crew’s degraded
performance—situational stress and fatigue—are discussed in section 2.2.3.1 and 2.2.3.2,
respectively. The pairing of the first officer, a new hire who was 5 months into his probationary
year, with the captain, a chief pilot and check airman with over 10,000 flight hours (more
than half of which were as an MD-80 captain), was evaluated and determined not to be a
factor in the accident. Although it is possible that a probationary first officer might find
speaking and challenging a captain who is a chief pilot to be difficult, CVR evidence
indicated that this first officer was assertive during most of the flight for which CVR
information was available.</div>

Track” when he had the initial movement of the localizer needle on his horizontal situation indicator,
nor did he call out “Outer Marker” and the msl crossing altitude as the airplane crossed the outer
marker beacon on the ILS approach course. Finally, he did not call out “Landing” before descending
below the decision altitude, which would have confirmed that he had adequate visual reference with
the runway. The first officer did not challenge the captain on these required Category I ILS callouts. Also, neither pilot made the required “radio altimeter alive” callout, and the first officer did not

1,000 feet per minute. Analysis

command the final landing flap configuration. Further, the first officer was instrumental
in directing the captain to the airport during the attempted visual approach.
2.2.3.1 The Role of Situational Stress 
The presence of weather as a potential threat to the safety of flight and efforts to
expedite the landing were stresses to the flight crew. Research has demonstrated that
decision-making can be degraded when individuals are under stress because they
selectively focus on only a subset of cues in the environment. As a result, any situation
assessment may be incomplete, and the resulting decision, even when made by an expert,
may be degraded. Stress can also impede an individual’s ability to evaluate an alternative
course of action, resulting in a tendency to proceed with an original plan even though it
may no longer be optimal. Research on decision-making has demonstrated a natural
tendency for individuals to maintain their originally selected course of action until there
is clear and overwhelming evidence that the course of action should be changed (see
section 1.18.3.2). 
The CVR contained no evidence to indicate that the flight crew had reevaluated
its original plan to expedite the landing because of the approaching weather. The actions
taken by the flight crewmembers throughout the approach were consistent with their
original plan. Despite several cues that indicated that the weather at the airport had
deteriorated, neither crewmember discussed a need to initiate a go-around, enter a
holding pattern, or divert to an alternate airport. The Safety Board also notes that any
delay in landing would have further extended the pilots’ duty day, but there is no
evidence to indicate that this factor affected the flight crew’s decision to continue the
approach.</div>

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] Despite the thundershowers north and south of DFW, as AALl 02 
proceeded to the ILS approach to 17L, there were no weather conditions that made 
the decision of the captain to initiate or continue the approach unacceptable. Although the airplane was in a I 0-degree right crab on short final to l 7L, this 
condition was not inherently unsafe. The DC-8, which had landed on 18R about 4 
minutes before AAL102, had reported a &quot;smooth ride&quot; that had been passed by an 
approach controller to AAL102. Also, on approach to 17L behind AAL102, an SA340 captain, who flew a missed approach beginning about 600 feet agl, reported that 
he experienced light to moderate turbulence during the approach and no windshear 
activity. The captain of AAL102 was well within his authority to take the 
airplane from the first officer after the first officer had announced, without prior

96 
warning, that he was going to go around. The fact that the captain was able to land 
the airplane on centerline provides evidence that he was in control of the airplane 
through the touchdown. No clear evidence exists that there was any fault in the 
captain&#x27;s decision-making throughout the initiation or continuation of the approach 
to l 7L, or in his decision to take control of the airplane from the first officer and 
land on the intended runway. The departure from the runway resulted from the 
captain&#x27;s failure to maintain directional control of the airplane after touchdown 
rather than from events or decisions made prior to touchdown. Finally, in light of the captain&#x27;s improper aircraft control during the 
landing roll, the relatively long duration of this overnight flight, and the fact that the 
captain&#x27;s sleep periods were disrupted in the 48-hours prior to the accident, the 
Safety Board considered the possibility that fatigue adversely affected his 
performance. These factors and the captain&#x27;s age of 59 years lead the Safety Board 
to believe that the captain might have been fatigued to some extent. Even though 
the circumstances surrounding the flightcrew&#x27;s activities from April 12 through 14 
could have led to a deterioration of his judgment and piloting skills, there is no 
information available regarding the captain&#x27;s ability to perform under either longterm or short-term fatigue. Therefore, a finding that his performance on the accident 
flight was the result of fatigue could not be supported; nor could it be dismissed. 
2.6 
AAL Pilot Training Program and Recordkeeping 
The Safety Board attempted to obtain information about the quality of 
the past training and checking performance of the flightcrew of AAL102 from 
American Airlines, but was unable to do so because of the lack of detailed 
information in the records. The FAA-approved recordkeeping system only provided 
information on when pilots completed required actions such as flight checks. Their 
performance on the checks, or even the number of unsuccessful checks, was not 
included. As a result, the Safety Board was unable to determine if the quality of the 
performance of the flightcrew on AALI 02 was an aberration or was consistent with 
a performance decrement.</div>

thin clouds, which would likely have allowed a visual descent to land. However, the pilot did not

that it is possible that the pilot did not transmit the position to signal his intent to land but instead 
sent the signal to the ground crew to indicate the position of the balloon after it had flown through 
clouds. If this were the case, he may have elected to extend the flight to meet passenger 
expectations of a flight lasting about 1 hour. Regardless of the reason for sending the position

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] There was no evidence to suggest such
a malfunction, although the gyro could not be tested because of impact and fire damage. However, since the pilot maneuvered accurately to the VOR, the attitude indicator was
probably operating properly. A mechanical failure precisely at the time of the missed
approach is highly improbable. Therefore, the Safety Board believes mechanical failure of
the attitude indicator probably was not a factor in the accident. Pilot_workload.--Several other problems could have occurred and several
conditions could have affected adversely the pilot&#x27;s ability to maintain a olimb attitude,
and conversely could have allowed an unwanted descent to oecur. The pilot&#x27;s instrument
cross-check and visual seen would have included’ et least the following: attitude
indicator, heading Indicator, vertical speed Indicator, altimeter, engine instruments
(setting climb power » flap handle, gear handle, and possibly outside cues such as airport
lights or other objects. All of these items would have had to be scanned during the few
seconds immediately after the missed approach was initiated. The workload on the pilot
would have been extremely high during this short period and would have required precise
and timely perception, decisionmaking, and actions to effect a proper missed approach. Any distraction, such as the passenger&#x27;s scream about an airplane on the runway, any
misperception of cues, or any delayed action under these cireumstances could have caused
an unwanted descent that was not detected in time to évcid ground contact. The rate of
descent required to cause the accident is rather high and should have been readily
Apparent to the pilots however, it could have gone undetected for a few seconds, which
would have been sufficient to cause the accident. Physiological factors, --Sensory illusions, vertigo, or spatial disorlentation can
cause a pilot to not detect a deviation, to interpret cues incorrectly, to take inappropriate
action, or to take no action when action fs required. Any of these conditions can occur
during instrument flight; however, the possibility of them occurring Is greater at night,
during aircraft configuration changes, and when accelerations (aireraft maneuvering)
occur, i.e. turns, climbs, and power changes. Also, the transition from instrument
references to visual references and back to instrument references can induce illusions or
disorlentation. Moreover, if the pilot looked out the left wiadow in reaction to the
passenger&#x27;s screain about an airplane on the runway or because of his own sighting of the
ground or other features, the head and eye movemerts associated with this action could
nduce disorientation,

The ¢nly way for a pilot to overcome sensory Illusions {{s to monitor
continuously and to rely on the attitude indicator, and to cross-check the other flight
instruments, including the altimeter ar. vertical speed indicator, to verify that the
aircraft is performing as desired. Unfortunately, when a pilot Is experiencing !llustonary
events, the pilot may not detect an improper Instrument indication because the pliot’s
Sensory organs are sending false messages to the brain.</div>

runaway trim condition could have gore undetected for a sufficient length of time to
place the airplane in a descending attitude that was not detected by the pilot In time to
overpower the mistrim condition and to effect recovery from the descent. Impact and
fire damage precluded positively eliminating the airplane trim system as a causal facter,
and runaway trim could explain the reason for the accident although there {{s no history of
this problem with PA-31 type airplanes. Autopilot use.--If the pilot was using the autopilot to fly the approach and to
execute the missed approach, a malfanction or improper action by the pilot also could
have initiated the descent and gone undetected for a short time. Although the compeny
unwritten procedures and guidance specify that a pilot not use the autopilot for
instrument approaches, the possibility exists that the pilot of N41070 did. The capab&#x27;&#x27; ;
of the Century 41 autopilot to track the inbound course and to hold a desired alti
during the approach would have reduced pilot workload. Similarly, the pilot could have
readily executed the missed approach by means of inputs to the autopilot. Therefore, the
Safety Board could not rule out the possibility that the pilot used the autopilot during the
approach to reduce workload, or merely to see how well it performed. Moreover, the
audio warning described ty the survivor could have been the autopilot disconnect alert. Although the survivor recalled hearing a &quot;bell,&quot; there were no bell-type aural warnings
installed in N41070. The sound of the autopilot disconnect aural warning is a bong-type
sound which might have been the sound the survivor recalled hearing. If it was, it could
mean that the pilot was using the autopilot during the approach and it was disconnected
during the missed approach. The attopllot could have been disconnected when the pilot
pushed the disconnect button, or when he overrode it by pulling back on the control yoke.
{{ the autopilot malfunctioned and initlated the descent, or the pilot made an improper
input once he recognized the deviation, he would have disconnected the autopilot eitiner
by overciding it or pushing the disconnect.</div>

2.2 Possible Reasons for tire Descent

The Safety Board was not able to Jetermine why the airplane lost altitude and
crashed during the missed approach attempt. Several of the more likely possibilities were
considerad, but none of tham could be confirmed based on the available evidence. Mechanica) failure.--Flight control or trim malfunctions or flight insteumeut
failures could account for the unwanted descent; however, the damage to and destruction
of the flivht control components and flight instruments precluded a positive conelusicn
that they were functioning properly. However, the Safety Board believes that such
system malfunctions are improbable becuse the airplane was controllable until a few
seconds before impact, the components examined revealed no preimpact failures, and
there was no previous record of malfunctions. The evidence indicates that the pilot
probably recognized the unwanted descent at the last moment and that he attempted to
return the alrplane to climbing flight. The Initial ground contact Involved primarily the
propellers cutting sagebrush until the airplane passed through the fence a few seconds
later. The alrplane c auld not have had a high rate of descent at that time or there should
have been extensive ground sears and gouges, and separation of airframe parts. The
airplane remained in the air for about 450 feet after striking the fence, until the first
principal ground contact was made. The only airplane parts in the initial contact area
were the right-engine propeller dome and a piece of right-engine cowling. These pieces
separated when the right engine hit the fenee post. Therefore, the Safety Board
concludes that the airplana&#x27;s descent was virtually nil, and the pilot had nearly recovered
from the descent when the propellers touched the sagebrush and when the right engine
struck the fence. The Safety Board believes that the reason for the unwanted descent was
not @ problem that prevented ascent; rather, it apparently involved a mroblem that was
not recognized in sufficient time to prevent the initial descent and to recever completely. Consequently, the Safety Board concludes that uncontrollable mechanical faflures
probably were rot the reason for tha Joss of altitude. Runaway trim.--Alrplane design ecitecia specify that the pilot be able to

FAA has recently attempted to discover why the malfunctioning of attitude instruments in general aviation
airplanes can result in loss of control in partial panel situations. See, for example, D.B. Beringer and
J.D. Ball, “When gauges fail and clouds are tall, we miss the horizon most of all: General Aviation pilot

disorientation. See Benson, “Spatial Disorientation—Common Illusions,” 1999.

pull-up maneuver was great enough to overload the horizontal stabilizer downward and
the right outboard wing section was sufficiently loaded upward to sustain a permanent
bend in the spar. As soon as the horizontal stabilizer fractured and departed the airplane,
the right outboard wing loaded downward and separated from the airplane in a downward
direction. 
2.4
Loss of A.C. Electrical Power
Four possibilities exist to explain the loss of a.c. power aboard the accident
airplane. First, the selected inverter could have failed, and the pilot might not have
switched to the other inverter. However, the pilot should have been familiar with this
switch because it is always used to supply a.c. power after engine start and to terminate
a.c. power before engine shutdown. Second, a dual inverter failure could have occurred. However, it is extremely
unlikely that both inverters would have failed because of the inverters’ history of
reliability aboard King Air 200 airplanes.</div>

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] The Beechcraft Super King Air 200 Pilot’s Operating Handbook also indicates
that, in the event of an electrical system failure, nonessential circuit breakers are not to be
reset in flight, but essential circuit breakers are to be reset.44 However, there was
insufficient evidence to determine whether either pilot attempted to troubleshoot the
electrical problem by examining the circuit breaker panel, which was located on the right
side of the cockpit at knee level. Despite the loss of a.c. electrical power, the pilot could have safely flown and
landed the airplane from the left seat by referencing the available (non-a.c.-powered)
flight instruments on the right side of the cockpit (the altimeter and the airspeed, attitude,
and turn and slip indicators). Also, the pilot could have asked the second pilot to fly the
airplane because the available flight instruments would be more easily viewed from the
right seat. The Safety Board could not determine from the available evidence what actions
the pilot took (or did not take) and the extent to which the pilot might have coordinated
with the second pilot. Nevertheless, the Safety Board concludes that the pilot did not
appropriately manage the workload associated with troubleshooting the loss of a.c.
electrical power with the need to establish and maintain positive control of the airplane.45 
Because mode C data were unavailable after about 1735:44, the Safety Board’s
airplane performance study for this accident was used to estimate the airplane’s altitude
and descent rate after this point. According to air traffic control (ATC) radar data, the
airplane began to turn to the right about 1736:26. The calculated bank angle during this
turn, estimated to be less than 15º initially, increased to more than 80º over the next
30 seconds. Also, airplane performance calculations showed that the airplane entered into
a descent shortly after starting the turn to the right. The estimated descent rate increased
constantly to more than 15,000 feet per minute as the airplane completed a 360º turn. The
Safety Board concludes that the airplane’s estimated flightpath in the final 2 minutes of
flight was consistent with a graveyard spiral resulting from pilot spatial disorientation.46
The pilot probably did not sense the right descending turn at first because the
airplane’s bank was entered gradually. As the airplane’s bank angle and descent rate began
increasing, the pilot’s spatial disorientation most likely persisted, and he was not able to
successfully use the available instruments to regain positive control of the airplane. Any
head movements that the pilot made while attempting to diagnose the electrical system
malfunction (for example, looking down and to the right at the circuit breaker panel)47
might have exacerbated his spatial disorientation because the motion sensing organs of the
44 Because all of the circuit breakers were found open, most likely because of impact forces, the Safety
Board could not determine the positions of the circuit breakers at the time of the accident. 
45 In a postaccident interview, the air safety inspector who conducted the pilot’s March 1998 Part 135
check ride indicated that the pilot tended to “lock in on a problem and not fly the airplane.” This observation
is consistent with the circumstances of this accident.</div>

Aircraft Accident Report
inner ear could have been stimulated by these head movements in addition to the motion
of the airplane. Radar data, ground scars, and wreckage distribution indicated that the airplane
impacted terrain at an angle that was less steep than the descent. The Safety Board
concludes that the airplane’s angle at the time of impact indicated that the pilot attempted
to arrest the descent in the final portion of the flight, possibly in response to obtaining
visual references of the ground after emerging from the lowest layer of clouds.48 The pilot
input and the airplane reaction required to arrest the descent rate with the available altitude
would have placed a large aerodynamic loading on the airplane. The aerodynamic loading
caused the airplane to break apart in flight at a low altitude (within several hundred feet of
the ground) and crash into terrain. The ATC primary radar data returns about 1737:16,
1737:21, and 1737:26 (see figure 1) and the scattered debris found at the accident site
were also consistent with an in-flight breakup at a low altitude. The cockpit and fuselage crown area showed severe impact damage, but the
fuselage belly was not damaged. The airplane was found in an inverted position 125 feet
from its initial impact point with the ground. Thus, the airplane initially impacted the
ground nose first and then bounced 125 feet to an inverted position.
2.3
Breakup Sequence
On the basis of the wreckage distribution,49 the Safety Board determined that the
tail structure sections departed the airplane first and that the outboard section of the right
wing departed the airplane after the tail sections. The pilot likely initiated a severe pull-up
maneuver by pulling back on the control column; this action loaded the tail in the
downward direction and the wing in the upward direction. The Safety Board concludes
that the in-flight breakup occurred because the aerodynamic loading during the pilot’s

problem on the second approach. ATI 815 landed at 0117, and the first officer
noticed the captain&#x27;s flight director oscillate from one dot fly up to one dot fly down. It did not affect the approach, and they made a normal landing. The ILS anomalies experienced by the crews appear to be so random
that they could be explained by many variations, both in the transmitter and the
receiver/displays. Based on tre information presented, some of the needle movement
might be the normal fluctuation when the receiver first responds (particularly in

sufficient to cause that flight to abort the approach. Despite extensive effort, the

anomalies. Accordingly, the ILS is not considered to have been a factor in the
accident.

59 3. CONCLUSIONS Findings

1. The flightcrew was properly certificated and qualified for the
flight in accordance with existing regulations.

2. The airplane was properly certificated and maintained in
accordance with existing regulations.

3. The first officer was flying the airplane upon arrival into the
Toledo area. For undetermined reasons, he failed to properly capture
the ILS localizer and/or glideslope during two ILS approaches.

4, The captain assumed control of the airplane during the second
missed approach; however, he apparently became spatially
disoriented, from physiological factors and/or a failed attitude
director indicator, and he inadvertently allowed an unusual attitude to
develop with bank angles up to 80 degrees and pitch angles up to 25
degrees.

5. The captain transferred control of the airplane to the first
officer when the airplane was nose low and in a left bank angie;
however, there may have been a short period of time when neither
pilot was in control.

6, The first officer assumed control and began leveling the wings
and raising the nose of the airplane, but impact with the ground
occurred before the unusual attitude recovery was completed.

7. The operability of the captain&#x27;s attitude director indicator at the
time control was lost is uncertain. Witness marks on the one attitude
director indicator ball that was found could have indicated an
incorrect position at impact; however, the evidence was inconclusive.

8. Based on the observed performance of the airplane during the
recovery, the first officer&#x27;s attitude director indicator was operating

properly. 3.2 Probable Cause

The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable
cause of this accident was the failure of the flightcrew to properly recognize or
recover in a timely manner from the unusual aircraft attitude that resulted from the
captain&#x27;s apparent spatial disorientation, resulting from physiological factors and/or a
failed attitude director indicator.</div>

as the nonflying pilot. However, there was no subsequent positive verbal transfer of
control to the first officer prior to the loss of contro) during the second go-around. Even if the captain thought he had relinquished control to the first officer pricr to the
control loss, the first officer demonstrated that he considered himtci: the nonflying
pilot when he acknowledged the assigned vector of 300 degrees at 13°.:36.3. This
transmission was made 2.6 seconds before the captain&#x27;s first question, “What&#x27;s the
matter.&quot; In the subsequent 10 seconds until the captain asked, &quot;You got it?” the
situation deteriorated drastically. Although it is possible that neither pilot was flying
the airplane during this period, given his almost constant prompting on the previous
ILS approaches, it is ir probable that the captain allowed the first officer to fly so
poorly without interjecting some instruction or taking control of the airplane again. Also, the positive initiation of the bank angle was not consistent with uncommanded
airplane motions, which suggests that someone was on the conirols.

2.9.2 Spatial Disorientation

The first officer&#x27;s performance on the second ILS resulted in the captain
taking control probably after not having controlled the airplane since the last landing
in Portland. Orcgon, the previous day. There is no question that the captain became
gravely concemed about something 1 minute and 22 seconds after assuming airplane
control, almost immediately after receiving ATC instructions to tum to a heading of
300 degrees, about 22 seconds prior to impact. He asked, &quot;# # what&#x27;s the matter?”
2.5 seconds after the first officer routinely acknowledged the new heading
assignment. About 4.5 seconds later, the captain became very alarmed and
essentially repeated his initial remark. While both comments are nonspecific, the
Safety Board considered the possibility that they reflected a state of perplexity and
confusion, rather than the captain&#x27;s analysis of a mechanical problem with the
airplane. Although the captain was routinely turning to the assigned heading of
300 degrees when control was lost, he had just transitioned from a climb, reduced
power and was still attempting to level at the assigned altitude of 3,000 feet. This
combination of steady, sustained tuming, acceleration-to-deceleration changeover,
and abrupt ascent to descent transition, at night with no visible horizon or outside
references, is especially conducive to spatial disorientation. Medical experts state that deceleration while tuming can produce the
sensation of tuming in the opposite direction. Had the captain of flight 805
incorrectly believed, at about 0325:36, that he was rolling out of his tum to the left
(the opposite direction), he might have increased the bank angle to the left to
compensate. The fact that the airplane was not simultaneously decelerating, turning,
and descending for a very long time before the problem occurred could lessen the
possibility of this phenomenon.</div>

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] Because of these discrepancies and the current state-of-the-art
interpretation of instrument impact markings, the Safety Board was unable to
determine which pitch witness marks occurred at initial ground impact and which
marks were made during secondary impact(s). Therefore, the Safety Board cannot
positively determine whether the captain&#x27;s ADI was malfunctioning and was a causal
element in this accident sequence. Nor can the Safety Board rule out the possibility
that the ADI malfunctioned and precipitated the loss of control by the captain.

2.10 The Recovery Attempt

There is little doubt that there was accurate attitude information
available to the crew, at least from the standby artificial horizon. The display half of
the standby artificial horizon displayed an attitude corresponding to that of impact. Further, it is believed that the first officer&#x27;s ADI was accurate because of his recovery
efforts. His response to the captain&#x27;s release of control was not only immediate (0.7

36

seconds), but it was correct in general execution. The flightpath study indicates that
at the time control of the airplane was transferred, the bank angle had increased to
about 65 degrees, and the flightpath angle was about -15 degrees. The altitude at the
time was about 3,100 feet. The Safety Board&#x27;s research indicates that the descent
angle continued to steepen. Within 4 seconds of the first officer stating, I got it,” the
angle of the bank stabilized at about 80 degrees, the altitude was about 2,600 feet and
the flightpath angle was about -28 degrees. The first officer correctly concentrated
on trying to level the wings for the next 3 seconds. Then, as the bank angle
approached 20 degrees, he began focusing on arresting the descent. Eventually, in
the 12 seconds after he acknowledged assuming control, he recovered the airplane to
the 15 degrees left bank, and the -17 degrees flightpath present at the time of impact. There are several points to be emphasized in evaluating the recovery
attempt. Airline pilots are not periodically trained to recover from unusual attitudes
as are military pilots or civilian acrobatic pilots. The presumption is that an airline
pilot should avoid an unusual attitude and will never have a need to recover from one. Similarly, transport-category aircraft operations contrast with the military and civilian
acrobatic method of flying an airplane. Airline pilots may subconsciously avoid
abrupt maneuvers in the interest of passenger comfort. In this regard, the first officer
had no military and little, if any, acrobatic flight training. Although the captain was a
retired Naval Aviator, he last flew a military airplane in 1979, about 13 years prior to
the accident. There was no indication recorded on the CVR that the captain was
physically involved in the recovery maneuver at all. Once he relinquished control, he
did not even &quot;coach&quot; anymore, until 2 seconds before impact when he joined the
flight engineer in saying, “Up, up....&quot;

he failed to recognize the trainee’s severe disorientation, and atternpted to coach
the trainee through a recovery from an unusual attitude. In the process, the IP lost
awareness of the airplane’s altitude and rate of descent and may have become
spatially disoriented. As a consequence, the airplane entered an uncontrolled
descent and crashed into the ocean in less than 15 seconds. The spatial disorientation of the captain-trainee occurred in large part
because the IP exercised poor judgment in exposing the captain-trainee to a failure
of his attitude indicator followed by the simulated failure of the right engine while
the trainee was maneuvering the airplane at relatively low speeds and a low
altitude on a nonprecision instrument approach on a dark night. The disablement
of the trainee’s attitude indicator without a means of covering the indicator, despite
the trainee’s specific request, was in itself a significant hazard to the trainee’s
spatial orientation because it is difficult to completely ignore the instrument unless
it is covered. As a result, the false indications of airplane attitude as the speed of
the indicator’s operating gyro slowed would have tended to distract and confuse

the pilot. Also, the lapse of almost 6 minutes between disablement of the attitude
indicator and simulated failure of the right engine would have introduced
Significant errors in the indicator’s display of the airplane’s pitch and bank
attitudes. Since there was no mention on the CVR of covering the attitude
indicator, the Board believes that the IP used poor judgment in subjecting the
trainee to such conditions. Almost 6 minutes after disabling the trainee’s attitude indicator, the IP
compounded the trainee’s problems with spatial orientation by simulating the
failure of the right engine, which would have introduced significant lateral and
directional control problems. Failure of an attitude indicator in the BE 1900 did
not constitute an emergency as defined in the pilot’s operating handbook, because
of the airplane’s two independently-powered attitude indicators. Therefore, when
he simulated a failure of the right engine, the IP technically did not introduce
multiple emergencies. However, by not permitting control of the airplane by
reference to the IP’s operable attitude indicator, he effectively created multiple
emergencies for the captain-trainee, which again reflected poor judgment on the
part of the IP. Although it appears that none of the company’s operations specifications or
its operating policies and procedures were disregarded by the IP who was involved
in the accident, the Safety Board believes that considerable more attention and
communication from management was needed to assure adherence to standard
instructional methods and to flight safety. Instead, company management officials
relied on the judgment of the IPs. The evidence indicates that company management officials were not well
informed about the flight training activities within the company, at least with
respect to the BE 1900 airplane and Part 135 training. This probably occurred,
in part, because of the lack of a subordinate program manager for the BE 1900
airplane and the lack of an assistant chief pilot at the principal base.</div>

The airplane probably crashed into the ocean in a near-inverted
attitude with the outboard section of the left wing striking the water
first and with the longitudinal axis at a substantial angle with respect
to the surface of the ocean. Company management personnel did not adequately supervise the BE
1900 flight training program to ensure that training objectives were
met without exposing its pilots to conditions potentially hazardous to
flight safety. The FAA failed to adequately monitor the company’s flight training
programs and faiied to recognize that management&#x27;s oversight of and
involvement in the BE 1900 training program were minimal. 10. PROBABLE CAUSE

The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable
causes of this accident were the instructor pilot’s loss of altitude awareness and
possible spatial disorientation, which resulted in the loss of control of the airpiane
at an altitude too low for recovery; and company management’s lack of
involvement in and oversight of its Beechcraft 1900 flight training program. Contributing to the accident was the instructor pilot’s exercise of poor judgment
in éstavlishing a flight situation and airplane configuration conducive to spatial
disorientation that afforded the pilots little or no margin for error. 11. SAFETY RECOMMENDATIONS

As the resutt of the investigation of this accident, the National
Transportation Safety Board recommends that the Federal Aviation Administration:

Require principal operations inspectors of commuter
airlines to verify that appropriate and qualified levels of
airline management are actively involved in the airline’s
flight training programs. (Class II, Priority Action)
(A-93-70)

29

Encourage commuter airline managers to use approved
flight simulators for pilot training, qualiftcation, and
competency and instrument check purposes to the
maximum extent feasible. (Class II, Priority Action)
(A-93-71)

Consider an amendment to 14 CFR Part 135 to require
that commuter air carriers perform certain hazardous
training, testing, and checking maneuvers, such as
engine-out operations and recovery from unusual flight
attitudes, in approved flight simulators to the maximum
extent feasible. (Class IH, Longer Term Action)
(A-93-72)

The Safety Board also recommends that the Regional Airline Association:
Encourage its members to use approved flight simulators
for required pilot training, qualification, and competency ©
and instrument check purposes to the maximum extent
feasible. (Class II, Priority Action) (A-93-73)

further increased by the limited support he received from ATC, which included 
unresponsiveness, inefficient clearances to ADW, and an inability to provide a requested ASR 
approach. The NTSB therefore concludes that the pilot‘s workload increased substantially and 
unexpectedly as a result of encountering instrument weather conditions. NTSB 
Aircraft Accident Report 
55 
Further, the NTSB concludes that the pilot‘s expectation that he could descend below the 
cloud ceiling at an altitude above the MDA for the approach, his familiarity with ADW, and the 
reduction in workload a return to visual conditions would have provided are all factors that may 
have encouraged the pilot to deviate below the glideslope and attempt to ―duck under‖ the cloud 
ceiling. Regardless of the pilot‘s expectations for reaching VMC, once he deviated below the 
glideslope, he should have been prepared to level off at the MDA prescribed by the instrument 
approach procedure until he was able to confirm the airport environment as required by federal 
regulations. The pilot‘s failure to stop or slow the descent indicates that he was not aware of the 
helicopter‘s excessive descent rate or its height above the terrain, likely because he was looking 
outside the cockpit for the ground. At night, with low cloud ceilings, reduced visibility, and no 
surface light references, there were insufficient visual cues available for the pilot to establish 
ground reference. The helicopter was equipped with a radar altimeter, which should have alerted the pilot 
when he descended below 300 feet agl, about 6 seconds before impact with the trees.72 However, 
there was no decrease in the helicopter‘s descent rate after it passed through 300 feet agl. Testing 
of the radar altimeter revealed no discrepancies that would have prevented it from functioning 
normally during the accident flight. The NTSB concludes that the pilot failed to adhere to 
instrument approach procedures when he did not arrest the helicopter‘s descent at the MDA. The 
NTSB further concludes that although descent rate and altitude information were readily 
available through cockpit instruments, the pilot failed to monitor the instruments likely because 
he was preoccupied with looking for the ground, which he could not identify before impact due 
to the lack of external visual cues. Additionally, NTSB investigators asked a manufacturer of TAWS to determine what pilot 
alerts would be expected if the helicopter had been equipped with TAWS. The manufacturer 
ascertained that three aural terrain alerts would have been generated at 7, 4, and 2 seconds prior 
to tree impact, and an aural glideslope alert would have been generated 24 seconds prior to tree 
impact if a valid glideslope signal was being received. It is unlikely the glideslope warning 
would have caused the pilot to arrest his descent since it appears that he intentionally deviated 
from the glideslope. However, if the helicopter had been equipped with a TAWS, the aural 
terrain alerts of ―Caution Terrain,‖ ―Warning Terrain,‖ and ―Pull-up,‖ would have been 
provided.</div>

caused one or more of the capacitors fin the CAM monitoring unit to become sufficiently charged to back bias at least one of the transistors
in the preamplifier circuit. If this had occurred, the microphone
amplifier would have ceased operation until the excess charge dissipated. When the charge had dissipated, testing would nov have revealed the
probiem. Other than the CVR malfunction, there was no evidence of any other
malfunction caused by lighting in the aircraft&#x27;s electrical circuits,
including those circuits which involve the navigation and communication
systams. Although the pilots were unable to recat] lightning strikes
near the cockpit, it is possible that lightning might have had an adverse
effect on the pilots. If lightning had struck near the cockpit, the
pilots couid have been temporarily blinded for 10 to 20 seconds--a
sufficient amount of time for a pilot to lose control of an aircraft on
final approach,

The iow barometric settings on the pilot&#x27;s altimeters would have
caused the altimeters to indicate an altitude tower than the actual
altitude of the aircraft,

The condition of the captain&#x27;s altimeter when it was recovered
and the results of subsequent tests suggest that it might have indicated

ubout 500 feet too high at the OM altitude if the compensating pin behind
the balance assembly support had been out of position,

Howaver, during vibration tests, the pin could not be removed, which
indicates that the pin was probably displaced by impact,

Although the first officer made a number of references to altitude
during the approach, the flightcrew did not mantion a difference in
altitude indications between the two altimeters. &lt;A difference of 500 feet
would have been detected and challenged. Finally, no record of altimeter
malfunction appeared on the aircraft flight logs. Therefore, altimeter
error was not a factor in the accident. The captain&#x27;s flight director system was believed to be functioning
properly until the case of the flight director instrument was dented, which
locked the command bars in a pitch-down display, The aircraft was ina
nosehigh attitude about midway through the crash sequence. This conclusion
ig supported by the captain&#x27;s recollections and the impact damage to the
sycamore tree. Consequently, it is possible chat the attitude was near
oo° , whict. caused the command bars to disulay a pitch-down indication
of about 10° .

The flight was routine until it approached the St. Louis terminal
area. At that time, the flightcrew was aware that thunderstorms which
existed near the airport might block the flight&#x27;s approach,

After receiving information &quot;Quebec&quot; on th ATIS, the flightcrew would
have expected to receive radar vectors for an ILS approach to runway 12R.</div>

loss of control,

Although the pilot could, urder relatively favorable conditions,
modulate his control inputs to maintain a steady flightpath, the attention
and workload required tu do so might be compromised by the performance
of other necessary flight duties in an IFR environment. Any slight
inattention to aircraft control would quickly precipitate aircraft
divergence, which would increase at a rapid rate «8 airspeed reduced. For a c.g, position of 141.20 ins., the time to double the pitch
divergence amplitude according to Calspan Corporation flight tests, is
about 2 secs. In this accident since the maneuvering stick force gradient
was zero, overcontrol of the aircraft or a pilot induced oscillation
would have resulted following a divergence since the pilot would have
found it difficult to avoid unwanted inpute. ConsequentJy, the orobability of recovery after the divergence was recognized would have beer
problematical. The pilot probably was not able to trim the aircraft in
the short time following takeoff. He may have merely modulated the
divergence of the aircraft for a brief time before matters became
uncontrollable by periodically pushing and pulling on the control wheel
in an attempt to set pitch attitude. On this takeoff, the flightcrew of N631PT probably ignored
the misloading of their aircraft. Although they may have been aware
that certain degraded flight characteristics should be expected from
an extreme aft c.g., the sudden departure from normal aircraft performance
would have, in this case, caught them unaware. The extra workload imposed
by the instrument meteorological concitions with no visible herizon, both
pilots&#x27; low experience level in this aircraft, and a turn shortly after
takeoff would have added to the confusion caused by the aircraft&#x27;s erratic
deviations from expected standerd climb characteristics. Tho Safety
Board concludes that, because of the confusion brought about by these

conditions, the pilots 2i1isved the aircraft to diverge from the normal
departure profile and she. overcoatrolled the aircraft into an unsafe
condition during recovery attempts. This overcontrol then increased in
amplitud: uncil the aircraft crashed. Transport Pilot Certificate, and was a qualified flight instructor, they

and their training at the Piper Aircraft Company, both pilots should
have been qualified to ure the PA-31T visual plotter. Therefore, they
should have known that N631PT was out-of-balance and should have either
cancelled the flight or redistributed the load to bring the aircraft

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] Therefore, because the airspeed display on the J-4100 was
consistent with these principles, the Safety Board does not consider their format or
mode of presentation to be a factor in this accident. Nevertheless, the circumstances of this flight should not have been
especially anxiety provoking. Nighttime flight in icing IMC conditions, although not
routine, were not beyond the ability expected of air transport pilots. However, in
this accident, the evidence indicates that the captain&#x27;s own failure to stabilize the
airplane on final approach, in accordance with the flight profile suggested in the
ACA MOM, likely created the circumstances that exacerbated the anxiety he was
experiencing. Thus, when the airplane was established on the localizer, and its
airspeed and configuration were still not stabilized, the evidence indicates that the
captain was overwhelmed by a need tu perform certain actions simultaneously. These included the need to:

slow the airplane down and establish the proper airspeed,

maintain a precise flightpath in the restricted visual conditions,

maintain a vigilance for ice accretion, and
) closely observe the first officer as well as manage his actions. The evidence indicates that the captain was unable to perform these
actions when required. Further, his use of the autopilot to help with one of the
required actions, maintaining a precise flightpath, suggests an unfamiliarity with its
capabilities. This suggestion is supported by the captain&#x27;s reported consistent use of
the autopilot when flying instrument approach profiles. Given the deficiencies in his
execution of instrument approaches, as documented in his check rides with ACA,
the captain appears to have demonstrated, especially when nervous, a weak
instrument scan in high performance aircraft during restricted visual conditions. A pilot with a poor scan could rely on the autopilot to fly a precision
instrument approach, with the knowledge that the system should reliably and
accurately execute both the glideslope and localizer flightpaths. However, use of
the autopilot, without compensating efforts to thoroughly monitor necessary airplane
instruments, could exacerbate a possible poor instrument scan, since no effort ts

62

needed to relate the airplane&#x27;s flightpath to corrections to the contro! surfaces
necessary to maintain the proper flightpath. The evidence suggests that this
captain&#x27;s use of the autopilot exacerbated a tendency to a deficient instrument scan. That is, his performance on the accident flight, and reports of his use of autopilot
during the execution of instrument approaches, indicated that he relied on the
autopilot to maintain a stabilized flightpath without concomitant monitoring of the
critical airplane parameter of airspeed, a parameter not controlled by the autopilot. It is possible that both pilots, given their relative inexperience in the J4100, were not sufficiently experienced in the digital format in which airspeed was
presented to provide them with the necessary ability to anticipate critical trends in
the airspeed. Because both had considerably more experience piloting aircraft with
traditional electromechanical instrumentation than with aircraft with “glass cockpit”
type digital presentation of flight information, the Safety Board could not rule out
their relative inexperience with electronic flight instrumentation as a potentially
adverse influence on their performance on the night of the accident.</div>

and FDR data show that the accident airplane was only about 300 feet above the
ground when the stick pusher activated. A successful recovery after stick pusher
activation at night and so close to the ground would have been difficult, although
flight testing conducted at safe altitudes show that it was not impossible. From a
human performance standpoint, it would have been very difficult to maintain a nose-

down pitch attitude at night when the airplane was so close to the ground. In that
regard, the captain&#x27;s overriding of the stick pusher at that point, although ill-advised,
is urderstandable. The Safety Board attempted to determine the manner in which two air
carrier pilots committed the fundamental errors that led to the accident. These
include the: 1) failure to monitor airspeed, 2) misinterpretation of pronounced and
unambiguous cues of an imminent stall, and 3) improper stall recovery. The evidence suggests that each crewmember possessed unique
deficiencies that affected his performance during the flight. The Safety Board
believes that these deficiencies, alone or in combination, likely contributed to the
errors noted. These include the captain&#x27;s:

o documented history of poor execution of precision instrument
approaches,

inexperience in nighttime, icing and restricted visibility
conditions in the J-4100,

inexperience with autopilot coupled approaches, and
0 inexperience as a PIC. The first officer, who was considered an above average pilot,
nevertheless, was:

inexperienced as a first officer in schedule 14 CFR Part 135
operations, and

ry inexperienced in the J-4100. The captain was concemed before departure about the weather
conditions en route and in the vicinity of Columbus. Evidence obtained by the
Safety Board indicates that he had not flown either as PIC for ACA or as a
crewmember on the J-4100 in the unique meteorological conditions present at the
time of the accident (darkness, low ceiling and visibility, fog, freezing temperatures,
and frozen precipitation). Further, according to the CVR during the execution of the
approach, the captain manifested apprehension about the performance of the first

59

officer. Perhaps it was these concerns that led ‘o the tension illustrated by the minor
incidents recorded on the CVR. For example, at 2309:06, the captain accused the
first officer of giving him incorrect altimeter information. At 2309:44, the captain
vacillated on whether to direct the first officer to obtain Vye¢ with or without AOA
speeds for the approach. At 2312:29, the first officer misinterpreted the purpose of

about 230 feet of altitude and with the airspeed down to
about 105 KIAS, the captain called for the application
of full available power (971° or 4,000 h.p.). Thereafter the aircraft gained an additional 500 feet of
altitude and the airspeed decreased to the point where
control of the aircraft was lost. The aircraft impacted a hangar located approximately
100 feet southeast of the threshold and approximately
1,600 feet from the edge of Runway 14R. There was no evidence of any failure or malfunctici to
the aircraft structure, powerplants, or components
prior to impact. Sound spectrographic analysis of the CVR showed that no
power interruption to either engine occurred during the
approach up until time of impact. There was no atmospheric turbwence or wingtip vortex
encountered by Flight 458 during the later portion of

the approach which could have resulted in, ox contributed
to, the final clinbing departure from the ILS approach
path. Qualitative flight test of the CV-580 revealed no adverse
flight characteristics during the duplicated climb
maneuver including the stall buffet regime. Positive
aileron, rudder, and elevator control were available
throughout the maneuver. Comments made by the flightcrew during the latter stage
of the approach, as found on the CVR, indicate that
&quot;lights,&quot; either on the ground or from the eircraft,
were a factor which resulted in spatial disorientation
of the pilot and the subsequent loss of control of the
aircraft. (b) Probable Cause

The Safety Board determines that the probable cause of this
accident was spatial disorientation of the captain precipitated by
atmospheric refraction of either the approach lights or landing lights
al @ oritical point in the approach wherein the crew was transitioning
between rying by reference to flight instruments and by visual reference to the round. 3. RECOMMENDATIONS

_. In connection with this accident, the Safety Board recommends to
the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration that:

Section 121.652 of the Federal Aviation Regulations be amend:d
to prohibit a captain from being removed from &quot;high&quot; minimums
until he has accrued 100 hours as pilot-in-command in type snd
that 50 percent of this time may be reduced by 1 hour for one
landing that is made by conducting a published approach procedure. Actual or simulated IFR approaches accrued under Part
121 Training Program would be accepted for such substitution
cited. BY THE NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD:

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] After the FO began pushing forward on the control column and the airplane’s pitch dropped 
below the horizon, its vertical acceleration rapidly decreased. Due to this change and the airplane’s 
continued longitudinal acceleration, the resultant GIF vector sensed by the pilots swung 
dramatically aft. This likely exacerbated the FO’s pitch-up sensation and possibly produced a 
sensation of tumbling backward, known as the inversion illusion (Cheung 2004). The FO’s 
comments “oh” and “whoa,” which expressed surprise, likely reflected his experience of one or 
both phenomena. 
2.3.1.2 Other Factors Adversely Affecting Performance 
Surprising events in the cockpit increase task demands on a pilot to resolve them (Lazarus 
and Folkman 1984). These types of events can also cause acute stress, which involves perceiving 
an immediate danger, and can trigger a “fight or flight” response (FAA 2016, 17-12). The effects 
 
49 Rapid deceleration would have the opposite effect, as the pilot may mistakenly think that the airplane is in a 
nose-down attitude. 
50 Research using a centrifugal simulator has shown that the introduction of accelerations conducive to 
somatogravic illusion interfered with pilot scanning and interpretation of primary flight displays (Cheung and Hofer 
2003, 11-20).

NTSB 
Aircraft Accident Report

of both surprise and stress can increase a pilot’s perceived need to act while degrading the pilot’s 
ability to accurately assess what needs to be done; this can result in impulsive and incorrect actions 
due to a physiological reaction known as a “startle response” (Landman et al 2017, 1161-72). 
About the time the FO expressed surprise, he rapidly brought the control column to an 
almost neutral position, then pushed it forward again. This action could have constituted 
intentional testing behavior to see how relaxing forward pressure on the column affected sensations 
of motion, or it could have occurred reflexively as a result of a startle response. About this time, 
the combined effects of the changes in the airplane’s motion resulted in changes to the GIF vector 
similar to what would occur if the airplane were descending vertically in a near-level pitch attitude, 
which likely produced a sensation of falling. About this time, the FO exclaimed, “where’s my speed” and “we’re stalling,” and 
continued to push the control column forward, exacerbating the airplane’s dive. Although the FO 
declared that the airplane was stalling, the NTSB’s airplane performance study found that the 
airplane’s airspeed and wing AOA were not consistent with the airplane having been at or near a 
nose-high stalled condition. Further, the FO’s response to excessively lower the nose of the 
airplane was contrary to standard procedures and training for responding to a stall, which 
prescribed first assessing the readily identifiable cues indicative of the airplane approaching an 
impending stall and disconnecting the automation.</div>

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] Further, the FO’s response to excessively lower the nose of the 
airplane was contrary to standard procedures and training for responding to a stall, which 
prescribed first assessing the readily identifiable cues indicative of the airplane approaching an 
impending stall and disconnecting the automation. No such cues—such as stick shaker activation, 
stall warning annunciations, nose-high pitch indications (including those provided by the ADI’s 
airplane attitude presentation and pitch limit indicator), and low airspeed indications—were 
present. The NTSB’s investigation found no evidence that any of the sources of airspeed and 
airplane pitch information available to the FO were malfunctioning; thus, the FO’s comments 
about airspeed and stall indicate that he was not effectively scanning his instruments and 
interpreting the information they provided. The FO’s attention appears to have been fully absorbed 
by the incorrect sensations of pitching up and falling, which, for him, were the most compelling 
cues in his environment, leading him to incorrectly conclude that the airplane was stalling. This 
would have reinforced his perceived need to continue nose-down control inputs. The effects of sensory illusions, stress, and the startle response can adversely affect the 
performance of any pilot, and pilot training program and proficiency check requirements for 
Part 121 air carriers include emergency procedures scenarios intended to help a pilot develop and 
maintain the skills to appropriately assess and respond to a variety of stressful, startling scenarios. However, the accident FO had a history of training performance deficiencies in which he 
performed poorly in response to unexpected stressful events.51 Various instructors and check 
airmen from throughout the FO’s career described training scenarios in which the FO demonstrated 
low situational awareness, became overwhelmed, overcontrolled the airplane, made numerous 
mistakes, and responded impulsively with inappropriate actions.52 
 
51 Atlas was not aware of all the FO’s training performance deficiencies (see sections 2.4.1 and 2.4.2). 
52 Impulsivity has been identified as an undesirable hazardous attitude that can affect a pilot’s ability to make 
sound decisions. It is the perceived need to do something—anything—immediately. Pilots with impulsivity tend to 
act without thinking and do not select the best alternative (FAA 2008, 8-17).

NTSB 
Aircraft Accident Report 
43 
Based on the FO’s history of training performance deficiencies, the FO was susceptible to 
responding impulsively and inappropriately when faced with a stressful, unexpected event. Therefore, the NTSB concludes that, although compelling sensory illusions, stress, and startle 
response can adversely affect the performance of any pilot, the FO had fundamental weaknesses 
in his flying aptitude and stress response that further degraded his ability to accurately assess the 
airplane’s state and respond with appropriate procedures after the inadvertent activation of the goaround mode. 
2.3.2 Captain’s Delayed Awareness and Ineffective Response

and slightly increase pitch to level off at the MCP-selected altitude of 3,000 ft msl.</div>

                        <div class="chunk-text">[CONCLUSIONS &gt; FINDINGS] It is unlikely that the captain was deliberately attempting to perform a tailplane stall 
recovery. 
14. No evidence indicated that the Q400 was susceptible to a tailplane stall. 
15. Although the reasons the first officer retracted the flaps and suggested raising the gear could 
not be determined from the available information, these actions were inconsistent with 
company stall recovery procedures and training. 
16. The Q400 airspeed indicator lacked low-speed awareness features, such as an amber band 
above the low-speed cue or airspeed indications that changed to amber as speed decrease 
toward the low-speed cue, which would have facilitated the flight crew’s detection of the 
developing low-speed situation. 
17. An aural warning in advance of the stick shaker would have provided a redundant cue of the 
visual indication of the rising low-speed cue and might have elicited a timely response from 
the pilots before the onset of the stick shaker. 
18. The captain’s failure to effectively manage the flight (1) enabled conversation that delayed 
checklist completion and conflicted with sterile cockpit procedures and (2) created an 
environment that impeded timely error detection. 
19. The monitoring errors made by the accident flight crew demonstrate the continuing need for 
specific pilot training on active monitoring skills. 
20. Colgan Air’s standard operating procedures at the time of the accident did not promote 
effective monitoring behavior. 
21. Specific leadership training for upgrading captains would help standardize and reinforce the 
critical command authority skills needed by a pilot-in-command during air carrier operations. 
22. Because of the continuing number of accidents involving a breakdown of sterile cockpit 
discipline, collaborative action by the Federal Aviation Administration and the aviation 
industry to promptly address this issue is warranted. 
23. The flight crewmembers’ performance during the flight, including the captain’s deviations 
from standard operating procedures and the first officer’s failure to challenge these 
deviations, was not consistent with the crew resource management (CRM) training that they 
had received or the concepts in the Federal Aviation Administration’s CRM guidance. NTSB 
Aircraft Accident Report 
24. The pilots’ performance was likely impaired because of fatigue, but the extent of their 
impairment and the degree to which it contributed to the performance deficiencies that 
occurred during the flight cannot be conclusively determined. 
25. All pilots, including those who commute to their home base of operations, have a personal 
responsibility to wisely manage their off-duty time and effectively use available rest periods 
so that they can arrive for work fit for duty; the accident pilots did not do so by using an 
inappropriate facility during their last rest period before the accident flight. 
26. Colgan Air did not proactively address the pilot fatigue hazards associated with operations at 
a predominantly commuter base. 
27. Operators have a responsibility to identify risks associated with commuting, implement 
strategies to mitigate these risks, and ensure that their commuting pilots are fit for duty. 
28. The first officer’s illness symptoms did not likely affect her performance directly during the 
flight. 
29. The captain had not established a good foundation of attitude instrument flying skills early in 
his career, and his continued weaknesses in basic aircraft control and instrument flying were 
not identified and adequately addressed.

was attempting to provide support to the captain because raising the gear is one of the steps in 
the stall recovery procedure, but the “gear up” callout was the responsibility of the flying pilot, 
and the steps that preceded that callout had not been accomplished. The NTSB concludes that, although the reasons the first officer retracted the flaps and 
suggested raising the gear could not be determined from the available information, these actions 
were inconsistent with company stall recovery procedures and training. 
2.2.4 
Captain’s Management of Flight 
The captain was responsible for the management of the flight. However, he and the first 
officer engaged in conversations for much of the flight,209 starting about 6 minutes 40 seconds 
after takeoff as the airplane was climbing to 12,000 feet during the ascent to its cruise altitude. 
(The airplane had reached an altitude of 10,000 feet about 2 minutes before the conversations 
began.) Although the conversations during cruise flight did not conflict with Federal regulations 
or company policy, their depth and duration likely contributed to the delayed performance of 
callouts and checklists.210 For example, Colgan’s Q400 CFM indicated that the cruise checklist 
should be performed after the airplane attained its assigned cruising altitude,211 as the flying 
pilot leveled the airplane and allowed it to accelerate to the maximum operating limit speed 
minus 10 knots. However, the captain called for the cruise checklist about 2138:47, which was 
about 2.5 minutes after the airplane had accelerated to cruise speed. The airplane began descending from its 16,000-foot cruise altitude about 2157:20. Although Colgan’s Flight Operations Policies and Procedures Manual stated that approach 
briefings should generally be accomplished before the top of the descent (when the crew’s 
workload was expected to be minimal), the captain did not start this briefing until 2204:16, as the 
airplane descended below 12,000 feet.212 The manual also required a callout by the flying pilot 
when the airplane was descending through 10,000 feet, but the captain was conducting the 
approach briefing at that time and omitted the callout. 
 
208 The asterisk denotes an unintelligible word. 
209 Between the time that the airplane left the gate at EWR and the time that it was cleared for takeoff, 1 hour 
33 minutes had elapsed. During the ground time at EWR that was captured by the CVR, the flight crew engaged in 
lengthy conversations that were not directly related to the operation, which set the tone for the flight. 
210 The captain was also late with a checklist callout earlier in the flight. Colgan’s Q400 CFM indicated that the 
taxi checklist should begin after an airplane leaves the ramp area.</div>

vectors and clearances given to the flight, especially the clearance to
MDA, the captain should have realized that his aircraft was at, or about
to pass, the FAF. The evidence indicated that he was reluctant to Jower
the gear until he was estabiished on the final approach heading. Because of this delay, the landing flaps were not extended. Both of these delays increased the captain&#x27;s workload during the descent
and contributed to producing the major causal area of the accident---a
lack of altitude awareness. The delay in extending the landing gear and
the resultant delay in beginning the before-landing final checklist also
contributed in part to the first officer&#x27;s failure to previde the captain
with some of his required altitude callouts. Except for monitoring, crosschecking, and calling abnormal
conditions to the captain&#x27;s attention &quot;in the lower altitude portions of
an instrument approach,&quot; no specific altitude awareness responsibilities
were assigned to the flight engineer. The evidence showed that he was
busy with his assigned checklist duties after the aircraft descended
through 1,000 ft. The captain called for “gear down&quot; at 940 ft and for
the before-landing finri checklist 1 to 2 sec later. Since the first
four items on the checklist were accomplished by the flight engineer and
since he challenged the first officer with the fifth iten, &quot;landing gear
and lever,&quot; 10 sec later, he obviously was involved in accomplishing the
checklist. The GPWS alert sounded about 3 sec after the first officer
responded to the &quot;landing gear and lever&quot; checklist challenge.

“with regard to the first officer, the evidence disclosed that
either he did not leok at his altimeter or he did not perceive what he
saw until the aircraft was at 100 ft. At this point, the aircraft was
descending at 20 fps. Although he claimed he thought the altimeter read
1,100 ft, he was abie to resolve the error quickly since he made a 50-ft
callout. The evidence also indicated that, except for resetting the
altitude alerter and extending the landing gear, the first officer&#x27;s
attention was directed outside the cockpit until he was required to
respond to the flight engineer’s checklist challenge, &quot;landing gear and
lever.&quot;

Since the controls of the altitude alerter are located on ‘top
of the instrument p-nel&#x27;s glare shield, its use requires that the crewmember&#x27;s attention be ci:ected away from the flight instruments while he
is manipulating the controls. According to the first. officer and captain,
the alerter was reset to the new missed approach altitude of 2,000 ft
after the aireraft left 1,300 ft. A full 2-sec. altit.ide alert sounded
as the aircraft passed through 700 ft, the height which would approxinate

the upper aural warning altitude had tne system been set to the MDA. Since the first officer and captain denied that it was set to the MDA,
it is possible that the signal was spurizus; its cause could not be
determined by the evidence. The first officer&#x27;s duties also require him to seek ground

Federal regulations and approved procedures. There is no evidence that mechanical
malfunctions or failures of the airplane structures, flight control systems, or powerplants
contributed to the accident. The evidence indicates that the airplane’s hydraulic system was not configured for
landing. Because the hydraulic system remained in the low pressure mode, hydraulic pressure
was not available to lower the landing gear and deploy the flaps. The flightcrew failed to detect
this configuration error and continued its approach into Houston. Comments on the CVR and
postaccident statements by the flightcrew indicate that both pilots recognized that the flaps did
not deploy after the flaps were selected to 15o, but the flightcrew did not determine the cause of
this problem or execute a go-around. The landing checklist was not performed, and the flightcrew did not confirm that
the gear was down and locked. The gear warning horn sounded during the approach, indicating
that the landing gear was not extended, but it was ignored. When the airplane descended through
500 feet AFE, it was traveling 84 knots faster than the target airspeed of 132 knots. Although,
under COA standard operating procedures, this excessive airspeed mandated that the approach be
discontinued, the captain rejected a go-around request from the first officer, who was the flying
pilot. The GPWS sounded an alert 19 seconds before impact and was ignored. Unaware that the
gear was not down, the captain assumed control of the airplane and made a wheels-up landing. This analysis addresses flightcrew performance, including the role of fatigue in
the flightcrew’s performance, the adequacy of COA’s oversight of its pilots and the FAA’s
oversight of COA, checklist design, and survival factors.

2.2
Flightcrew Performance
Performance deficiencies exhibited by the flightcrew during this flight include: (1)
failure to configure the hydraulic system for landing during the performance of the in-range
checklist; (2) failure to detect initially that the flaps did not extend; (3) failure to determine the
reason the flaps did not extend after detection; (4) failure to perform the landing checklist and to
confirm the landing gear status; and (5) failure to discontinue the approach.
2.2.1
Failure to Properly Complete the In-range Checklist
Fifteen minutes before landing, as the airplane descended through 19,000 feet, the
captain omitted one item on the in-range checklist. The omitted item, “Hydraulics - ON &amp; HI,
CHECKED,” would have enabled the high pressure configuration of the hydraulic system,
thereby providing pressure to operate the flaps and landing gear. Three steps were required to
complete this checklist item: movement of the AUX and ALT pump switches from “OFF” to
“ON,” movement of the left and right engine-driven hydraulic pump switches from “LOW” to
“HI,” and confirmation that system pressures were between 2,800 and 3,100 psi.</div>

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] However, even if the pilot thought that they were properly tuned to 
the CTAF, it would not have been reasonable or prudent for him to assume that the absence of 
any transmissions would mean that no traffic was in the area because that absence would not 
preclude the presence of non-radio-equipped aircraft in the area. The King Air pilot&#x27;s flying history suggests that he may not have placed sufficient 
importance on the basics of safe flying. His previous gear-up incident during an instructional 
flight suggests carelessness, and his subsequent comments to the FAA indicate that he did not 
consider the incident significant. The fact that he sat on an active runway for an extended time 
and comments from students indicating that he seemed to be rushing them are consistent with a 
careless attitude. Further, during his last year as a TWA pilot, the pilot had been downgraded 
from captain to flight engineer because of poor performance during recurrent training. The accident occurred at 1701, a time often associated with fatigue. According to 
the pilot&#x27;s wife, he slept normally in the days before the accident but awoke earlier than his usual 
time of 0800 on the day of the accident. The detection of lorazepam in the pilot&#x27;s urine indicates 
that he ingested the medication in the previous days or weeks. However, the absence of the 
medication in his blood indicates that he was not impaired by the medication at the time of the 
accident. Nevertheless, his potentially recent use of the medication suggests that he may have 
had some difficulty sleeping. Based on his early wake-up time, the time of day that the accident 
occurred, and the possibility that he had difficulty sleeping recently, he was most likely not at his 
peak alertness at the time of the accident. However, the Safety Board could not determine the 
extent to which this may have affected his performance. The King Air pilot might have been in a hurry to get home after a long day of 
flying potential purchasers of the King Air on a demonstration flight to Tulsa. After the King Air 
pilot returned to Quincy, two of the passengers said that he seemed to be &quot;ii:i a hurry&quot; or &quot;anxious 
to get home.&quot; 
A combination of these factors (preoccupation with providing instruction to the 
pilot/passenger, careless habits, possible fatigue, and rushing) could explain why the King Air 
pilot did not properly scan for traffic. The pilot/passenger was a ground instructor with Flight Safety International and 
had instructed commuter pilots on proper procedures at uncontrolled airports. She would have 
known the importance of scanning for traffic before taking off. The fact that she did not do so in 
this case suggests that she may have been preoccupied with the instruction, focusing solely on the 
cockpit instruments, and she may have assumed that the pilot had already scanned for traffic 
before taking off.

                        <div class="chunk-text">[CONCLUSIONS &gt; FINDINGS] Had the captain complied with standard operating procedures in response to the flap 
anomaly, unstabilized approach, stick shaker, and terrain awareness and warning system 
warning and initiated a go-around maneuver, the accident likely would not have occurred. 
11. The first officer’s failure to maintain airspeed while acting as the pilot flying likely resulted 
from being distracted by the flap anomaly, the captain’s actions in response to it, and the 
control force inputs needed to maintain aircraft control. 
12. The captain’s failure to call out the first officer’s airspeed deviations resulted directly from 
his preoccupation with performing an inappropriate, nonstandard procedure in response to 
the flap anomaly. 
13. Although some of the airspeed bugs (including the internal bug) were not set to the 
appropriate approach airspeeds and were not reset following recognition of the flap anomaly, 
the flight crew had a sufficient reference to maintain the minimum safe airspeed because the 
airspeed for a no-flap approach in icing conditions was correctly briefed as 143 knots, and 
the red airspeed bugs were set near that value. 
14. Reliance upon flight crew vigilance and stall warning systems may be inadequate to prevent 
hazardous low-airspeed situations, and, had a low-airspeed alerting system been installed on 
the airplane, it may have directed the flight crew’s attention to the decaying airspeed earlier 
and provided an opportunity to take corrective action before the stall protection system 
activated. 
15. The first officer’s failure to assert herself to the captain and initiate a go-around maneuver 
when she recognized the unstabilized approach likely resulted from the steep authority 
gradient in the cockpit and the first officer’s minimal training on assertiveness; further, the 
captain’s quick dismissal of the first officer’s go-around inquiry likely discouraged the first 
officer from voicing her continued concerns and challenging the captain’s decision to 
continue the unstabilized approach. 
16. Role-playing exercises are essential for effective assertiveness training because such 
exercises provide flight crews with opportunities for targeted practice of specific behaviors 
and feedback that a lecture-based presentation format lacks. 
17. The establishment of best practices for conducting both single and multiple emergency and 
abnormal situations training needs to include training for the occurrence of these situations at 
low altitudes because low-altitude scenarios require rapid, accurate assessment of abnormal 
situations and appropriate prioritization of tasks. 
18. Although the risk for fatigue existed at the time of the accident due to the window of 
circadian low, the first officer took steps to mitigate the effects of fatigue, and her errors 
during the flight can be explained by her lack of experience in both the airplane and in icing 
conditions along with the distraction caused by the captain’s non-standard response to the 
flap anomaly. 
19. Due to the early morning hour of the accident flight and cumulative sleep debt, it is likely 
that fatigue degraded the captain’s performance.

in the takeoff position. Loss of power becaure of throttle mismanagement ie aleo a possible
contributing factor, Unintentional seduction of power to the extent that
flight could not be maintained could have resulted from incapacitation of
the flight engineer. Power reduction could also occur subtly if the
crewmembers failed to monitor the throttle friction tock. A factor that could have caused the crewmenbers&#x27; attention to be misdirected was the necessity to override the landing gear safaty solenoid
manually in order to retract the gear. This operation required two hands,
since the gear handle is on the aft, lower part of the center pedestal,
and the solenoid is recessed inside a hole on the lower right side of tha
center pedestal. An inexperienced and unqualified first officer might
have needed assistance tu retract the gear. Witnesses reported that the landing gear was raised late in tha takeoff and the landing gear was found in the full &quot;up&quot; position in the wreckage, The flight enginear would have had difficulty reaching either the
gear handle or the solenoid. Therefore, the captain or the first officer
could have been occupied raising the tanding gear during the critical
initial portion of the flighc. This fact, coupled with the loose throttle
friction, may have set the etege for the throttles to creep back during
the takeoff. In each of the preceding situations, the captain&#x27;s unexplainable
high COHb Level, the physiological condition of the flight engineer, and
the dnexperience of the first officer may have comp&#x27;icated events at a
critical time and, theri fore, contributed to the accident. 2.2 Conclusions

a. Findings

1. The aircraft was certificated and maintained in accordance
with 14 CFR 91; however, there were some discrepancies that
had not been corrected. There was no evidence of preimpact structural or flight control failure, fire, or powerplant failure. The captain and the first officer were certificated properly;
however, only the captain was qualified for the flight. The first officer did not meet the requirements of
14 CFR 91.213. The flight engineer lacked recency of experience as required
by 14 CFR 91.211 and was not medically qualified for the
flight,

The captain&#x27;s blood contained eufficient COHb to have adversely influenced his vision, coordination, and judznent,

The flight engineer&#x27;s blood contained sufficient meprobamate
to have caused detrimental effects on his performance,

The landing gear safety solenoid had to be depressed manually in order to raise the gear handle, and the throttle
friction lock on the pilot&#x27;s quadrant and at the flight
engineer&#x27;s station would not secure the throttles adequately.</div>

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] With the No. 3 engine inoperative, the
gear down, and the flaps excended, the aircraft&#x27;s abi}}ity to out clinb
the rising terrain was marginal, and it&#x27;s ability to accelerate to
higher airpseeds while outciimbing the terrain was nil. Aftar the
landing gear was fully retracted, the aircraft could have continued to
climb clear of terrain while accelerating with the flapa in the takeoff
position. However, the extreme nose-high attitude and the cessation of
climb indicates that the crew acted to retract the flaps befora the
aircraft was allowed to accelerate. As the flaps were retracting, the
aircraft&#x27;s climb capability, even at a constent airspeed, wes reduced. Furthermore, the change in aerodynamic forces as the flaps retracted
would have caused the aircraft to pitch to a higher roseup attitude
unless the crew exerted forward pressure on the control colum.. Under
the critical situstica confronting them, the Safety Board believes that
the crew would have been reluctant to push the nose down, In any event,
the loss cf only a few knots of airspeed was sufficient to place the
aircraft in s position from which recovery was not possible. Although the captain had taken off successfully with the
engine problem, le should have been prepared to abort the takeoff und
ther, to have taken that action when the propeller feathering sequence
started,

Since he knew that Air Manila had no maintenance facility or
spare parts at Guam to currect any major engire difficulty, tue Safety
Board believes that the captain con’inued the takeoff with t!:. intention
of analyzing the problem after the aircraft was airborne and, if there
was any way le could get the No. 3 engine to operate, continue to his
destination. If the engine could not be restarted, he had the option to
return and land. The Safety Board believes that the captain&#x27;s failure to abort
the takeoff immediately after the propeller feathering sequence was
initiated, exposed the aircraft and its passengers to a hazardous situation
that the company policy and good operating practices have been designed
to prevent. There was adequate runway remaining to have stopped the
aircraft by utilizing only the two outboard engines for symmetric reverse
and the aircraft&#x27;s normal braking system. 3. CONCLUSIONS Findings

1. The flightcrew membore were certificated and qualified in
accordance with the Republic of the Philippines
regulations and requirements.

The aircraft was originally certificated and registered
by the United States Prderal Aviarion Administration
and recertificated and reregistered under the Repubiic
of the Philippines regulations. The airwotthiness of the aircraft could not be determined. The aircraft&#x27;s transponder, o required item, was known
to be inoperable before the flight departed Manila and
had not been repaired. The aircraft&#x27;s fuel load was a mixture of JP-4 and Jet A
kerosene. This mixture ha» a low flashpoint -- about
30°F -- end a hazardous fire propagation characteristic. This accident was partially survivable. Twenty-eight
occupants of the aircraft survived tne impact loads
but were unable to escape or be rescued because of the

the briefer adhered to agency guidelines and provided a comprehensive weather

pilot in command was provided with a satisfactory weather briefing prior to
departing Cheyenne. Although the pilot in command stated that he was unable to access the
most recent ATIS broadcast on his radio, this was not a factor in the accident
because he received all significant weather information from the tower controller
and the AFSS weather briefer.

2.2
Analysis of the Accident Sequence
2.2.1
Operation of the Airplane’s Controls
Autopsy findings of multiple wrist, ankle and feet fractures to the
pilot in command indicate that he was handling the flight controls at the time of
impact, and the absence of such injuries to the pilot trainee suggests that she was
not handling the flight controls at the time of impact. It is unknown whether the pilot in command assumed control of the
airplane just prior to the impact, or whether he was flying during the entire takeoff
and accident sequence. The portrayal of the trip as an attempt to break the
transcontinental trip record by the youngest “pilot” suggests that the pilot trainee
would be doing the flying herself. Consistent with this portrayal, she was seated
in the left seat in front of the flight and navigation instruments, which is the seat
generally occupied by the person who is operating the controls. However, it is
known that the pilot trainee had not, in fact, done all of the flying herself on the
first day of the flight.39 Further, strong crosswinds, moderate turbulence, and
gusty winds existed at the time of the takeoff. As indicated by the control
difficulties experienced by the Cessna 414 pilot, who took off just before the
accident flight, the weather conditions at the time the airplane took off were
challenging even for experienced pilots, and it is unlikely that the pilot trainee
could have handled them without some assistance. Therefore, the Safety Board concludes that the pilot in command was
at least assisting the pilot trainee (if he was not the sole manipulator of the
controls) during the takeoff and climb-out sequence, and, at the time of impact, the
pilot in command was the sole manipulator of the airplane’s controls.
2.2.2
The Accident Scenario
The statements provided by witnesses indicated that the airplane’s
climb rate and speed were slow and that after the airplane transitioned to an
easterly heading, it rapidly rolled off on a wing and descended steeply to the
ground in a near vertical flightpath, consistent with a stall. The Safety Board

trainee had slept for part of the trip, and that the pilot in command had assisted her in one of the
landings because of strong winds.

its climb speed to the point at which it stalled.</div>

3. Conclusions 3.1 Findings 
1. The flight crew was properly certificated and qualified in accordance with federal 
regulations and company requirements. No evidence was found indicating that the flight 
crew’s performance was affected by toxins, alcohol or other drugs, or medical conditions. 
2. Postaccident examination of the airplane found no evidence of any preimpact structural, 
engine, or system failures. 
3. The air traffic controller’s handling of the flight was not a factor in this accident. 
4. As a result of the flight crew’s failure to complete the approach briefing and the Approach 
checklist as per standard operating procedures, the captain and first officer did not have a 
shared understanding of how the approach was to be conducted. 
5. Before the airplane reached the final approach fix, when the first officer reduced airspeed 
and placed the airplane in danger of encountering a stall, the captain should have taken 
control of the airplane or called for a missed approach, but he did not do so. 
6. When the airplane reached the minimum descent altitude, the approach was not stabilized, 
and the captain should have called for a missed approach according to standard operating 
procedures, but he did not do so. 
7. When attempting to arrest the airplane’s descent, the first officer did not appropriately 
manage pitch and thrust control inputs to counter the increased drag from the 45° flap 
setting, which resulted in an aerodynamic stall. 
8. The captain’s failure to enforce adherence to standard operating procedures and his 
mismanagement of the approach placed the airplane in an unsafe situation that ultimately 
resulted in the loss of control. 
9. The impact forces of the accident were survivable for some occupants, but the immediate 
and rapidly spreading postcrash fire likely precluded the possibility of escape. 
10. Operational flight data monitoring programs could provide 14 Code of Federal Regulations 
Part 135 operators with objective information regarding the manner in which their pilots 
conduct flights, and a periodic review of such information could assist operators in 
detecting and correcting unsafe deviations from company standard operating procedures. 
11. Because Execuflight did not fully evaluate the information it had concerning the first 
officer’s significant training difficulties at his previous employer, the company missed an 
opportunity to determine if the first officer was fully capable of operating its airplanes 
safely. NTSB 
Aircraft Accident Report

12. The flight crew did not demonstrate effective crew resource management during the 
accident flight. 
13. Deficiencies in Execuflight’s crew resource management (CRM) training program, 
including the cursory review of CRM topics, the lack of appropriate evaluation of CRM 
examinations, and the lack of continual reinforcement of CRM principles, resulted in the 
flight crew receiving inadequate CRM training.

failed to notice, and the airplane remained level at 3,000 ft msl. As the first officer continued to slow the airplane, the captain made several comments about 
the airplane’s decaying speed. At 1449.41.3, the captain said “look you’re going one twenty. you 
can’t keep decreasing your speed**--.” The first officer was apparently unaware of his speed 
because he responded “no. one tw--. how do you get one twenty?” The first officer may have 
believed that he was allowed to slow to VREF or 124 knots, but, at that moment, the airplane was 
still at flaps 25°, and according to Execuflight SOPs, should have been flying no slower than 
VREF + 20 knots or 144 knots. The first officer’s speed reduction placed the airplane in danger of 
an aerodynamic stall if the speed continued to decay, but the first officer apparently did not realize

it.54 At 1449:56.1, the captain said “that’s what I’m saying. if you keep decreasing your speed--,” 
the first officer interrupted “but why?” and the captain continued “because we gonna stall. I don’t 
want to sta--.” The first officer’s lack of awareness of his configuration and speed should have 
been an indication to the captain that the first officer was having difficulty flying the airplane in 
IMC and was not sufficiently familiar with the nonprecision approach procedures on the 
Hawker 700A to execute the approach safely. It was apparent that the first officer had lost 
situational awareness of the approach, and the circumstances were demanding more than his 
capabilities; however, the captain allowed the first officer to continue flying the approach. The 
NTSB concludes that before the airplane reached the FAF, when the first officer reduced airspeed 
and placed the airplane in danger of encountering a stall, the captain should have taken control of 
the airplane or called for a missed approach, but he did not do so. At 1450:21.6, the approach controller instructed the flight to change to the local advisory 
frequency. At 1450:39.8, the captain made a position report on the local advisory frequency, and 
at 1450:53.9, one of the pilots of the preceding slower airplane stated, “hey guys. ah we just landed 
on the loc. and uh broke out right at minimums (right at a) mile.” This voluntary pilot report 
indicated that the ceiling was near the MDA of 1,540 ft msl or 473 ft agl, and the visibility was 
possibly below the 1 1/4 mi visibility required for the approach. Since this visibility report was not 
an official observation, the accident flight was authorized to continue the approach.</div>

altitude. Because the airplane was high on the approach, it was out of position to use a normal 
descent rate of 1,000 fpm to the MDA. The airplane’s rate of descent increased rapidly, and at 1451:43, the airplane reached a 
descent rate of about 2,000 fpm, at an altitude of about 2,300 ft, and an airspeed of 118 knots. The 
high descent rate was likely due to the first officer’s attempt to salvage the approach by increasing 
the rate of descent, exacerbated by the increased drag resulting from the improper flaps 45° 
configuration. At 1451:56.6, the captain said, “on localizer. you’re diving. you’re diving. don’t 
dive. two thousand feet per minute buddy.” The first officer interjected, “yeah,” and the captain 
continued, saying “two thousand feet per minu- don’t go two thousand feet per minute,” and again 
at 1452:07.3, “don’t go two thousand feet per minute.” At no time did he attempt to take control 
of the airplane even though he was responsible for safety of the flight. As the airplane continued 
to descend on the approach, the captain failed to make the required 1,000 ft, 500 ft, 200 ft, and 
100 ft to minimums callouts required by Execuflight SOPs, which would have alerted the first 
officer to his altitude relative to the MDA, and he likely also failed to notice that the airspeed was 
below VREF as he made no comment about it. Radar data indicated that the airplane reached the MDA about 1452:13; at that time, the 
airplane’s airspeed was about 113 knots, and its rate of descent had decreased to about 830 fpm. Upon reaching the MDA, the captain did not call out “minimums” as required by Execuflight 
SOPs. At 1452:17.0, the captain reported that he saw the ground, and, at 1452:20.5, he said, “keep 
going,” although he made no reference to visually acquiring the PAPI or runway environment as 
required by 14 CFR 91.175(c)(1) for descent below the MDA. The first officer did not verbally 
respond to the captain’s command to “keep going” when arriving at the MDA, yet he complied 
with it and continued the descent, indicating his continued loss of situational awareness on the 
approach and his sole reliance on the captain’s instructions. Execuflight SOPs for a stabilized approach required that a missed approach be executed 
if the airplane was not within a defined approach window when within 500 ft above the TDZE.</div>

problem. The extension aggravated the pilot&#x27;s dilemma by preventing him
from climbing to a higher altitude, and extending his exposure to the
encroaching terrain. It also delayed the controller&#x27;s decision that the
aircraft had reached an unsafe position, and his consideration of other
possible courses of action. The events also disclosed that the controller would have beer
better advised to have requested a position report from the pilot at
initial contact. Had that been done, he could have determined the
aircraft&#x27;s position relative to the terrain, and then kept it clear of
the mountain by either amending the route of flight, or altitude or
both, without resorting tu extending the VFR restriction. The controller&#x27;s decision that the aircraft vas in an unsafe
position was based on his determination by yvadar of the aircraft&#x27;s
position relative to the mountain, nowever the situation had probably
become critical 30 seconds earlier when the pilot reported that he was
unable te maintain VFR conditions, and assumed even more critical proportions when the pilot reported he would have to descend in order to
comp.y vith the VFR restriction. Since there was no confliccing traffic
in the a-ea, and in view of the precipitous terrain, the controller
should hare cleared the aircraft to climb in IFR conditions and should

heve taken the necessary teasurces to as: ~ it would remain clear of any
other traffic which could get in its way swever, once the controller
made the decision thar the aircraft was i.. in unsafe position, he did
not hesitate to exercise his emergency authority and vector the aircraft
even though it was below his MVA, ard was not VFR. The vector was
timely; the evidence disclosed that the pilot did turn to avoid the
peak and its associated high terrain. The Safety Board is tnabie to determine what effect tho regqucst
to maintain VFR had on the pilot&#x27;s conduct of the flight efter he received
the vector to 180°. Had the aircraft crashed on a heading approximating
the 180° vector and at an altitude and distance approximating a ccatrolled
descent uuder instrument conditions. further analyais in this area might
be warranted; however it did not. The aircraft&#x27;s altitude at impact,
the elevation of the accident site, and its location when compared with
its position when the controller issued the vector to 180° suggest a
different course of events. N999MB was about 5 nmi couth of Mt. Wrightson when the vector
to reverse course was issued, and the controller saw the aircraft start
a left turn on his radar. He saw the aircraft&#x27;s data block 1 minute
later, and it was further south of the position he had originally acquired
the aircraft&#x27;s target. Its altitude readout was 8,600 ft. The aircraft
impacted on a heading of 095° in a right wing low and noseup attitude. The crash site was about the same distance from Mt.</div>

According to models of human error, the pilots’ performance during the climb and
their decision to operate at 41,000 feet can be described as “optimizing violations,” which
occur when someone disregards defined procedures intentionally to make a job more
interesting or engaging, to push limits, or to impress another.115 For example, the pilots’
CVR statements about operating at an altitude of 41,000 feet were consistent with
thrill-seeking behavior. It is not possible to determine the specific reasons that the pilots
demonstrated these optimizing violations. However, according to situational control
theory, the chance that someone will violate a rule increases when such a violation results
in personal achievement and is likely to go undetected.116 In this case, the Part 91
repositioning flight with no passengers or other crewmembers on board presented the
pilots with an opportunity to reach personal milestones associated with aggressive
maneuvering and operating the airplane at its maximum operating altitude. The Safety Board’s investigation of this accident did not reveal any evidence that
the pilots had previously engaged in the unprofessional behavior demonstrated during the
accident flight. Also, the CVR recording contained no indication that the pilots anticipated
the adverse outcome resulting from their intentional deviations from standard operating
procedures. Such intentional deviations can compromise the margins of safety that are in
place as a result of procedures established by the company, the manufacturer, and the
FAA. A consequence associated with compromising these margins of safety is that the
operator becomes more vulnerable to the catastrophic effects of unintentional errors.117 
Evidence indicated that the critical human performance failures during the flight
were the result of intentional behavior and were not consistent with typical errors (slips,
lapses, and mistakes) found in most flight crew-involved accidents involving Part 121
operators. Although the pilots demonstrated some performance failures and deficiencies
in basic airmanship that were consistent with the more typical errors found in accidents,
such as their failure to achieve required airspeeds during the descent (see section 2.2.3),
the pilots’ overall actions during the accident flight were not consistent with the degree of
discipline, maturity, and responsibility required of professional pilots. The Safety Board
concludes that the pilots’ unprofessional operation of the flight was intentional and causal
to this accident because the pilots’ actions led directly to the upset and their improper
reaction to the resulting in-flight emergency exacerbated the situation to the point that they
were unable to recover the airplane. The Safety Board is concerned about the willful misconduct demonstrated by the
pilots during the accident flight. The Board has investigated other recent accidents in
which pilots did not adhere to standard operating procedures and demonstrated a lack of
cockpit discipline.</div>

Aircraft Accident Report
Statements on the CVR recording indicated that the pilots did not fully understand
the aerodynamic and performance considerations associated with operations at an altitude
of 41,000 feet. Specifically, about 2154:07, the captain stated, “we’re losing here. We’re
gonna be … coming down in a second here.” About 3 seconds later, the captain stated,
“this thing ain’t gonna … hold altitude. Is it?” The first officer responded, “it can’t man. We … (cruised/greased) up here but it won’t stay.” About 2154:19, the captain stated,
“yeah that’s funny we got up here it won’t stay up here.”100
Pinnacle Airlines’ ground school upset training addressed high altitude
aerodynamics, swept-wing design characteristics, and the use of performance charts. Also,
the company’s ground school performance training provided pilots with instruction on
how to use climb capability charts to determine thrust settings for altitudes above
36,000 feet. The CVR recording did not indicate whether the flight crew consulted the
company’s altitude and climb ability charts before initiating the climb to 41,000 feet. However, the Safety Board concludes that the improper airspeed during the climb
demonstrated that the pilots did not understand how airspeed affects airplane performance
and did not realize the importance of conducting the climb according to the published
climb capability charts. Section 2.3.1 discusses high altitude training for regional jet
operations.
2.2.2 Aerodynamic Stall and Upset Event
Even though the pilots recognized that the airplane’s performance was
deteriorating, neither pilot appeared to respond to this situation with urgency. The pilots
contacted the controller about 2154:32 and requested a lower altitude; however, during the
time that the controller was coordinating the descent, the airplane’s airspeed further
deteriorated to Mach 0.53 (150 knots), and the stickshaker activated for the first of five
times. Afterward, the stickshaker activated four times, and the stickpusher activated four
times, pushing the control column forward automatically.101 The flight crew responded to
the stickpusher each time by pulling back on the control column. These control column
inputs caused the airplane’s pitch angle to increase to a maximum ANU value of 29º about
2154:59, and then the airplane entered an aerodynamic stall. Afterward, the airplane’s
pitch angle decreased to a maximum AND value of 32º about 2155:06. While the pitch
angle was decreasing, a left rolling motion began, which eventually reached 82º left wing
down, and the N1 and fuel flow indications for both engines declined steadily to zero,
indicating that both engines had flamed out.</div>

The captain allowed the airplane to accelerate and climb after takeoff consistent with the

not consult an emergency or abnormal procedure checklist.72 Further, CVR evidence indicated 
that, on at least one occasion, it is likely that the first officer made an unrequested trim input. About 1559, at the captain’s request, the first officer advised MKE air traffic controllers that they 
had a control problem and would be returning to the airport. For the remainder of the flight, the 
CVR recorded both pilots communicating on the radio. The CVR also recorded several instances 
in which the captain asked the first officer to help him maintain control of the airplane; the last 
such instance occurred about 1600:36, when the captain asked the first officer to hold the 
airplane’s flight controls so that he could try to pull circuit breakers. The last radar return was 
recorded moments later (just before 1601), about 8 to 9 seconds before the airplane hit the water 
in a steep nose-down, left-wing-low attitude. 
2.2.1 Possible Initiating Event Accident Scenarios 
The NTSB evaluated several possible explanations for the initiating event experienced by 
the pilots and found that two of those possible explanations were most consistent with the 
abnormal control situation: 1) an inadvertent autopilot engagement, or 2) a runaway electric pitch 
trim. Examination of the available evidence, including the items described below, both supports 
and contradicts these scenarios. Without an FDR or image recorder on board, it was not possible to determine the exact 
cause of the initiating event or the pilots’ actions during the accident sequence. If the accident 
airplane had been equipped with crash-protected data- or image-recording equipment,73 the 
NTSB would also have had useful information regarding many other unresolved issues in this 
accident, including whether checklists were silently followed (partially or completely), whether 
and when the trim controls were used, and any other actions and flight control movements made 
by the pilots during the event.</div>

3. Conclusions 3.1 Findings 
1. The captain and first officer were properly certificated and qualified under federal 
regulations to act in their respective roles during the accident flight. There was no evidence 
of any medical conditions that might have adversely affected the pilots’ performance during 
the accident flight. 
2. Although the captain’s pilot certificates had previously been revoked because of a felony 
conviction involving the illegal transport of drugs into the United States, the Federal 
Aviation Administration had reissued his pilot certificates, and they were valid at the time of 
the accident. 
3. The accident airplane was properly certificated, was equipped and maintained in accordance 
with industry practices (except for the wiring installed in the pilots’ control yokes), and was 
within weight and center of gravity limits. 
4. If the accident airplane had been equipped with a recorder system that captured cockpit 
images and parametric data, investigators would have been better able to determine the 
circumstances that led to this accident. 
5. The accident sequence initiated as a result of a control problem that was related to either an 
inadvertent autopilot activation or a pitch trim anomaly, the effects of which were 
compounded by aileron and/or rudder trim inputs; however, it was not possible to determine 
the exact nature of the initiating event. 
6. Regardless of the initiating event, if the pilots had simply maintained a reduced airspeed 
while they responded to the situation, the aerodynamic forces on the airplane would not have 
increased significantly; at reduced airspeeds, the pilots should have been able to maintain 
control of the airplane long enough to either successfully troubleshoot and resolve the 
problem or return safely to the airport. 
7. Pilots would benefit from training and readily accessible guidance indicating that, when 
confronted with abnormal flight control forces, they should prioritize airplane control 
(airspeed, attitude, and configuration) before attempting to identify and eliminate the cause 
of the flight control problem. 
8. The design and location of the yaw damper and autopilot switches on Cessna Citation series 
airplanes do not adequately protect against inadvertent activation of a system, which could 
have disastrous consequences.

9. A rounded type of sheathed wire bundle would fit better and be better protected within the 
control column shaft than the currently installed flat ribbon cable; replacement of the flat 
ribbon cable with a rounded type of sheathed wire bundle could result in fewer short circuits 
and other electrical events. 
10. The incorporation of an aural pitch trim-in-motion warning and contrasting color bands on 
the pitch trim wheel in all Cessna Citation series airplanes would help pilots of those 
airplanes to more promptly recognize and correct runaway pitch trim situations before 
control forces become unmanageable.

they were located. The captain did not respond to the first officer’s question; instead he 
instructed the first officer to declare an emergency and advise ATC of their intention to return to 
MKE. The first officer subsequently used an incorrect aircraft call sign in his radio transmission, 
and the captain corrected him. About 10 seconds before the end of the recording, the captain instructed the first officer 
to take control of the airplane while he, the captain, tried to pull circuit breakers. Seconds later, 
the captain stated, &quot;…we&#x27;re not holding it,&quot; and about 5 seconds later the recording ended. Performance data suggest that almost immediately after the first officer took control, the airplane 
rolled to the left and descended into the lake. It is clear that the captain had at least marginal 
 
89 For example, when the pilots were inbound to MKE, the captain told the first officer, &quot;Don&#x27;t hesitate to ask a 
question…&quot; When the first officer began to prematurely complete the before-landing checklist, the captain told him 
twice to wait until he talked with the control tower. Additionally, the captain coached the first officer to get the 
instrument landing system approach properly displayed on his flight instruments; then, during the landing rollout, 
the captain stated that they would forego the use of spoilers, indicating, &quot;I should have called for &#x27;em. I didn&#x27;t want 
you being confused on it.&quot; As they taxied to the FBO after landing, the captain asked the first officer to call the FBO 
to announce the flight’s arrival; the first officer asked, &quot;What switch do I use for com two?&quot; The captain replied, 
&quot;Number two. Turn your knob. There you go.&quot;

control of the airplane, and the airplane had successfully reversed course to return to the airport 
until the captain transferred control to the first officer. It is possible that the captain believed that 
pulling circuit breakers was the best course of action to avert a loss of control. However, the 
captain’s efforts to maintain control of the airplane had been successful to that point, and he 
could have significantly eased the ongoing and increasing control problem by reducing airspeed. The first officer provided little or no support to the captain during either flight and was 
arguably a distraction because the captain had to monitor the first officer’s actions as well as 
perform flying pilot duties. In addition, as the emergency escalated, the captain began to take 
over the radio calls while he continued to handle the airplane and troubleshoot the control 
problem. Although these distractions might have been benign during a normal flight, they were 
critical during the accident sequence, especially the later stages. The NTSB concludes that, as a 
result of the first officer’s poor flying skills, his lack of airplane systems knowledge, and both 
pilots’ lack of communication and coordination, the first officer provided little help to, and likely 
hindered, the captain during his attempts to deal with the flight control anomalies during the 
accident flight.</div>

shortly after the copilot&#x27;s last transmission remains a possibility. However, such a
condition has not been known to have occurred in a Learjet because of a system or
structural failure. Furthermore, during a 1-minute period following the copilot&#x27;s last
transmission, the airplane remained within 600 feet of its last -ssigned cruising altitude of
FL 390. Moreover, it oscillated within 2,000 feet of this ait. 1de yntil 1158:25, at which
time the airplane&#x27;s rate of descent increased. The Safety Board believes that the altitude
variations between FL 410 and FI. 370 could have been the result of the pilots&#x27; attempts
to control tiie airplane thus negating a rapid decompression. However, for unknown
reasons, they were not able to arrest the descent. If the pilots had perceived the warning
sound as a cabin altitude warning, they may have at some point initiated an emergency
descent. On the other hand, if they perceived it as the mach overspeed warning, they may
have reduced engine thrust and raised the nose of the airplane to bleed off the excessive
speed, which could account for the climb to FL 410. Discounting an explosive or rapid decompression, in the event of a substantial
loss of cabin pressurization, the pilots shouid have had sufficient time to take corrective
action even before becoming incapacitated due to hypoxia. In the event of a
decompression, which could not have been controlled by management of the
environmental systems, an emergency descent cculd have been ecuted. AFM
emergency procedures require an emergency descent to 30,000 feet or below in the event
cabin pressurization becomes above 15,000 feet. The procedure requires, first the

it suddenly pitched up when within 600 feet of that altitude and climbed. The pitchup was followed by two pitch oscillations which were then
follovled by an uncontrolled descent at progressively steeper angles until
impact. The pilots did not or were not able to arrest the uncontrolled descent for
unknown reasons. The reason for the apparent loss of control could not be determined. The wing spoilers, flaps, and landing gear were retracted at the time of
impact. It could not be determined if the crew extended the wing spoilers or
lowered the landing gear at any time during the descent. The pilots probably reduced engine thrust at some time during the
descent because the engines were determined to have been near an {{dle
thrust setting at the time of impact. The horizontal stabilizer actuator jackscrew was in a large noseup trim
position (-4.59 at the time of impact. The airplane struck the water in a steep nosedown, right wing down
attitude at high speed. The AFM recovered from the wreckage did not contain the latest
revision regarding overspeed recovery procedures; however, the copilot
was reportedly aware of the revision. 3.2 Probable Cause

The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause
of the accident was an uncontrolled descent from cruise altitude for undetermined
reasons, from which a recovery was not or could not be effected. 4. RECOMMENDATIONS

As a result of similar accidents involving the Series 20 Learjet, in which the
Safety Board found it difficult or was unable to determine the probable cause due to a
lack of conclusive evidence, it issued several Safety Recommendations to the FAA
directed at improving flight recorder standards and requiring their use in complex general
aviation aircraft. It has also issued to the FAA and to the aviation industry
recommendations aimed at upgrading initial and recurrent pilot training. (See appendix 1)

transponder to the emergency code of 7700 is also required in order to alert ATC. However, wreckage examination showed that the spoilers and landing gear were retracted
at impact. Also, the transponder had not been switched to the emergency code. With regard to the possibility of a turbulence encounter leading to an upset,
two past high altitude loss of control accidents involving Series 20 Leesjets were
attributed to clear air turbulence encounters. In one of the accidents, the Northeast Jet
Company Learjet 25D accident cited previously, a clear air turbulence encounter was
verified, and it led to an overspeed condition and loss of control Although turbulence was
not reported by another Learjet transiting the area at the time of N100TA&#x27;s accident,
analysis of the meteorological conditions disclosed the potential for moderate to severe
clear air turbulence. Based on the Safety Board&#x27;s analysis, the upper atmospheric
structure was similar to, but not as well defined as, the upper atmospheric structure
which existed in the Northeast Jet Company accident. An encounter with clear air
turbulence could have resulted in either a high speed departure or low speed departure
from descending cruise flight. If the pilots had reacted to a turbulen-e upset with a
sudden maneuver which increased the load factor, the airplane may have decelerated into
the low speed buffet boundary and entered an uncontrollable wing roll-off. a steep
nosedown split &quot;S&quot; type maneuver, and a high speed dive. Recovery from a maneuver of
this type could be difficult and perhaps impossible because of the high nosedown pitching
moments associated with flight beyond M,,o. With respect to a high speed buffet excursion or overspeed condition, it would
have been very easy for tne airplane to have accelerated 0.05 Mach to M O (0.82 M)
during the initial descent from FL 410. The airplane descended at a rate of about
700 feet per minute in the 47- to 59~-second interval between the time it left FL 410 and
the time of the copilot’: last transmission. Control difficulties could have resulted if the
crew had allowed tie airplane to accelerate beyond M O into an overspeed condition
because of the nosedown pitching moments associated wil Speeds in excess of the critical
Mach number for the airplane. Considering the potential conditions for moderate to
severe clear air turbulence, a gust upset of sufficient intensity could also have resulted in
an overspeed. According to the ~ “A&#x27;s SCR report, a production error in the copilot&#x27;s
pitot static system, an error resulung in the static sources not being flush with the
fuselage, or a malfunction of the system could be contributing factors leading to an
overspeed. As previously reported in other high altitude loss of control accidents,
abnormal pitch forces and a severe roll control problem could have been encountered
without warning if such conditions had existed. The outcome of an overspeed condition is
greatly dependent upon the pilot&#x27;s reactions. An abrupt noseup elevator control input to
slow the airplane from a descending overspeed would aggravate the condition by
increasing the local Mach effects on the wing (&quot;aileron buzz&quot;) and could have resulted in
the loss of roll contro. Such control inputs might also cause separation of an aileron.</div>

Analysis
2.1
General
The flight crewmembers were properly certificated and had received the training
for pilot certification prescribed by Federal regulations.79 No evidence indicated any
preexisting medical or other physical condition that might have adversely affected the
flight crew’s performance during the accident flight. Fatigue most likely did not degrade
the performance of either pilot on the day of the accident. The accident airplane was properly certificated, equipped, and maintained in
accordance with Federal regulations and approved company procedures. The recovered
components showed no evidence of preexisting powerplant, system, or structural failures. The weight and balance of the airplane were within limits for dispatch, takeoff,
climb, cruise, and landing. This analysis discusses the accident sequence, including weather, ATC, and EVM
VOR issues, and flight crew actions and competence. This analysis also discusses
operational and training issues at Aviation Charter, FAA surveillance of the company, and
the need for low-airspeed alert systems.
2.2
Determination of Flying Pilot
ATC recordings indicated that the accident copilot made all but one of the
transmissions to ATC during the approach and descent. Typically, dual-pilot operations are
conducted with the flying pilot handling the flight controls and the nonflying pilot
handling the communications. Aviation Charter company practices were in accordance
with this standard. However, several Aviation Charter pilots interviewed by Safety Board
investigators indicated that the accident pilot often allowed them to conduct the flights
they flew with him as if they were single-pilot operations (that is, he allowed them to
handle the flight controls and communications and perform all of the checklists without
his assistance). Therefore, the Safety Board could not determine who was flying the
airplane at the time of the accident.
79 As discussed in section 1.5.1.2, there were numerous discrepancies with the pilot’s logbooks that
called into question the accuracy of his flight time record-keeping. However, the investigation found no
evidence indicating that the pilot lacked the required flight time or that these discrepancies in the logbooks
were related to the cause of this accident. Analysis

Accident Sequence of Events
2.3.1 Flight Crew’s Inadequate Setup for the Approach
About 1009, 7 minutes after being instructed to descend from 13,000 feet to
4,000 feet at pilot’s discretion, the copilot reported leaving 13,000 feet. About 1012, the
DLH approach control south radar controller cleared the flight to 3,500 feet. During the
descent to 3,500 feet, the airplane slowed from about 220 to about 190 KCAS. By 1017:35, the airplane had leveled off at 3,500 feet with the airspeed continuing to
decrease.</div>

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] Therefore, the inadequate airspeed or the full CDI needle deflection
should have prompted the flight crew to execute a go-around.
2.3.3 Summary of Flight Crew’s Performance During the 
Approach
In sum, the Safety Board concludes that the flight crew failed to maintain an
appropriate course and speed for the approach and did not properly configure the airplane
at the start of the approach, making the later stages of the approach more difficult. Further,
the Safety Board concludes that, during the later stages of the approach, the flight crew
failed to monitor the airplane’s airspeed and allowed it to decrease to a dangerously low
level (as low as about 50 knots below the company’s recommended approach airspeed)
and to remain below the recommended approach airspeed for about 50 seconds. The Board further concludes that the flight crew failed to recognize that a stall was
imminent and allowed the airplane to enter a stall from which they did not recover. The Board also concludes that the inadequate airspeed or the full CDI needle deflection
should have prompted the flight crew to execute a go-around; however, they failed to do
so. Lastly, the Safety Board notes that if the flight crew had been adhering to Aviation
Charter’s approach procedures and effectively applying CRM techniques in the cockpit, at
least one of the flight crewmembers should have been monitoring the instruments. The
evidence clearly indicates that neither flight crewmember was monitoring the airspeed
indicator or CDI during the approach. Therefore, the Safety Board concludes that the
flight crew was not adhering to Aviation Charter’s approach procedures and was not
effectively applying CRM techniques during the approach segment of the flight. Analysis

Weather Issues
2.4.1 Clouds
Because the surface visibility around the time of the accident was about 3 statute
miles, the flight crew probably would have been able to see the airport to the right of their
course if the airplane had been completely clear of the clouds. However, EVM and
Hibbing surface observations and pilot statements indicate that around the time of the
accident, the cloud bases at and near EVM were somewhere between 1,800 and
2,100 feet.84 The last two recorded radar returns indicate that the airplane was at
approximately 1,800 feet and within 2 miles of the runway 27 threshold. Further, a witness
indicated that he saw the accident airplane “just beneath a low layer of clouds” but that
“the top of the airplane may still have been in the clouds.” Therefore, because the airplane
was most likely in and out of the clouds before the accident, the Safety Board concludes
that clouds might have prevented the flight crew from seeing the airport.
2.4.2 Airframe Icing
The Safety Board considered whether airframe icing could have been a factor in
the accident. Several pilot reports made in the vicinity of EVM about the time of the
accident and an analysis of those reports indicated that icing was likely occurring in two
distinct bands around the time of the accident: moderate icing was present between
approximately 8,000 and 11,000 feet, and light/trace icing was present between
approximately 5,000 and 8,000 feet.</div>

Analysis
2.1
General
The pilot was properly certificated and qualified under Federal regulations. No
evidence indicated any preexisting medical or physical condition that might have
adversely affected the pilot’s performance during the accident flight. The airplane was properly certificated and equipped in accordance with Federal
regulations. The airplane was equipped with FAA-approved flotation gear, as required by
Federal regulations. The airplane was loaded in accordance with FAA-approved company weight and
balance procedures. The weight and balance of the airplane were within prescribed limits
during all phases of the flight. Given the distance from shore at which the ditching occurred and the availability
of emergency response equipment, the search and rescue efforts were timely and
appropriate. The accident was survivable.69 
The inoperative distance measuring equipment on the MYAT VOR was not a
factor in this accident. This analysis discusses the accident sequence, including the airplane’s
performance after the right engine failed and the cause of this failure. This analysis also
discusses Air Sunshine-related maintenance issues, pilot proficiency, and the need for
emergency briefings.
2.2
Accident Sequence
The accident flight departed FLL about 1427. The takeoff and cruise portions of
the flight were uneventful. The pilot reported that the flight’s cruise altitude was about
7,500 feet and that the cruise speed was about 160 KIAS. The pilot reported that, while descending through an altitude of about 3,500 feet at
an airspeed of about 135 to 140 KIAS and a distance of about 20 to 25 miles from MYAT,
he heard a bang and saw oil coming out of the right engine cowling. Several of the
passengers reported seeing white smoke coming from the engine followed by a stream of
oil and then hearing a loud bang. The passengers reported seeing parts falling from the

engine after they heard the loud bang. The pilot reported that, after attempting to shut
down the right engine, he applied full power to the left engine and slowed to about 95 KIAS,
but he could not maintain altitude. He stated that, once the airplane descended through an
altitude of about 1,500 to 1,000 feet, he realized that the airplane could not make it to the
airport and, therefore, he decided to ditch the airplane. The on-site examination of the airplane after it was recovered from the water
revealed that both of the right engine magnetos had penetrated through the engine cowling
and that they were hanging onto the engine by their harnesses. After opening the engine
cowling, the No. 2 cylinder was found separated from the engine crankcase at the cylinder
flange.</div>

protruding magnetos alone were not sufficient to cause the airplane to descend as rapidly
as it did. Other factors that were most likely caused or controlled by the pilot, including
not flying at the recommended airspeeds and flap settings, operating with a bank angle and
sideslip that were not in accordance with Cessna’s recommended in-flight engine failure
configuration, and not maintaining a steady descent, could have degraded the accident
airplane’s performance. If the pilot had been more proficient, he might have been able to
decrease the descent rate enough to maintain flight and reach land. A review of FAA records revealed that, from April 1983 to February 1998, the
pilot failed nine flight checks. The pilot failed two flight checks that he was receiving for
his private pilot certificate, one flight check that he was receiving for his instrument pilot
rating, one flight check that he was receiving for his ATP certificate, two flight checks that
he was receiving for his CFI certificate, and three flight checks that he was receiving for
his CFI instrument rating. Therefore, the Safety Board concludes that the pilot had a history of
below-average flight proficiency, including numerous failed flight tests, before the
accident flight, which contributed to his inability to maintain maximum flight
performance and reach land after the right engine failed.
2.8
Pilot Failure to Use Shoulder Harness
Federal regulations require flight crewmembers of U.S.-registered civil aircraft to
keep their shoulder harnesses fastened during takeoff and landing, including during a
ditching. During postaccident interviews, the pilot stated that he did not have his shoulder
harness fastened during the ditching. He added that, because his harness was not fastened,
he hit his head on the instrument panel when the airplane hit the water, which made him
dizzy. Two passengers indicated that the pilot was incoherent when he was in the water. One of the passengers also stated that the pilot “did not look like he could swim” and that
he had to give the pilot his PFD. Therefore, the Safety Board concludes that the pilot was
not wearing his shoulder harness during the ditching, and, because he was not wearing his
harness, he sustained a head injury that reduced his ability to assist passengers after the
ditching.

The CVR indicates that the crew did encounter considerable

that they.were able to read the altimeters well enough to know that

                        <div class="chunk-text">[CONCLUSIONS] Another crew that questioned a similar
clearance received further instructions and information which resulted in their accepting a radar
surveillance approach to Dulles. )

Both military and civil aviation officials for several
years had indicated concern regarding a lack of
understanding on their part of what the Air Traffic
Control procedures and terminology were intended
to convey to the pilots. They were also concerned
about the possibility of misunderstandings which
could result in pilots descending prematurely.

&#x27; The FAA was not responsive to the long standing,

expressed needs and concerns of the users of the
Air Traffic Control System with regard to pilot/
controller responsibilities pursuant to the issuance
of an approach clearance for a nonprecision
approach. Furthermore, the FAA did not provide
users of the Air Traffic Control System with sufficient information regarding the services provided
by the system under specific conditions. The FAA did not utilize the capability of the ARTS

III system to insure terrain clearance for descending
aircraft conducting nonprecision instrument approaches
in instrument meteorological conditions. The flightcrew of Flight 514 was not familiar with
the terrain west and northwest of Dulles. However,
they did have information regarding the elevation of
obstacles west of Round Hill intersection depicted
on the plan view of the approach procedure.

b.. Probable Cause

The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the
probable cause of the accident was the crew&#x27;s decision to descend to 1, 800
feet before the aircraft had reached the approach segment where that
minimum altitude applied. The crew&#x27;s decision to descend was a result

of inadequacies and lack of clarity in the air traffic control procedures
which led to a misunderstanding on the part of the pilots and of the controllers regarding each other&#x27;s responsibilities during operations in
terminal areas under instrument meteorological conditions. Nevertheless, the examination of the plan view of the approach chart should have
disclosed to the captain that a minimum altitude of 1, 800 feet was not a
safe altitude. ‘ ,

Contributing factors were:

(1) The failure of the FAA to take timely action to resolve
the confusion and misinterpretation of air traffic terminology although
the Agency had been aware of the problem for several years;

(2) The issuance of the approach clearance when the flight
was 44 miles from the airport on an unpublished route without clearly
defined minimum altitudes; and

(3) Inadequate depiction of altitude restrictions on the profile
view of the approach chart for the VOR/DME approach to runway 12 at
Dulles International Airport.

3, RECOMMENDATIONS

As a result of the accident, the Safety Board submitted 14
recommendations to the Administrator of the Federal Aviation
Administration. (See Appendix I.)

Subsequent to the accident, the FAA has taken several actions
in an effort to prevent recurrence of this type of accident.

1. The FAA has directed that all air carrier aircraft be
equipped with a ground proximity warning system by
December 1975.

2. The FAA has revised the provisions of 14 CFR 91 with
regard to pilot responsibilities and actions after receiving a clearance for a nonprecision approach.

3. The FAA has established an incident reporting system
which is intended to identify unsafe operating conditions
in order that they can be corrected before an accident
occurs.

.~ 4] -

4. The FAA has changed its air traffic control procedures
to provide for the issuance of altitude restrictions during
nonprecision instrument approaches.

5. The FAA is installing a modification to the ARTS III
system that will alert air traffic controllers when aircraft deviate from predetermined altitudes while operating
in the terminal area.</div>

The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause 
of this accident was an unexpected encounter witli moderate to severe clear air 
turbulence, the flightcrew&#x27;s improper response to the encounter, and the aircraft&#x27;s 
marginal controllability characteristics when flown at and beyond the boundary of its high

a progressive loss of control from which recovery was not possible. Contributing to the

-29accident was the disconnection of the Mach overspeed warning horn with an unauthorized 
cut-out switch which resulted in the absence of an overspeed warning that probably 
delayed the crew&#x27;s response to the turbulence encounter, and the inconsistencies in 
aircraft flight· manuals and flightcrew training programs regarding the use of spoilers to 
regain control. 4. RECOMMENDATIONS 
As a result of this investigation, the Safety Board issued the following 
recommendation to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration: 
Define the relationship between clear air turbulence and upper 
fronts. as analyzed by soundings and ·develop forecasting techniques 
to utilize the information to improve , clear air turbulence

second wake encounter by moving the control wheel rapidly to the right. Further, unlike
his response to the first wake encounter, the first officer also depressed the right rudder
pedal. 195
The Safety Board considered why the first officer responded differently to the
second wake turbulence encounter than he did to the first encounter. One possibility is the
difference in the bank angle at the beginning of the two encounters. For the first
encounter, the airplane was approximately wings level. Before the second encounter, the
airplane was already in a 23º left bank, and, according to the Board’s simulations, the
rolling moment generated by the second wake would have acted to roll the airplane (in the
absence of countering control inputs) about 10º farther to the left and would have resulted
in no significant yaw.196 However, if the first officer sensed a roll acceleration to the left
while already in a left bank, he may have been prompted to react with a more aggressive
control response. The Safety Board emphasizes that the second wake encounter did not place
flight 587 in an upset condition, and the airplane’s response to the wake did not indicate
that an upset was imminent.197 Therefore, the Safety Board concludes that the first
officer’s initial control wheel input in response to the second wake turbulence encounter
was too aggressive, and his initial rudder pedal input response was unnecessary to control
the airplane. In analyzing the reason for these inputs, the Board evaluated the three factors
discussed in section 2.3: the first officer’s reactions to wake turbulence encounters,
training factors, and the A300-600 rudder control system design.
2.4.1.1 First Officer’s Reactions to Wake Turbulence Encounters
As discussed in section 2.3.1, the first officer had a tendency to overreact to wake
turbulence encounters, indicating an exaggerated concern with such encounters. The first
officer expressed concern before takeoff about the spacing between Japan Air Lines
flight 47 and flight 587, so he was clearly aware of the possibility of encountering wake
turbulence. Further, the first wake turbulence encounter, although brief and minor, would
have heightened the first officer’s awareness of the possibility of additional wake
turbulence, thus preparing him to react to any subsequent encounter. Therefore, the initial
rudder pedal input in response to the second wake turbulence encounter was consistent
195 Minor pedal movements (about 1º) were recorded on the FDR after the first wake encounter. However, these movements were not likely deliberate pedal inputs by the first officer. Further, the rudder
movements recorded during this time were within the authority of the yaw damper and could have been the
result of yaw damper inputs.
196 Nominal movement of the control wheel (and the corresponding aileron and spoiler deflection) could
have countered this amount of additional roll.</div>

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] In this situation, a go-around would not have been necessary; therefore, it
appears the first officer overreacted to this wake turbulence encounter. Two wake turbulence issues were also present before the accident sequence. First,
after receiving clearance for takeoff, the first officer asked the captain whether he was
happy with the separation distance behind Japan Air Lines flight 47.182 The captain
indicated that he was satisfied, and the takeoff proceeded. The first officer’s question
would be expected in this situation and shows that he was aware of the potential for
encountering wake turbulence after flight 587 became airborne. Second, about 0915:36,
flight 587 encountered mild wake turbulence from Japan Air Lines flight 47. The effect of
the turbulence was typical of a minor wake encounter—a momentary 0.3 G drop in normal
load factor, a 0.04 G drop in longitudinal load factor, and a 0.07 G shift in lateral load
factor. However, the first officer reacted to this first wake turbulence encounter by
moving the control wheel rapidly right and left several times, with large control wheel
deflections up to 37o right and 34o left.183 Board investigators noted, during vertical
180 The influence that the AAMP training may have had on the first officer is discussed in
section 2.3.2.2.
181 The Safety Board notes that the captain did not admonish the first officer for using the rudder in
response to wake turbulence but rather for the magnitude of his rudder pedal inputs. The use of rudder by
other pilots in response to wake turbulence is discussed in section 2.4.1.1.
182 Air traffic control had cautioned the pilots about wake turbulence from Japan Air Lines flight 47
while instructing them to taxi into position and hold.
183 The Safety Board notes that the maximum available wheel deflection is 78° in either direction. Despite the first officer’s rapid wheel movements, the airplane remained in relatively level flight because the
inputs were not held long enough to allow the airplane to respond. Analysis

motion simulator testing, that these wheel movements seemed excessive for the
momentary effect that the wake turbulence encounter had on the airplane. On the basis of the two pilots’ accounts of the accident first officer’s response to
wake turbulence on prior flights and his reaction to flight 587’s first wake turbulence
encounter, the Safety Board concludes that the first officer had a tendency to overreact to
wake turbulence by taking unnecessary actions, including making excessive control
inputs.
2.3.2 Training Factors
The Safety Board’s investigation determined that pilots have generally had little
exposure to, and therefore may not fully understand, the effect of large rudder pedal inputs
in normal flight or the mechanism by which rudder deflections induce roll on a
transport-category airplane. In addition, American Airlines’ AAMP training may have
reinforced the first officer’s tendency to respond aggressively to wake turbulence,
encouraged the use of full rudder pedal inputs and misrepresented the airplane’s actual
response to large rudder inputs.</div>

Aircraft Accident Report
Safety Board concludes that the witnesses who reported observing the airplane on fire174
were most likely observing a fire from the initial release of fuel or the effects of engine
compressor surges. Shortly after takeoff, flight 587 encountered wake turbulence from Japan Air Lines
flight 47—first at 0915:36 and again at 0915:51. Immediately after the onset of
flight 587’s second wake turbulence encounter (about 7 seconds before the vertical
stabilizer separation), the FDR recorded a series of five cyclic movements of the rudder
and rudder pedals. The Safety Board’s investigation did not reveal any indication of a
mechanical failure that could have caused these movements. The Board’s ground tests of
the rudder control system on another A300-600 revealed that rudder movement created by
a yaw damper or an autopilot input to the system resulted in an FDR recording of the
rudder and rudder pedal parameters that did not match the timing and sequence of the
movements recorded by flight 587’s FDR. The only way to move the rudder in a manner
that created an FDR trace of these parameters that matched flight 587’s FDR trace was for
the pilot to depress the rudder pedals. Therefore, the Safety Board concludes that flight
587’s cyclic rudder motions after the second wake turbulence encounter were the result of
the first officer’s rudder pedal inputs. (Possible explanations for the first officer’s rudder
pedal inputs are discussed in section 2.3.) 
During the time that the first officer was making the five cyclic rudder pedal
inputs, the captain began to question him (at 0915:55 he asked, “you all right?”) and
coached him (at 0915:56 he said, “hang on to it”). However, the captain did not intervene
or take control of the airplane, which would have been within his authority as
pilot-in-command. It appears that the captain believed that the wake was causing the
airplane motion, even after the vertical stabilizer had separated from the airplane (saying,
at 0916:12, “get out of it, get out of it”). It would have been difficult for the captain to
observe the first officer’s rudder pedal inputs.175 Accordingly, given the captain’s limited
knowledge of the circumstances and the short duration of the accident sequence, the
captain’s response to the situation was understandable.

transponder to the emergency code of 7700 is also required in order to alert ATC. However, wreckage examination showed that the spoilers and landing gear were retracted
at impact. Also, the transponder had not been switched to the emergency code. With regard to the possibility of a turbulence encounter leading to an upset,
two past high altitude loss of control accidents involving Series 20 Leesjets were
attributed to clear air turbulence encounters. In one of the accidents, the Northeast Jet
Company Learjet 25D accident cited previously, a clear air turbulence encounter was
verified, and it led to an overspeed condition and loss of control Although turbulence was
not reported by another Learjet transiting the area at the time of N100TA&#x27;s accident,
analysis of the meteorological conditions disclosed the potential for moderate to severe
clear air turbulence. Based on the Safety Board&#x27;s analysis, the upper atmospheric
structure was similar to, but not as well defined as, the upper atmospheric structure
which existed in the Northeast Jet Company accident. An encounter with clear air
turbulence could have resulted in either a high speed departure or low speed departure
from descending cruise flight. If the pilots had reacted to a turbulen-e upset with a
sudden maneuver which increased the load factor, the airplane may have decelerated into
the low speed buffet boundary and entered an uncontrollable wing roll-off. a steep
nosedown split &quot;S&quot; type maneuver, and a high speed dive. Recovery from a maneuver of
this type could be difficult and perhaps impossible because of the high nosedown pitching
moments associated with flight beyond M,,o. With respect to a high speed buffet excursion or overspeed condition, it would
have been very easy for tne airplane to have accelerated 0.05 Mach to M O (0.82 M)
during the initial descent from FL 410. The airplane descended at a rate of about
700 feet per minute in the 47- to 59~-second interval between the time it left FL 410 and
the time of the copilot’: last transmission. Control difficulties could have resulted if the
crew had allowed tie airplane to accelerate beyond M O into an overspeed condition
because of the nosedown pitching moments associated wil Speeds in excess of the critical
Mach number for the airplane. Considering the potential conditions for moderate to
severe clear air turbulence, a gust upset of sufficient intensity could also have resulted in
an overspeed. According to the ~ “A&#x27;s SCR report, a production error in the copilot&#x27;s
pitot static system, an error resulung in the static sources not being flush with the
fuselage, or a malfunction of the system could be contributing factors leading to an
overspeed. As previously reported in other high altitude loss of control accidents,
abnormal pitch forces and a severe roll control problem could have been encountered
without warning if such conditions had existed. The outcome of an overspeed condition is
greatly dependent upon the pilot&#x27;s reactions. An abrupt noseup elevator control input to
slow the airplane from a descending overspeed would aggravate the condition by
increasing the local Mach effects on the wing (&quot;aileron buzz&quot;) and could have resulted in
the loss of roll contro. Such control inputs might also cause separation of an aileron.</div>

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] Although the airplane was extensively damaged by impact forces, its
extremeties were recovered. Consequently, since these components usually separate
during a substantial in-flight breakup, en in-flight explosion was discounted. The right
aileron was not found, but it may not have been located because of the severe destruction
of the airplane during impact and because of the difficulties encountered in locating
wreckage in an underwater recovery. However, because of the circumstances of the
accident, the possibility of an in-flight separation of the aileron could not be ruled out.

2.3 Weather

The area in which the airplane was flying just before its descent from FL 410
was between converging polar and subtropical jet streams and was on the leading edge of
a sharp upper ridge moving eastward at a speed of about 20 knots. An analysis of the
vertical structure of the atmosphere showed an apparent upper front in the area near
FL 419. This structure was sufficiently well defined and contained adequate wind shear to
nave developed moderate or possibly severe clear air turbulence. Althouch there should
have been some continuity between the high level weather depiction chart prepared by the
National Meteorological Center and the charts from the National Weather Service
Fore cust Offices at Washington and Miami, it is likely that the turbulence forecast in the
2100 Area Forecast was not included in the 0900 Area Forecast from Washington, and was
not included in either the 2190 or 0900 Area Forecasts from Miami, because of the lack of
pilot reports te zonfirm any turbulence. Further, the weather situation before and at the
time of the accident did not meet the normal National Weather Service criteria for the
existence of clear air turbulence. Consequently, the forecasters at the iwo forecast
offices apparently followe i accepted procedures in not forecasting turbulence where none
had been reported. The Safety Board&#x27;s weather analysis shows that a potential for clear
air turbulence existed. Even though the existence of clear air turbulence cannot be
conclusively determined without a:; observation, such as a pilot report, the conditions
conducive to clear air turbulence which existed in this accident and in other loss of
control accidents from high sititude involving the Series 20 Learjets, leads the Safety
Board to believe that the possibility of a turbulence encounter severe enough to upset the
airplane and precipitate a loss of control cannot be excluded. Consequently, the board
will reemphasize to the NWS the importance of expediting an early solution to the clear
air turbulence analysis and forecasting problem.

2.4 Loss of Control

Analysis of the radar data showed that the airplane was in straight and level
flight at FL 410 for at least 2 minutes 16 seconds before the Air Traffic Control (ATC)
clearance was given to the pilots to descend and maintain FL 390. Also, radar and
meteorological data indicated that the airplane probably was flying at a consezvative
cruise speed of about 0.77 M. The copilot immediately acknowledged the desecnt
clearanze, but the airplane did not descend until 28 to 41 seconds later.</div>

it suddenly pitched up when within 600 feet of that altitude and climbed. The pitchup was followed by two pitch oscillations which were then
follovled by an uncontrolled descent at progressively steeper angles until
impact. The pilots did not or were not able to arrest the uncontrolled descent for
unknown reasons. The reason for the apparent loss of control could not be determined. The wing spoilers, flaps, and landing gear were retracted at the time of
impact. It could not be determined if the crew extended the wing spoilers or
lowered the landing gear at any time during the descent. The pilots probably reduced engine thrust at some time during the
descent because the engines were determined to have been near an {{dle
thrust setting at the time of impact. The horizontal stabilizer actuator jackscrew was in a large noseup trim
position (-4.59 at the time of impact. The airplane struck the water in a steep nosedown, right wing down
attitude at high speed. The AFM recovered from the wreckage did not contain the latest
revision regarding overspeed recovery procedures; however, the copilot
was reportedly aware of the revision. 3.2 Probable Cause

The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause
of the accident was an uncontrolled descent from cruise altitude for undetermined
reasons, from which a recovery was not or could not be effected. 4. RECOMMENDATIONS

As a result of similar accidents involving the Series 20 Learjet, in which the
Safety Board found it difficult or was unable to determine the probable cause due to a
lack of conclusive evidence, it issued several Safety Recommendations to the FAA
directed at improving flight recorder standards and requiring their use in complex general
aviation aircraft. It has also issued to the FAA and to the aviation industry
recommendations aimed at upgrading initial and recurrent pilot training. (See appendix 1)

Although these two scenarios were the most likely explanations for the initiating flight

problem that was related to either an inadvertent autopilot activation or a pitch trim anomaly, the 
effects of which were compounded by aileron and/or rudder trim inputs; however, it was not 
possible to determine the exact nature of the initiating event. Regardless of what the initiating event was, evidence from Cessna flight test records, 
postaccident simulator tests, and the NTSB’s postaccident performance study indicated that the 
result would have been controllable if the captain had not allowed the airspeed and resulting 
control forces to increase while he tried to troubleshoot the problem. Evidence showed that, 
despite the abnormal control situation, the captain was able to maintain control of the airplane 
without much exertion when the airplane was operating at a relatively slow airspeed shortly after 
takeoff, but he increasingly struggled as the airplane accelerated and the control forces increased. By allowing the airplane’s airspeed to increase while engaging in haphazard and poorly 
coordinated troubleshooting efforts, the pilots allowed an abnormal situation to escalate to an 
emergency. Therefore, the NTSB concludes that, regardless of the initiating event, if the pilots 
had simply maintained a reduced airspeed while they responded to the situation, the aerodynamic 
forces on the airplane would not have increased significantly; at reduced airspeeds, the pilots 
should have been able to maintain control of the airplane long enough to either successfully 
troubleshoot and resolve the problem or return safely to the airport. If the accident pilots had sought guidance for either of the potential scenarios in the 
airplane’s checklists or manuals, they would not have found it, because no such guidance existed. However, AFM guidance for a different control anomaly (a jammed elevator trim) suggests that, 
in the face of an unexpected and unidentified control problem, a pilot should maintain a 
configuration and airspeed already proven to be controllable.83 
In partial response to an NTSB safety recommendation issued after a series of 
upset-related air carrier accidents (A-96-120), an industry team developed an airplane upset 
recovery training aid designed to “increase the ability of pilots to recognize and avoid situations 
that can lead to airplane upsets and to improve their ability to recover control of an airplane….” 
The FAA has issued an NPRM, which,84 if adopted as a rule, would require minimum standards 
for 14 CFR Part 121 flight crewmember upset and loss of control training that references the 
airplane upset recovery training aid.</div>

the accident sequence was confused. According to the NTSB’s performance study, the lateral and 
directional handling problems that would result from inadvertent autopilot activation and mistrim

airplane accelerated and turned further from the runway extended centerline heading. The effects 
 
75 The Citation 550 pilots involved with the simulator testing during the investigation stated that each, at one 
time in their careers, had inadvertently pushed the autopilot instead of the yaw damper buttons. 
76 About 35 seconds after takeoff, after the captain made his third mention of an unspecified control problem, 
the first officer stated, “how’s your trim set? Is that the way you want it?” About 12 seconds later, after the captain 
stated that the airplane wanted to “turn hard left,” the first officer asked, “how’s your trim down here?” Finally, 
about 1 ½ minutes after takeoff, the first officer asked, “how’s that, any better?”

of the autopilot turning the airplane toward the runway’s magnetic heading and the forces 
resulting from the mistrimmed condition ultimately would have demanded strenuous inputs from 
both pilots to maintain control. The performance study results were consistent with many aspects of this interpretation of 
the accident sequence. For example, the captain first complained of a control problem just 
moments after the airplane would have begun to turn from the initial autopilot engagement 
heading in accordance with the departure clearance, when an inadvertently activated autopilot 
would have been trying to return the airplane to the initial autopilot engagement heading. About 
1 1/2 minutes later, after the control problem had escalated (likely as a result of the first officer’s 
trim inputs and the captain allowing the airplane to accelerate while he dealt with the 
unidentified control problem), the captain decided to declare an emergency and return to MKE. The final loss of control began about 1 minute later, just after the captain transferred the controls 
to the first officer to look for the autopilot circuit breaker. The performance study showed that 
the transfer of control occurred when the airplane was heading back towards MKE and passed 
through and moved away from the autopilot engagement heading, which, according to this 
scenario, would have resulted in dynamically changing forces on the control wheel as the 
autopilot reversed the direction of its input in an attempt to return to the runway heading. Other evidence was inconsistent with this scenario, however. For example, examination 
of the recovered autopilot servomotor clutches and the unstretched filaments in the cockpit 
autopilot-engaged light bulb (which was not illuminated at impact) suggested that, although the 
autopilot did have power at impact, it was likely not engaged at impact.77 Some stretching was 
observed in the yaw-damper-engaged bulb filaments.</div>

3. Conclusions 3.1 Findings 
1. The captain and first officer were properly certificated and qualified under federal 
regulations to act in their respective roles during the accident flight. There was no evidence 
of any medical conditions that might have adversely affected the pilots’ performance during 
the accident flight. 
2. Although the captain’s pilot certificates had previously been revoked because of a felony 
conviction involving the illegal transport of drugs into the United States, the Federal 
Aviation Administration had reissued his pilot certificates, and they were valid at the time of 
the accident. 
3. The accident airplane was properly certificated, was equipped and maintained in accordance 
with industry practices (except for the wiring installed in the pilots’ control yokes), and was 
within weight and center of gravity limits. 
4. If the accident airplane had been equipped with a recorder system that captured cockpit 
images and parametric data, investigators would have been better able to determine the 
circumstances that led to this accident. 
5. The accident sequence initiated as a result of a control problem that was related to either an 
inadvertent autopilot activation or a pitch trim anomaly, the effects of which were 
compounded by aileron and/or rudder trim inputs; however, it was not possible to determine 
the exact nature of the initiating event. 
6. Regardless of the initiating event, if the pilots had simply maintained a reduced airspeed 
while they responded to the situation, the aerodynamic forces on the airplane would not have 
increased significantly; at reduced airspeeds, the pilots should have been able to maintain 
control of the airplane long enough to either successfully troubleshoot and resolve the 
problem or return safely to the airport. 
7. Pilots would benefit from training and readily accessible guidance indicating that, when 
confronted with abnormal flight control forces, they should prioritize airplane control 
(airspeed, attitude, and configuration) before attempting to identify and eliminate the cause 
of the flight control problem. 
8. The design and location of the yaw damper and autopilot switches on Cessna Citation series 
airplanes do not adequately protect against inadvertent activation of a system, which could 
have disastrous consequences.

9. A rounded type of sheathed wire bundle would fit better and be better protected within the 
control column shaft than the currently installed flat ribbon cable; replacement of the flat 
ribbon cable with a rounded type of sheathed wire bundle could result in fewer short circuits 
and other electrical events. 
10. The incorporation of an aural pitch trim-in-motion warning and contrasting color bands on 
the pitch trim wheel in all Cessna Citation series airplanes would help pilots of those 
airplanes to more promptly recognize and correct runaway pitch trim situations before 
control forces become unmanageable.

prevented it from continued flight, the seriousness of the In-flight divergence from 
controlled flight, and the unusual mode of failure of th? elevators on a relatively 
newly designed airplane, gave cause for concern and prompted the Safety Board&#x27;s 
investigation. It also provided the Safety Board with the opportunity to examine the 
current technology concerning composite structures and their use in state-of-the-art 
airplanes. The outboard sections 3f both the right ana left elevators exhibited 
similar separation signatures indicating that the failwes were produced by a 
symmetrical loading condition. The evidence indicated that the elevatars exhibited 
fracture, delarninatiorl, and disbonding of the upper right and lower left outboard 
skin panel assemblies with predominantly adhesive failure modes. Tke Safety Board considered sources of loads that could have causd 
ihe failures. Among the areas examined were weather, flightcrew actions, SinICturdl 
design, surface preparaticn, and Statistical analysis and design substantiation.

Weather - Turbulence 
Winds at FL 330 were westerly at abut 88 hots. A maximum wind 
speed of about 155 knots occurred around FL 400. The tropopause was around 
45,oM) feet. Based on data obtained from the Japan Meteorological Agency and 
McIDAS? it was determined that significant turbulence and up and down vefiical 
motions probably occured in the area of the incident at FL 330. Calculated values 
for vertical and horizontal windshears were conducive to turbulence of at least 
moderate inten~ity.~ 
Calculated Richardson numbers&#x27;&#x27; were also consistent with a 
turbulent atmosphere. Several PIREPS in the area indicated moderate to severe 
turbulence.I1 In addition, there is some evidence that significant convection was 
Clccarring in the area of the incident. FDR data show that the airplane was 
encountering moderate turbulence at the time of the upset, as defmed by fhe 
recorded G forces. Consequently, the Safety Board concludes that flight CI-012 
encountered moderate turbulence that preceded the violent motions of the airplane.

The Safety Board analyzed the FDR data to determine how the 
turbulence and pilot reactions resulted in the loss of control sf the airplane. A study by the National Aeronautics and Space Ahninistmtion&#x27;s

induce changes in angle of attack that are independent of pitch, but elevator control 
inputs induce changes in angle of attack that are correlated to pitch.” Therefore, if 
an AOA time hisiory is correlated to the pitch attitude time history, then the zirplme 
is not affec?ed by turbulence and is considered controllable in the vertical axis. Time history plots of flight CI-012’s elevator, pitch attitude, and AOA 
reveal than the trends of the airplane pitch a&amp;itude data closely follow the trends of 
the A0.4 and elevator deflection throughout most of the upset and recovery. Aileron and elevator control deflections commanded by h\e pilot resulted in 
excessive roll and pitch excursions, at least four aerodynamic stalls, and almost 
continuous stall v:aming activation for a period of about 2 minutes and 45 seconds. The initial deviation from cruise flight was the result of a lateral gust 
from the left side of the airplane. The gust pduced an ANR sideslip that resulted 
in the airplane naturaliy rolling right and yawing left. The autopilot disconnected, 
probably from excessive roll rate, and the pilot applied EWD wheel deflection to 
counteract the increasing right rGTi angle. As the RWD roll rate was arrested, the 
LWD wheel deflection was not reduced rapidly enough io prevent a roll angle of 
25 degrees to the left. The pilot commanded excessive control column deflections concitmnt 
with the excessive wheel deflections. The control column deflections resulted in 
rqidly increasing AOA and pitch angles that produced a high speed acceleration of 
about 1-65 G for about 8 seconds. The airplane transitioned into a 
7,009 feet-per-minute climb €or the nex: 30 seconds and slowed to the 1 G stall 
speed. In addition, during the latter parts of the recovery, the pilot continued a:, 
use 
excessive eievator deflection that resuited in excursions between 0.6 G and 1.6 G. Although DAC recommends that the airplane not be retrimed 
following a high altitude, high spced loss of control, the pilot applied ANU trim 
during the climb.</div>

The flightcrew was certificated and qualified for the flight. Tne airplane was certificated and maintained in accordance with 
applicable regulations. Tne airplane was aispatcned in accordance wifi company 
procedures and Taiwanese regulations. There were no 2ir traffic control factors in the cause of the 
incident. The airplane encountered moderate turbulence. Recorda! values of flight CI-012’s lateral acceleration, heading, 
and roll angle indicate that a lateral gust initiated the upset. The autopilot disengaged, probably because of excessive roll 
rate, during the lateral gust. FDR dara indicate that the airplme stalied at least four times 
before the recovery. The flightcrew’s reactions to the lateral gust exacerbated the 
siruation 2nd led to significant pitch a d airspeed deviations and 
the unset of the airpiane’s stall warning. Because of the aft center-of-gravity (CG) position at which the 
MD-I i airplane is designed to be flown in high-altitude cruise, 
the airpime operates at lower longitudinal stability margins. Since ?here 2re no compensatory changes in the airplane’s pitch 
control system, control forces are lighter than for most 
conventional transport airplanes while performing comparable 
maneuvers. Consequently, a pilot is more likely to overcontrol 
the MD-11 airplane during recovery from a turbulence upsct. This overcontrol can lead to excessive positive load factors that

41 
can cause the aiqlane to enter stail buffet, and/or to excessive 
negative load factors that can lead to severe injuries to 
unrestrained passengers.

Upon approach to the stall, the MD- I 1&#x27;s Longitudinal Stability 
Augmentation System introduces a nose-down pitching moment 
that requires a heavy control force to counter. The captain 
continued to exert back force on the control column and thus 
maintained a stall condition, resulting in further excursion into 
the buffet regime.

The vortex encounter simulation shows that
the onset of turbulence would have been signaled by a moderate left roll which would
probably not have been of serious concern to
the flightcrew, The reflex reaction of the pilot
would have been to make a right lateral conzrol
input in an attempt to maintain a wings-level
attitude, This action, once initiated, would hive
caused the airplane to penetrate dceper into the

became concerned. An order by the check airman to “go around” was followed immediately
by a call for “takeoff power.”

At an altitude of approximately 50 feer above
the ground, the pilot’s most immediate concern
would have been devoted to maintaining level
flight. Whether takeoff power was actually
applied could not be determined. It is possible
that the ~“xention of both pilots was diverted by
the roll problem to the point that there might
have been some hesitation to remove one hand
from the control yoke to effect power lever
movement, It is also possible that the power
levers were moved forward but that the norraal
lag in engine acceleration delayed the thrust
response to maximum t.p.m. Engine acceleration
could have been compromised further by transient compressor stalls which could have been
caused by the vortex-produced airflow disruption at the engine inlet. There were no indications of engine overtemperature conditions;
however, a transient scall might not have produced discernible overtemperature evidence. Whatever the reason, there was no positive
indication in the evidence provided by the flight

At 0723330, the DC-9 was at a critivally low
altitude, deep within the influence of the vortex
flow field. The stall warning (‘stick shaker’)
was activated as a result of the high angle of
attack, which was induced by the vortex verticé
flow component, ‘The pilots were, in all probability, sil countering a left rolling tendency by

application of right aileron control when the airplane moved into the vortex core. The resultant
load reversal would have induced a sherp roll to
the right. The pilots would then have rcsponded
immediately with a control reversal: however, at
this time, the magnitude of the induced rolling
moment and the normal lag in pilot’s reaction,
control system, and aerodynamic response were
such that recovery was impossible. The DC-9
right wingtip struck the rurway surface in an
uncontrolled attitude. The Board believes that the actions of the
flightcrew were normal for the circumstances,
Because of the moderate nature of the initial
roll, and possibly because of the uneventful experiences with past encounters with less severc
vortices, neither the flightcrew nor the FAA
inspector associated the initial turbulence with
impending loss of control. As a result, the decision to 2xecute a missed approach was not
made in time to avoid this accident. The meterological conditions existing at th:
time of the accident and the nature of the surrounding terrain were perhaps as adverse as
possible in relation to vortex persistence. The
stable atmospheric conditions and the relatively
flat terrain produced no disturbing influences to
accelerate breakup of the vortex flow. The crosswind component caused the vortex
to remain in the runway centerline area by preventing the lateral motion normally produced by
ground interaction, The slight tailwind component further .yravated the situation by
moving the turb.ione ait mass back into the runway threshold area,

To establish airplane landing and takeoff
separations, the air traffic controller is guided by
those criteria specified in FAA Handbook
7110,8B and Order 7110.29, The FAA Handbouk addresses itself to the terminal area operation including the controller’s responsibility in
both [FR and VFR landing situations, The aircraft separation criteria which are specified in

although the term “heavy” was not used on the

The Board believes that if cither the pilots of
the [C-9 or the FAA inspector had recognized
the hazard of their situation at that time, they
would have extended the downwind leg to increase the separation interval. The facc that such
an action or recommendation was not taken is
attributed to one or more of the following
factors:

1. The pilots and the FAA inspector might
have been engrossed in conducting the
circling approach in accordance with the
procedures specified in the Delta DC-9
operating manual, The DC-9 flightcrew adhered to these procedures explicitly and, in
doing so, might not have recognized the
hazard of their proximity to the DC-10
with regard to wake turbulence,

2. The flightcrew and the FAA inspector were
aware of the proximity of th: “heavy” jet
and, although cognizant of the nature of
turbulence associated with trailing tip vortices, did not correctly assess the hazard to
a DC-9, The evidence indicates an apparent
widespread belief that the vortex hazard
was a problem for small general aviation
aircraft and that, although uncomfortable,
it is not dangerous to an airplane of the size
and weight of the DC-9, ‘Phe fact that this
is only the second instance in which vortex
wake turbulence has been considered a
causal factor in the crash of a moderately
large airplane lends further support to this
misconception,

3. Finally, the flightcrew’s complacent
attitude toward the tower controller&#x27;s
“caution turbulence” advisory might have
resulted from the “cry wolf” syndrome.</div>

The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause 
of this accident was an unexpected encounter witli moderate to severe clear air 
turbulence, the flightcrew&#x27;s improper response to the encounter, and the aircraft&#x27;s 
marginal controllability characteristics when flown at and beyond the boundary of its high

a progressive loss of control from which recovery was not possible. Contributing to the

-29accident was the disconnection of the Mach overspeed warning horn with an unauthorized 
cut-out switch which resulted in the absence of an overspeed warning that probably 
delayed the crew&#x27;s response to the turbulence encounter, and the inconsistencies in 
aircraft flight· manuals and flightcrew training programs regarding the use of spoilers to 
regain control. 4. RECOMMENDATIONS 
As a result of this investigation, the Safety Board issued the following 
recommendation to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration:

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] According to the captain, he reduced the throttles to flight idle well before he
extended the speed brakes. Consequently, the Safety Board believes that shortly before
2147:54, the captain removed his right hand from the control wheel and used his right
hand to retard the throttles to flight idle. Moreover, we believe that the aircraft was
then in a substantial sideslip condit‘on which, perhaps in conjunction with some relaxation
of the lateral controls or less than optimum le/t roll authority, caused the aircraft to
exceed its critical controllability parameters and to roll uncontrollably into a rapid
spiralling descent. As stated before, we are not ele tv fully explain hy the loss of contro:
occurred. However, we note that the foregoing explanation is consiste,.t to some degree
with the captain&#x27;s statements about his manipulation of flight and throttle controls. Also,
we believe that under the circumstances, after having apparently controlled the initial
roll to the right, it would not have been unusual for the captain to have diverted his
attention from the flight instruments to other instruments and controls in an effort to
determine the cause of the initial roll and the cause cf the continuing airframe buffet,
particularly since the other crewmembers apparently were nci aware initially of the
aircraft&#x27;s condition. As shown in figure 5, the second roll to a 35° right bank oncurred in about 4
seconds—a comparatively brief period in which even a slight distraction could have been
critical. At the conclusion of the 4 seconds, the roll was stopped for a few seconds which
indicates that lateral controls probabi,’ were applied quickly and fully in response to the
comparatively rapid rate of roll. Since the captain followed the application of lateral
conircls with a significant amount of rudder, as indicated by his statements, we concluce
that a sideslip condition was generated which placed the aircraft in a laterally
uncontvo. lable condition as evidenced by the resumption of the roll to the right. Further,
it is possible that cocking or deflection of the No. 7 slat added to rolling moment
imbalance at this critical point. Thereafter, the speeds and angles of attack generated by
the rapid descer* and high g-forees combined with the extenJed No, 7 slat to keep the
aircraft in an uncontrollable condition until the slat was torn from the wing. During the investigation, questions were raised about why the flightcrew might
have extended the leading edge slats under the existing operating conditions.</div>

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] When mach number
or angle of attack was below these values, the aircraft should have been controllable
laterally and when exceeded, the aircraft would have been uncontrollable laterally. The reason for the lack of controllability when the critical values are
exceeded is the severe disruption of airflow and associated loss of lift that occurs over
the wing area aft of the extended slat. The loss of lift creates a rolling moment that
exceeds the countermoment the oilot can produce with full deflection of lateral controls. The aircraft will respond to the imbalance of rolling moments by rolling uncontrollably
toward the wing with the extended slat. By omitting any effecis of sideslip, the
calculated values of mach number and anyle of attack estabiished that the accident.
aircraft was laterally uncontrollable after 2148:07. At that time, the aircraft&#x27;s indicated
airspeed was about 270 knots (0.83 mach), its altitude was about 36,500 feet, and its rate
of descent was in excess of 34,000 feet per minute. After the No. 7 slat was torn ‘rom the aircraft, lateral control was restored
and the captain was able to roll the wings parallel to the horizontal and recover from the
spiral dive. Simulations of the spiral dive confirmed that loss of the slat restored lateral
control and made recovery possible. Also, simulations indicated that although extension
of the landing geer significantly reduced the aircraft&#x27;s speed (and mach number), recovery
would have been doubtful without loss of the slat because of the high angles of attack
which were developed during the latter part of the descent. Because of the conflict between the captain&#x27;s assertions regarding the
ineffectiveness of lateral controls and the aerodynamic evidence related to aircraft
performance and controllability, significant efforts were made to determine the aircraft&#x27;s
actual motions and performance”, as reflected in its FDR traces, subsequent to the first

observed anomalies in the g-trace. These efforts included additional heading gyro tests,
extensive calculaticns of gimbal error associated with heading gyro performance, and
flight tests,

Analysis of flight test and flight simulator data indicated that high rates of
heading change, such as the 5° in 0.5 second that oceurred about 2147:45 in the accident
aireraft&#x27;s heading trace, could not be achieved unless the aircraft was in a banked attitude
with high load factors applied. Since the load factor was about 1.0 g at thai time, the
rapid heading change could not have been associated with turning flight. Also, during
flight tests, a full rudder deflection sideslip, when released, did not produce such a rapid
heading change, and during sudden extensions of the No. 7 slat in flight simulations, the
heading changed comparatively slowly to the right. However, the heading gyro tests and
heading gyro gimbal error calculations showed that such an apparent rate of heading
change eould have beer produced by a rapid roll to the left. Consequently, it was
hypothesize? that during the preceding 12-second period between 2147:33 and 2147:45,
the aircraft had rolled to the right.</div>

probably because tensile forces created by air loads combined with
friction and side forces on the piston rod, caused by preexisting
miscasignmen* of the slat, exceeded the available hydraulic retraction
force. The No. 7 leading edge slat in the extended position created rolling
inoments to the right that could have been countered with about 46° of
control wheel deflection to the left; an additiono, 13° of control wheel
Gefiection would have been needed to counter moments associated with a
l-ineh upware float of che right outboard aileron. After recognizing the right roll condition, the captain rolled the aircraft
to a near wings-level upright positien; thereafter, through untimely use
of the flight controls, he permitted the aircraft to roll to the right into
an uncontrollabie attitude. The captain probably was distracted
immediately after restoring the aircraft to near level flight by his
efforts in attempting to rectify the source of the control problem. The captain probably induced sideslip shortly before 2147:54 when the
aircrafi was at mazh 0.79, an angle of attack of 5.7°, and an angle of
bank of about 35° to the right. A sideslip angle of 4.6° to the right could
have caused the aircraft to become laterally uncontrollable. The aircraft descended in a spiral dive from 39,000 to about 5,000 feet in
63 seconds; during the descent, the aircraft&#x27;s speed increased to a
maximum speed of about 0.96 mach at 31,300 feet. When the aircraft&#x27;s speed exceeded 0.83 mach and its angle of attack
exceeded 6° near 36,500 feet, the rolling moments caused by the
extended No. 7 slat suostantially exceeded the maximum available
lateral control authority at 0° of sideslip. The aireraft was not ecntrollable during its descent below «&quot;sout 36,500
feet un:il the No. 7 leading edge slat separated from the right wing. Vertical acceleration forces increased throughout the spiral descent to a
maximum: of about 6.0 g&#x27;s during the recovery. The accident was survivable.
22. Minor injuries to passengers were caused by the g-forces. 3.2 Probable Cause

The Safety Board determines that the probable ceuse of this accident was the
isolation of the No. 7 leading edge slat in the fully or partially extended position after an
extension of the Nos. 2, 3, 6, and 7 leading edge slats ard the subsequent retraction of the
Nos. 2, 3, and 6 slats, and the captain&#x27;s untimely flight control inputs to counter the roll
resulting from the slat asymmetry.</div>

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] The Safety Board considered and could not conclusively discard the
possibility that the nacelle damage was caused by the maneuvering and air loads
imposed on the structure during the out-of-control descent. If this were the case,
the distortion of the nacelle and engine mounts could have moved the propeller
control linkage to feather, which in turn would have resulted in a less of blade
centrifugal loads, which permitted the blades to separate. The Safety Board
believes that it is more probable that the loss of the propeller blades was initiated
when the crew attempted to feather the left engine in the belief that an engine
overspeed had occurred. The loss of centrifugal loads on the blades as the
propeller rotational speed slowed, combined with the severe cyclic loads imposed
on the blades-during the departure from stabilized flight, would have allowed the
blades to rock in the hub with consequent failure of the blade retaining rings,
release of the bearings, and blade separation. The Safety Board believes that the
imbalance of the propeller assembly as the blades separated imposed the high
vibratory loads to the engine shaft, which produced the nacelle damage. Thus, the Safety Board believes that while the propeller blade separation was
a result of the loss of control, it contributed to the severity of the accident, in that
the effective loss of one engine and the nacelle damage resulted in a performance
degradation that limited the captain’s ability to control the airplane and maintain
altitude. The limited control led to a long landing touchdown and subsequent
overrun. Flightcrew Performance
Selection of Improper Autoflight Mode

The Safety Board believes that the guidance provided in Continental
Express’ manuals and training programs is clear in the description of the autoflight
system operating modes. These materials specifically state that climbs should be
conducted in either the &quot;climb&quot; or &quot;airspeed&quot; modes to ensure that an adequate
airspeed margin above stall is maintained. Contrary to that guidance, the captain
chose to use the “pitch hold&quot; mode. Moreover, the captain increased the pitch
attitude to increase the rate of climb apparently without reference or concern about
the performance capability of the airplane to maintain a safe airspeed. Consequently, the airspeed decreased, and as a result of increased drag, the rate
of climb decreased. That the captain’s action to select the “pitch hold&quot; mode was
intentional is evident from his postaccident statements and his attempt to increase
the pitch attitude in response to the flight attendant’s request to enhance the rate
of climb. The Safety Board is particularly concerned that an experienced pilot with
over 2,500 hours in the airplane type would fail to recognize the loss of efficiency
as well as the potential danger in selecting a constant pitch attitude climb. The
Safety Board believes that the captain’s action was not only contrary to company
procedures, but contrary to the principles of basic airmanship. Of equal concern
is the inaction of the first officer to question the captain or monitor the autoflight
system selection. The Safety Board concludes that the captain’s inappropriate selection of the
&quot;pitch hold&quot; mode combined with the flightcrew’s subsequent failure to maintain
a safe airspeed was the primary cause of this accident.</div>

which was followed within 2 seconds by a loss of Jateral control. Thereafter, the continued exertion of back force on the control column
was inappropriate. The airplane recovered from the out-of-control descent when control
forces were relaxed and the landing gear was lowered. The operation of the engines and propellers was normal until after the
loss of control. The captain shut down the left engine and feathered
the propellers, mistakenly believing that there was an engine
overspeed. Three of the four left propeller blades and the cowlings
separated after the beginning of the event, during the post-stall
gyration.

15. Following recovery, due to asymmetric aerodynamic drag caused by
the damaged engine, propeller, and cowl, the airplane was unable to
maintain level flight, and precise airplane control was not possible.

16. Because of the inability to precisely control the airplane after the
recovery, the flightcrew landed long. This, and the fact that the
runway was wet, precipitated the overrun landing roll, subsequent
airplane damage, and injuries.

17. The crew rest periods scheduled for the trip sequence were within
company guidelines and FARs. However, the crew did not take
advantage of the rest periods, and the combined effects of
cumulatively limited sleep, a demanding day of flying, and a time of

sn, day associated with fatigue were factors in the crew’s inadequate

judgment and performance.

18. Although coordination between Little Rock Approach Control and
Memphis ARTCC could have been much improved, it did not
contribute to the accident. ‘ 12. PROBABLE CAUSE

The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable
causes of this accident were the captain’s failure to maintain professional cockpit
discipline, his consequent inattention to flight instruments and ice accretion, and
his selection of an improper autoflight vertical mode, all of which led to an
aerodynamic stall, loss of control, and a forced landing. Factors contributing to
the accident were poor crew discipline, including flighterew coordination before
the stall and the flightcrew’s inappropriate actions to recover from the loss of
control. Also contributing to the accident was fatigue induced by the flightcrew’s
failure to properly manage provided rest periods. 13. RECOMMENDATIONS

As a result of its investigation, the National Transportation Safety Board
recommends that the Federal Aviation Administration:

32
Require that 14 CFR Part 135 air carriers provide aircrews, as part q\ f
of their initial and recurrent training, information on fatigue i

countermeasures relevant to the duty/rest schedules being flown by the
company. (Class II, Priority Action) (A-94-73)

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] Two
of these factors were examined on the EMB-120 engineering simulator: drag due
to sideslip and ice accretion. Drag due to Sideslip

The captain’s observation that the ball in the turn-and-slip indicator was
slewed full left and that the rudder trim wheel was trimmed 10 units right
immediately before the loss of control indicated that the airplane was in a left
sideslip as it approached the stall. The FDR lateral acceleration and control wheel
position parameters show that a left sideslip developed about 20 seconds before the
autopilot disconnect. However, as the airplane slowed during the climb, right rudder trim would
have been required to balance the normal left turning forces produced by propeller
effects at high angles of attack. At 140 KIAS, the airplane would have required
about four units of nose-right rudder trim. Thus, the sideslip resulting from full
nose-right trim was less significant than it would have been at a higher climb
speed. When examined in the engineering simulator, it was evident that the
reduction in climb performance resulting from the sideslip drag was less than that
encountered on the accident flight. Furthermore, because of the short time of the
sideslip condition, the Safety Board believes that the out-of-trim condition was not
a factor in the loss of control. Effect of Ice Accretion

The meteorological data and the observation of other pilots indicate that the
conditions present at the time of the accident were conducive to the accretion of
ice on the airplane’s aerodynamic surfaces, which would have affected
performance. The airplane was in clouds as it climbed above the freezing level
at 11,500 feet and was exposed to freezing temperatures and visible moisture for
over 7 minutes before the loss of control occurred. While the effect of ice on
aerodynamic performance is well known, the ability to quantify the effect in terms
of the lift decrease and drag increase associated with specific amounts of ice is

22

limited. Embraer had aerodynamic performance data available for a wing having
an inch or more of rough rime ice on the leading edge. When these data were
examined in the simulator, the noted degradation in the airplane’s climb
performance was far greater than the degradation evident for flight 2733. Although the captain and first officer both stated that they had not observed
ice on the wings, there is no evidence that they looked for ice at any time during
the climb above freezing level. The passenger’s observation of a whitish substance
on the windshield, which appeared to be snow, would be consistent with some
amount of ice accretion. The Safety Board believes that an accretion of ice on the wing is the only
reasonable explanation for the occurrence of stick shaker activation and loss of roll
control at higher-than-expected airspeeds.</div>

any reports of hail in the area,

Hail, having generally a lesser reflectivity to radar than other
forms of moisture, coupled with misleading information presented by a
higher than normal a.tc1..a up-tilt, could have induced the crew to
continue to press for &amp; ceviation to the west. We do believe, however,
that the fact that the crew knew that another Braniff flight, coming
from the west, was deviating to the east parallel to the storm front,
taken in conjunction with the repeated comments from the controller
regarding deviations to the east, should have been sufficient reason
for the captain of Flight 352 to reconsider his decision to penetrate
the weather area,

7 » . : a
ONE hog

After the penetration of the storm had been initiated, the
decision to reverse course was not in keeping with recomnended
company procedures for speration in areas of turbulence. Normally,
once in an area of turbulence, the crew is expected to maintain the
attitude of the aircraft as nearly straight and level as possible
and maneuvering is to be kept to a minimm until the turbulent area
is cleared. The possibility of gusts being added to control inputs,
and resulting in an upset, is a consideration that must be assumed by
the pliot. Because of certain apparent anomalies in the flight data recorder
readout, the Board analyzed the recorder readout in an attempt to
clarify the recorded data, These anomalies were apparent time reversals in the indicated heading and airspeed traces near the end of
the recording, They occurred during the short period of time following
the epparent upset and attempted recovery. During this period, the
aircraft was being subjected to violent and rapidly fluctuating accelerations. In addition, the heading and airspeed were changing very
rapidly due to aircraft maneuvering, and the heading trace was also
being affected by gimbal errors. Under these conditions, the advance
rate of the record mediwn can be very erratic and can even reverse in
direction momentarily. In addition, extremely rapid movement of the
styli can cause slight wrinkling of the aluminum foil. The aberrations,
in our opinion, invalidste the indicated advance or reversal of time
for this very brief period and also serve to confirm that the aircraft
was being subjected to extremely violent and rapidly fluctuating accelerations. There is nothing in this situation, however, to cause us
to doubt the validity of the magnitude of the recorded data points. The Board then analyzed the readout in an atteapt to define the
terminal maneuvers of the accident aircraft. This analysis indicated
that the aircraft commenced a 24° bank at 1647:10 and maintained this
bank for 10 seconds. During this 10-second period, a load factor of
1.1 &quot;g&quot; would have been required to maintained the 24° bank angle in
level flight. The centroid of the &quot;g&quot; trace peaks on the readout were
considered to be the average acceleration for the time period under
consideration and were determined to be 1.3 for the first 5 seconds
and 1.1 for the second 5 seconds.</div>

4 lightning strike might have ignited fuel or vapors without the ocSe currence of a catastrophic explosion was also explored. In this case
cle the failure of the wing might have resulted from heat damage to the
ae: stricture. This theory was rejected because it was not consistent with
the available evidence which indicates that no fire occurred before the
wing broke up.

ne A third possible effect of lightning was also considered. This was
a the possibility that a lightning strike, or nearby flash of lightning,
na caused the pilot to lose control of the aircraft either by temporarily
oO blinding him or by affecting his basic attitude instruments. According
to the statements of the witnesser who reported lightning, the flash
occurred almost simultaneously with the appearance of the fire. Our ae
analysis of the flight recorder readout indicates that the upset was en
- initiated about 20 seconds before tne failure of the wing, at which time a
elie the fire first appeared. Therefore, we conclude that the flash of
- Lightning, which was observed at about tne time and place of the appearence of the fire in the sky, cannot be considered in causal relationship to this accident. The Board believes that, as the aircraft approached the storm
system which lay across its intended path of flight, it began to
encounter moderate or slightly more than moderate turbulence. The
pilot corrienced a gentle bank to the right approxinately one-half
ninute before the in-flight failure cecurred. Within the period from
note ot 10 to 15 seconds after the initiation of this turn, the captain indicated

. a desire to make a 180° turn, a total excursion of 2.7 &quot;g&quot; occurred, and
the bank angle increased to a calculated average value of 66°, In the
next 10 seconds, the calculated average bank angle exceeded 110° and the
aircraft attained a descent angle of nearly 40°, We believe that the
t- aircraft was first upset laterally, possibly by a gust encounter, just

the as the pilot attempted to increase his right bank, and the lateral upset
ve progressed into a lateral-longitudinal upset or a spiral maneuver,

Pe, During the attempted recovery from this spiral, the inboard section

Sg in excess of its wltimate strength. Because of the effect of the rolling
a moment created by the attempt to level the wings, the left wing was not
Okigt- .2 subjected to loads as high as those imposed on the right wing. (i

Tne initial failure of the structure was a chordwise compression
failure of the right wing upper planking at WS 101. This failure was
a result of overstress of the material and, if any prior damage did
exist, it did not contribute significantly to the failure. The lightning stroke occurred at approximately the same time that the high
maneuvering recovery loads were reaching the ultimate strength of the
wing. ‘The ball of fire occurred after the integrity of the integral

the aircraft entered into first a lateral and then 4
longitudinal upset approximately 20 seconds before a
4.35 &quot;g&quot; peak was reached on the acceleration trace. At the time of this high maneuvering load factor, the
aircraft was in the process of recovering from the
spiral upset.

‘he recovery maneuver involved a left rolling pullout
from a dive. The failures of the outer right wing and empennage
were initieted by forces, accelerations or control
movements generated by the inboard wing failure. The left wing parts which separated came off during
the descending gyrations of the fuselage-left wing
contination. At the time of breakup, the flaps were retracted and,
during the breakup, the landing gear extended. The
right aileron was forced into the full-up position
when the aileron push-pull rod was pulled as the wing
separated. The breakup of N9707C occurred at an altitude of about
6,750 teet, 2,700 feet north and 800 feet east of the
initial impact point. Eyewitnesses did not observe the initiation or the turn
for the reversal of course of N9TO7C. None of the eyewitnesses observed N97O07C for the last
30 seconds prior to breakup. Eyewitnesses in the best position to have observed
NOT7O7G reported seeing it between clouds and then
disappearing into the storm,

These eyewitnesses support the air traffic controller
and Weather Bureau witnesses&#x27;s testimony that N9TO7C
entered the leading edge of the storn. Visual perception of the pilot might have been reduced
by a near lightning stroke. The reduction of visual perception or the startling
effect of a near lightning stroke should not have been
sufficient to cause over-control of the magnitude to
cause an upset by an experienced airline pilot.

(bo) Probable Cause

The Poard determines that the probable cause of this accident
was the stressing of the aircraft structure beyond its ultimate strength
during an attempted recovery from an unusual attitude induced by turbulence
associated with a thunderstorm. The operation in the turbulence resulted
from a decision to penetrate an area of known severe weather. 3. RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the Board&#x27;s findings of contaminated ‘hydraulic fluid and
corrosion of some of the hydrauiic components of the aircraft, the Board
recommended to the Pederal Aviation Administration that their Air Carrier
and General Aviation Inspectors be alerted to the necessity of constant
vigilance with respect to all operators’ procedures and practices in all
aspects of fluid handling. The Administrator concurred with this reconmendation and advised the Board that “our position is re-emphasized in

_ that the skies were clear with no apparent turbulence, Therefore, the
Safety Board concluded that inflight turbulence was not a factor in this
accident. Tho crewmembers of Flight 742 were properly vertificated, trained,
and qualified for the flight. There was no indication of any problem which
would have affected the performance of their duties. The Boeing 707 aircraft has been used for nearly 15 years. During
the early service life of the aircraft there were occasional incidenta of
longitudinal upsets caused by an encounter with severe turbulence. During
investigation of thoss incidents the longitudinal control characteristics of
the aircraft were thoroughly analyzed and tested. The findings of these
investigations led to minor changes to the airerale and to published turbulence penetration procedures, There was no evidence that the upsets were
caused by longitudinal instability. There have been two other instances of erratic pitching motions
which were not attributable to turbulence. Both of the aircraft involved
were found to have out-of-tolerance discrepancies within their longitudinal control systems. When corrected, both aircraft exhibited accept-

able flight characteristics. Therefore, the Safety Board concluded that the stability problem
encountered by Flight 742 was not one inherent to the basic 707 design,

N8705T was certificated, equipped, and maintained according to
requirements and regulations, The gross weight and c.g. were within
prescribed limits throughout the flight from Honolulu to Los Angeles. Although the circumstances of the July 18, 1972, accident were
somewhat different and the p’tching motions were damped in less time
than those encountered by Fought 742, there were definite similarities
in the entry airspoed, the peak loads reached, and the average frequency
of oscillation. The similarities are too great to be coincidental. Evidence
indicates a strong possibility that the longitudinal instability in both
accidents was caused by some fault unique to the longitudinal control
8ystem of N8705T,

During the postaccident flight tests, it was determined that the
magnitude and variation of the force cequired to displace the control
column to produce elevator trailing-edge-down deflections differed
from that generally expected by a pilot. The unusual characteristics
were most apparent when undesirably weak push forces were necessary
to counter aircraft noseup out-of-trim conditions. The low control forces were caused by the effect of a thickened
boundary layer on the left stabilizer which was produced by waviners
on the stabilizer upper surface combined with the step down at the stabi-

- Hzer-to-elevator contour fair. The control column force characteristics play a major roly in

determining the pilots feel of the aircraft and his consequent ability to

maintain stable flight, When the control column force gradient is low,
the slightest change in force applied by the pilot will reault {{n overresponse by the aircraft. Such response will tend to cause a pilot to
overcorrect any initlally sensed pitch disturbance.</div>

As a result of this accident, on October 18, 1973, the Safety Board
submitted Safety Recommendations A-73-76 through 78 to the Administrator, FAA. Copies of the recommendations and the Administrator&#x27;s
responses are included in Appandix E,

The Safety Board on May 15, 1974, submitted an additional recommendation to the Administrator which will require that the corrective
measures described by the Boeing Company be accomplished, This
recommendation is included as Appendix F.

_ This accident reemphasizes the need for improvement in tite design
of aircraft interiors to reduce the potential for serious injury as a result
of abrupt maneuvers or an encounter with inflight turbulence. Recommendations previously submitted to the FAA in the Board&#x27;s Special Study,
&quot;In-flight Safety of Passenge a and Flight Attendants Aboard Air Cartier
Aircraft&quot;! rd pertaining to seatbelt discipline, improvements in padding
of hard surfaces, elimination of sharp edges and corners, and imiprovements for storage of articles in overhead racks are relevant to the circumstances of Flight 742&#x27;s porpoising encounter.

{{a}} Findings

1. The pitching osctilation occurred 9% night during the
descent from cruise altitude and consisted of about
55 cycles with maximum peak to peak vertical
acceleration loads at the aircraft&#x27;s C.g. of +2.4g to

There was no evidence of turbulence in the area of the
accident. The crewmembers were properly certificated, trained,
and qualified for the flight. :

~ 21 -

The aircraft was certificated, equipped, and maintained
according to regulations, I

A waviness of tha upper skin on the left stabilizer disrupted the boundary layer onthe surface. The thickened
boundary layer was further disturbed by a step down in
the stabilizer-to-elevator contour fair produced by the
elevator hinge alinement, The resulting pressure diatribution on the elevator affected the longitudinal cont~ol
loads,

Critically weak push forces were required to displace the
control column and produce elevator trailing edge down
deflections which were necessary to counter aircraft
noseup, ont-of-trim conditions. The aircraft wae out-of-(rim when the autopilot was
‘disengaged. The light control forces masked the out-of.
trim condition,

The light control forces induced the flightcrew to overcorrect in response to aircy aft pitching motions and
initiate and sustain the longitudinal oscillation. The crew reacted properly by reducing power and slowing the aircraft. I

The &quot;fasten seatbelt&quot; sign was off before the porpoising
began, I

Unrestrained persons in their seats and those standing in
the aft cabin area were the most severly injured,

The injured occupants were repeatedly thrown from floor
to ceiling in an environment which included hard edges,
sharp cornere, and protruding surfaces, (b) Probable Cause

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] According to the captain, he reduced the throttles to flight idle well before he
extended the speed brakes. Consequently, the Safety Board believes that shortly before
2147:54, the captain removed his right hand from the control wheel and used his right
hand to retard the throttles to flight idle. Moreover, we believe that the aircraft was
then in a substantial sideslip condit‘on which, perhaps in conjunction with some relaxation
of the lateral controls or less than optimum le/t roll authority, caused the aircraft to
exceed its critical controllability parameters and to roll uncontrollably into a rapid
spiralling descent. As stated before, we are not ele tv fully explain hy the loss of contro:
occurred. However, we note that the foregoing explanation is consiste,.t to some degree
with the captain&#x27;s statements about his manipulation of flight and throttle controls. Also,
we believe that under the circumstances, after having apparently controlled the initial
roll to the right, it would not have been unusual for the captain to have diverted his
attention from the flight instruments to other instruments and controls in an effort to
determine the cause of the initial roll and the cause cf the continuing airframe buffet,
particularly since the other crewmembers apparently were nci aware initially of the
aircraft&#x27;s condition. As shown in figure 5, the second roll to a 35° right bank oncurred in about 4
seconds—a comparatively brief period in which even a slight distraction could have been
critical. At the conclusion of the 4 seconds, the roll was stopped for a few seconds which
indicates that lateral controls probabi,’ were applied quickly and fully in response to the
comparatively rapid rate of roll. Since the captain followed the application of lateral
conircls with a significant amount of rudder, as indicated by his statements, we concluce
that a sideslip condition was generated which placed the aircraft in a laterally
uncontvo. lable condition as evidenced by the resumption of the roll to the right. Further,
it is possible that cocking or deflection of the No. 7 slat added to rolling moment
imbalance at this critical point. Thereafter, the speeds and angles of attack generated by
the rapid descer* and high g-forees combined with the extenJed No, 7 slat to keep the
aircraft in an uncontrollable condition until the slat was torn from the wing. During the investigation, questions were raised about why the flightcrew might
have extended the leading edge slats under the existing operating conditions.</div>

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] According to flight tests, buffet begins and is shown in the g-trace about 2
seconds after the beginning of leading edge slat extension. Therefore, it appears that slat
extension began about 2147:32. Assuming © reaction time of 2 seconds to retract the
Slats, retraction would have begun about 2147:39 and would have been completed 5 to 6
seconds later. This would mean that slat asymmetry would have begun about 2147:40
_ which would have caused an increasing rate of roll to the right while the Nos, 2, 3, and 6
Slats retracted. Gimbal error calculations indicate that from 2147:40 to 2147:45 the
aircraft rolled from about 10° of right bank to about 35° of right bank at an increasing roll
rate. This is compatible with the increasing slat asymmetry that would have occurred
during that 5 seconds. Given the foregoing assessment of the aircraft&#x27;s motions and performance, it
is apparent that the aircraft was initially controllable following isolation of the No. 7
leading edge slat in the extended position because, beginning about 2147:45, the aircraft
was rolled to the left to a near wings-level position. About 4 seconds later, the aircraft
was again banked to the right about 35°. However, following a 2-second pause at 35°, the
eireraft resumed its roll to the right and it began to descend rapidly. The Safety Board is not able to determine conclusively why the captain failed
to retain control of the aircraft after having once rolled it from a 35° right bank to near a
wings-level attitude. Although we cannot positively exclude spatial disorientation of the
captain as a possible reason for his failure to retain control, we believe it more probable
that a number of factors combined to place the aircraft in an attitude where critical
controllabijity parameters were exceeded well before the parameters established from
subsequent flight simulations of the maneuver. These factors involve the actual
effectiveness of the lateral controls, the actual margins of lateral control with an
extended No, 7 slat, a cruise mach number tiat we believe was higher than 0.80, the
effects of sideslip induced by full deflection of lateral controls and rudder, and distraction
of the captain. It is possible, for instance, that because of aileron and spoiler rigging
tolerances, the accident aircraft had tess than specified left roll capability. Although
these tolerances would not have been noticeable in normal maneuvering flight, they could
have become a factor during full deflection of the controls. Also, it is possibie that
lateral control margins were reduced to values similar to those shown in figure 4, rather
than the higher values used in the flight simulaticns. The Safety Board believes that Flight 841&#x27;s cruise mach number at 39,000 feet
pressure altitude probably was higher than 0.80. Support for a higher cruise mach number
is indicated by a comparison of the airspeed and altitude traces with the captain&#x27;s
statements about mach number and airspeed.</div>

persists even though the CVR would not have contained any contemporaneous information
about the events that immediately preceded the loss of control because we believe it
probable that the 25 minutes or more of recording which preceded the landing at Detroit
could have provided clues about causal factors and might have served to refresh the
flighterew&#x27;s memories about the whole matter. 3. CONCLUSIONS Findings

1. The flighterew was properly certificated and was qualified for the flight;
the captain had requalified in the B-727 only recently, had flown 21
hours 50 minutes since requalifying, had not flown for about 3 months
before requalification, and had flown exclusively as a first officer on B747&#x27;s from November 1977 to December 1978. The aircraft was certificated and maintained in accordance with existing
regulations and procedures,

The inboard slat track T-bolt on the No. 7 leading edge slat had failed
predominantly in fatigue.

the right outboard aileron actuator hinge fitting bolt rib had failed
predominantly in fatigue. The wear pattern on the slat alignment hooks indicated that the No. 7
leading edge slat was not aligned properly. There was no other evidence of irregularity, malfunction, or failure of
the aircraft&#x27;s flight control, autopilot, hydraulic, or flep systems that
might have caused or contributed to 4 lateral control problem. The aircrait&#x27;s gross weight and center of gravity were within the
authorized performance and maneuvering envelopes when a lateral
control problem develuped. The aircraft was cruising at 0.816 mach in level flight and smooth air at
39,000 feet when a lateral control problem developed. A failure of the right outboard aileron actuator hinge fitting bolt before
development of the lateral control problem would have permitted the
aileron to float ucward about 1 inch; this condition would have required
about 13° of left \leflection of the control wheel to maintain wings-level
flight and would have been noticeable. A right roli and a lateral control problem were caused by isolation of the
No. 7 leading edge slat in the extended position. There was no evidence of any combination of failures or malfunctions in
the aircraft&#x27;s flight control system that would have caused an
unscheduled extension of the No. 7 leading edge slat. The Neos, 2, 3, 6, and 7 leading edge slats were scheduled to the extended
position, and the Nos. 2, 3, and 6 slats were retracted as a consequence
of the flightcrew&#x27;s actions. When scheduled to re-ract, the No. 7 leading edge slat failed to retract
probably because tensile forces created by air loads combined with
friction and side forces on the piston rod, caused by preexisting
miscasignmen* of the slat, exceeded the available hydraulic retraction
force.</div>

The aircraft was certificated and maintained according
to approved procedures. The crewmembers were certificited and qualified fox the
flight. The aircraft was near the maximum allowable takeoff
weight ‘init; however, the aircraft&#x27;s c.g. position at
takeoff was atout 3.? ins. aft of the rear c.g. limit
for flight. The flightcrew did not follow recommended procedures for
aircraft loading with eight passengers onboard. The flightcrew did not compute correctly the aircraft&#x27;s
c.g. for takeoff,

The estimated accident c.g. position was definitely
aft of the stick-free neutral point and probably at or
close to the stick-free maneuver point. Normal stick force-speed gradients would have been
reversed, that is, a reduction in airspeed weuid have
required a push force while an increased airspeed would
have required a pull force. Maneuvering stick force gradients would have been

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] Using che most favorable loading of the passengers and baggage,
140.09 ins.--2.09 ins. aft of the approved rear limit--is the most
forward c.g. which could be calculated. The worst c.g. situation--
placing the heaviest passengers in the rear seats--was also calculated,
A c.g. of 141.20 ins.~-3.2 ins. aft of the approved rear limit--would be
probable under these conditions. Therefore, at takeoff, the c.g. of
N631PT was between 140.09 ios. and 1/3..20 ins--2.09 ins. to 3.2 ins. aft
of the approved rear limit of 138.03 ins. The Sefety Board concludes
that, based on information relative to the passengers’ seating preferences
when flying, the actual c.g. of the aircraft at takeoff would have been
closer to 141.20 ins. than to 140.09 ins. This c.g. position cf 141.20 ins. resulted in flight characteristics which were both statically and dynamically unstable. The stick
forces which the pilot would have experienced in his attempt to control
the aircraft would have differed from the normal in such a manner that
his ability to coutrol the aircraft would have been impaired. While
pilot inpute tc initiate a maneuver or to change airspeed would have
Leen normal, stick force-airspeed gradients would he e been reversed,
that is, to stabilize the aircratt at a reduced airepeed would probably
have required a push force instead of the normal pull force, and to
stabilize it at an increased airspeed would have probably required a

&amp;

pull force instead of the normal push force. Moreover, the maneuvering
stick force-load factor gradient would have been essentially zero, which
would have resulted in poor aircraft control &quot;feel&quot; and a similar reversal
in stick force requirements for maneuvers off the trim speed. A stable aircraft, when disturbed from its trimmed fiight
attitude, will tend to return to the initial attitude without pilot
input. However, the unstable aircraft, with an extreme aft c.8:,
will continue to diverge in the direction of the initial disturbance
until the pilot reacts with an opposite frem normal control input. The
control forces required to stabilize the accident aircraft would have
been quite low. As a result, the pilot&#x27;s normal reaction to the situscion
would be to exert more force than necessary to stop the divergence. Therefore, a divergence in the opposite direction decones probable. The resulting pilot-induced oscillation could eventually cause complete
loss of control,

Although the pilot could, urder relatively favorable conditions,
modulate his control inputs to maintain a steady flightpath, the attention
and workload required tu do so might be compromised by the performance
of other necessary flight duties in an IFR environment. Any slight
inattention to aircraft control would quickly precipitate aircraft
divergence, which would increase at a rapid rate «8 airspeed reduced.</div>

allowable weight of 142,100 pounds,

Cargo rest-aining devices were not used,

Based on available aircraft loading information, the center
of gravity could have been at or aft of the aft limit when
loading was completed.

13. There was no evidence that the cargo was so tightly packed
that it could not shift.

14, The aircraft exhibtted critical stability characteristics,
as evidenced by the ebrupt rotation at lift-off,

15. The aircraft was rotated and flown in the area of reverse
commund, near the stall regime,

b. Probable Cause

The National Transportation Safety Board deteriuines that the probable cause of this accident was overrotation of the aircraft at lift-off,
resulting in flight in the aerodynamte region of reversed comnand, near
the stall regime, and at too low an altitude to effect recovery. The
reason for the aircraft&#x27;s entering this adverse flight condition could
not be determined. Factors which may have contributed to the accident
included: (a) Improper cargo loading, (b) a rearward movement of une
secured cargo resulting in a center of gravity shift aft of the allowable
limit, and (c) deficient crew coordination,

As .. result of the accident, the Safety Board on September 11, 1974,
fesued Safety Recomemiations A-74-62 through A-74-64 to che Administrator, FAA. On October 2, 1974, th» Safety Board fasued to the Administrator, FAA, an additional recommendation, A-74-84. Copies of these

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS AND CONCLUSIONS &gt; ANALYSIS] Therefore, the mechanical condition of the engines
and propellers was nvt related to the direct cause of the accident,

The consensus of the witnesses’ statements was that the aircraft
rctated abruptly to an unusually high pitch attitude and tat the short
duration level flight after takeoff was essentially flown in a similar
attitude and at a slow spead. Performance data indicate that with the aircraft flying in the inciplent portion of reverse command, there would have been no difficulty
in climbing. Instead, N6917C ceased to clinb after it reached an altitude
of about 120 feet. Therefore, the observed attituce of the afrplane and
its performance during its short fiight Lead directly to the conclusion
that it was flying deeply in the area of reversed conmand and near the
stail regime, In this area, drag at relatively low speede is significantly higher than drag at higher speeds during normal takeoff. Aa a
result, a point may be reached at which power available is less than the
power required to overcome the drag and maintain ‘evel flight, ‘To fly
out of this area, drag must be reduced by changing pitch attitude, power
must be added, altitude must be sacrificed, or a combination of these
corrections rarest occur. Under some conditions, these cor-ections cannot
ba made, or are not practical, and a descent cr a stall may be imminent. Such is believed to have occurred in the case of N6917C,

The Safety Bo2rd was unable to determine the reason or reasons for
the aircraft&#x27;s entering this adverse flight condition. However, the inquiry disclosed several areas, any one or any combination of which would
have led to this situation, Those which appear to be most pertinent are:

L. Improper loading or cargo shift, or both.

2. Deficient crew coordination,

1. Improper Cargo Loading and/or Cargo Shift

The possibility that the cargo may have been improperly loaded and,
consequently, shifted, thereby causing the aircraft to initally assume
and maintain a critical attitude behind the power curve was investigated
in detail. Considerable credence was given to the estimated gross weight
based on the captain&#x27;s Vy and Vy calculation:. This gross weight -~ batween 13C,000 and 132,500 pounds -- falls midway between the gross weights
calculated based on average cargo bundle weights of 42 ano 51 poucsds,
Therefore, the performance data that were based on a grot) weight of
134,524 pounds provide a reasonable basis for a discussion of the c.g.
aspects,

»
: ¢

a

Most of the evidence concerning the aircraft&#x27;s loading was incone
clusive, and in some cases, contradictory. Although the performance data

were based on a uniform distribution of the tree bundlas, it is more
likely that the density of the load increased toward tha rear of the aircraft, when it became apparent that closer atacking of the Sundles was
needed to accommodate all of them. Therefore, the actual c.g. may have
been aft of the calculated c.g. of 29.7 percent MAC, which was basad cu 4a
uniform distribution of 5l-pound bundles.</div>

Findings
1. The three-member flightcrew was properly certificated and qualified in
accordance with applicable Federal regulations and company requirements.
 
2. There was no evidence that any medical, behavioral, or physiological factors
affected the flightcrew on the day of the accident.
 
3. Weather was not a factor in the accident.
 
4. The airplane was properly certificated, equipped, and maintained in
accordance with Federal regulations and approved procedures (with the
exception of the flight data recorder (FDR) system, which was not functioning
properly at the time of the accident).
 
5. There was no evidence that failures of the airplane’s structures or flight
control systems contributed to the accident.
 
6. The compressor surges, or stalls, were caused by the airplane’s attitude before
impact; no significant loss of engine thrust occurred; engine performance was
not a factor in the accident.
 
7. The airplane pitched up quickly into a stall, recovered briefly from the stall,
and stalled again; recovery before ground impact was unlikely once the stall
series began.
 
8. The center of gravity (CG) of the accident airplane was near or even aft of the
airplane’s aft CG limit.
 
9. The center of gravity shift resulted in the airplane’s trim being mis-set by at
least 1.5 units airplane nose up (2.4 minus 0.9 units at 94,119 pounds).
 
10. The aft center of gravity (CG) location and mistrimmed stabilizer presented
the flightcrew with a pitch control problem; however, because the actual CG
location could not be determined, the severity of the control problem could not
be determined.
 
11. The mistrim of the airplane (based on the incorrectly loaded cargo) presented
the flightcrew with a situation that, without prior training or experience,
required exceptional skills and reactions that cannot be expected of a typical
line pilot.

78
12. Training for flightcrews in dealing with misloading, miscalculated center of
gravity, and mistrimmed stabilizers would improve the chances for recovery
from such situations.
 
13. Procedures used by Fine Air and Aeromar to prepare and distribute cargo
weight pallet distribution forms and final weight and balance load sheets were
inadequate to ensure that these documents correctly reflected the true loading
of the accident airplane.
 
14. The security guard was not aware of the airplane change, and he instructed
Aeromar loaders to load the airplane in accordance with the weight
distribution form he possessed for N30UA.
 
15. The accident airplane (N27UA) was initially loaded according to Fine Air’s
load distribution for N30UA; further, the final load configuration did not
match the planned load for either airplane.

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] These fuel cans were ruptured hy Iraulically, indicating that
fuel was in the ¢ans at impact. Therefore, since the fuel had not been
added while the aircraft was on the water at Twin Lakes and since only
one lauding is usually made on a flight of this nature, it is probable
that the pilot considered the fuel remaining iu his main tanks to be
sufficient for the return trip to Anchorage. In view of the above evidence and “he owner&#x27;s initial statements
that the aircraft had 6 nours of fuel on board, and s.nce the pilot knew
of the variations a sightseeing tour might take, the Safety Buard believes
that the aircraft was carrying more fuel than was assumed by the owner
in his postaccident computations. The telephone conversations between the National Park Service
personnel and Ketchum Air Service, Inc., regarding passenger weights
indicated conerrn regarding the weight and balance of the aircraft. However, there is no evidence hat the weight and balance was actually computed nor that less than a full load of fuel was carried on the flight. Although remote, the possibility exists that the pilot did not
use the rear fuel as soon as possible after all wing fuel had been used. If he did not, the c.g. would move farther aft and would cause the
control situation to worsen as fuel was burned off. With a c.g. near the aft limits, static stability decreases, the
stick forces are lighter, and stall recovery is more difficult.

~ ee

The aircraft&#x27;s 75° descent angle and 40° nosedown attitude
at the time of impact indicates that it was not under control or that
control had not been regained effectively before it crashed. Since the aircraft and powerplant were found to have been
operational before impact, the only remaining situation which could
have caused the loss of control of the aircraft would be passenger
movements or interference and airspeed bleedoff from an incorrect
flight control input while the pilot was being distracted from his primary duties. Passenger movement can be discounted since the passengers
were seated so closely together and any movement would have been
difficult after the aircraft became ai rborne. In addition, had the
passengers been moving when the aircraft became uncontrolled, they
would not have had time to reseat themselves and fasten their seatbelts. Rescuers found all the occupants in their seats with their seatbelts fastened,

The remaining possible cause of the loss of control is an

inadvertent entry into a stall as a result of the pilot&#x27;s failure to
monitor adequately his flight condition while being preoccupied with
other activities, If the pilot became engrossed in showing his pasSengers the scenery while flying a few hundred feet above the terrain,
he may have neglected to monitor the attitude of the aircraft relative
to its airspeed. After considering all of the evidence available, the Safety
Board concludes that the pilot failed to adhere to safe operating
procedures by allowing his attention to be diverted to the degree
that his aircraft stalled and he lost control at an altitude too low to
effect recovery. The Safety Board is concerned by the aircraft owner&#x27;s inadequate flight following and his late notizication of the missing aircraft.</div>

the belt indicated that the worn and frayed condition had existed for
several months, indicating poor maintenance and inadequate FAA surveillance. The investigation indicated clearly that the airplane&#x27;s langitudinal stability (balance condition}} was the primary event involved in
this accident. The airplane&#x27;s c.g. was considerably beycnd its aft
limit at the time of the accident. The airplane was about 4 percent aft
of its c.g. limit during the landing at Scammon Bay because the pilots
intentionally made the airplane &quot;tail heavy&quot; by loading most of the nail
and cargo from Chevak in the aft baggage compartment and by asking two
large adults to change their seats to the rear-most cabin seats. Moreover, they burned more fuel out of the forward fuel tank than the rear
tank. They did this to “lighten the nose“ for the lauding and takeoff
at Scammon Bay because of the muddy runway. However, the critical
factor was the removal of 278 lbs of mail from the nose baggage compartment at Scammon Bay with no other shift of payload. The c.g. change
associated with the removal of the 278 lbs in the nose equates to the
addition of about 500 lbs in the aft baggage compartment. Therefore,
with the c.g. already beyond its aft limit, the removal of 278 ibs from
the nose compartment without a compensating load transfer from behind
the c.g. resulted in an extremely aft c.g. condition. The Safety Board did not cetermine how the crew was able to remove
the aft fuselage tail stand with the c.g. so far aft. The weight should
have made the removal extremely difficult or could have caused the
airptane to settle onco its tail. However, since one engine was running, a sufficfently large nosedown pitching moment apparently was
generated by propeller thrust, compensating for the extreme aft c.g.
condition.

The flightcrew of Flight 517 supervised the loading and unloading
at Chevak and Scammon Bay. In fact, they actually loaded the cargo and
baggage into the aft compartment at Chevak and shifted some Scanmon Bay
and Hooper Bay cargo to the cabin. Similarly, they removed the mail
from the nose compartment at Scammon Bay. The pilots actually handled
al? of the mail and cargo, including the 256 Ibs of checked baggage and
646 lbs of mail loaded at Chevak, and they had the weight sheets in
their possession. Additionally, they made notations on the daily record
of the various individual weights involved, although their total gross
weight figures varied somewhat from the actual gross weight upon departure
from Chevak and Scammon Bay. Consequently, the Safety Board concludes
that the pilots of Flight 517 were aware of the weight and the location
of all the payload aboard the airplane and accepted the imbalanced condition.</div>

with the cargo from Camp Bastion to Bagram (the flight that preceded the accident flight); 
however, discussions between flight crewmembers and the loadmaster that the CVR captured 
indicated that at least some of the cargo had moved, one strap had broken, and other straps had 
become loose during that flight. The FDR data for that flight indicated that no unusually 
excessive G loads were encountered. Before the airplane departed on the accident flight, the flight crew discussed that the 
loadmaster was taking action to re-secure the cargo. The first officer mentioned that the 
loadmaster was “cinching them all down,” and the captain said that he hoped that the loadmaster 
was adding more straps. Although some of the discussion was conducted in a joking manner, the 
comments indicated that the flight crewmembers were concerned that the cargo had moved and 
that they relied on the loadmaster to know how to correct the problem and ensure the safe 
restraint of the cargo. The NTSB concludes that, although the flight crewmembers and the

NTSB 
Aircraft Accident Report 
51 
loadmaster were aware that the cargo moved during the previous flight, they did not recognize 
that this indicated a serious problem with the cargo restraint methods. 
2.2 Accident Sequence 
2.2.1 Loss of Pitch Control 
During the airplane’s takeoff roll and rotation, its performance and motions were initially 
normal when compared with both FDR data from its previous takeoff and a baseline simulation 
that assumed an airplane with a similar load and configuration. Although the entire flight lasted 
about 30 seconds from liftoff to the time of impact, the airplane’s FDR and CVR both stopped 
recording data within a few seconds after liftoff. The final 3 seconds of the airplane’s FDR data, 
which ended when the airplane had climbed to about 33 ft, showed that the accident takeoff had 
begun to diverge from both the previous takeoff and the baseline simulation, climbing more 
steeply. Recorded video footage captured the airplane in a steep climb with a high pitch attitude 
before it reached its highest point, entered a roll to the right, then rapidly descended and struck 
the ground in a nose-down and nearly wings-level attitude. The airplane’s steep pitch attitude 
and subsequent departure from controlled flight were consistent with an aerodynamic stall. 
2.2.2 Evidence of Aft Movement of the Rear M-ATV 
Debris found on the runway starting near the airplane’s point of rotation included 
fragments of airplane skin, tubing from hydraulic system No. 2, fragments of the E8 rack, and 
part of a M-ATV antenna; all of the airplane debris came from structures that had been located 
aft of the loaded location of the rear M-ATV, and the installed location of the M-ATV’s antenna 
was its rear, upper left corner.</div>

8 of which were unlatched. Thus, between three and five passengers were likely unsecured at the 
time of impact.73 If these unsecured passengers slid toward the back of the airplane during the 
pilot’s aggressive pitch-up maneuver, a weight shift beyond the aft CG limit could have occurred, 
but the available evidence was insufficient to determine whether a weight shift occurred during 
the accident flight. However, given the multiple unbuckled passengers, the last-minute boarding 
 
70 The term “acceleration,” as used in this context, does not denote an increase in airspeed; instead, the term 
denotes an acceleration in the vertical axis, that is, an increase in G loading. 
71 This evidence included the medical examiner’s chart depicting passenger locations at the accident site, which 
was the basis for assumed passenger locations in the cabin at takeoff. The chart indicated that a solo parachutist and a 
camera operator were found in the debris field near the aft cabin. 
72 The NTSB made this calculation using the basic operating weight of the airplane, estimated fuel on board, pilot 
and passenger weights, and parachute gear weights. OPC did not provide documentation of the company’s weight and 
balance calculation for the accident flight. OPC’s standard calculation method, which did not include the parachute 
gear weights (tandem parachute systems, tandem harnesses, and single parachute systems), is discussed in 
section 2.5.1.

of two passengers in the aft cabin, the possibility that the camera operators were positioned in the 
aft cabin during takeoff (because of their roles in capturing video of the passengers and 
coordinating the parachute jump), and the potential for a weight shift during the aggressive 
pitch-up maneuver, the NTSB concludes that the airplane was likely operated near or possibly 
beyond the aft CG limit during the accident takeoff. The accident airplane would have been controllable with a CG near the aft limit and was 
operated that way during previous flights. However, an aft CG reduces an airplane’s static 
longitudinal stability, which is a measure of the airplane’s tendency to return to equilibrium about 
its pitch axis. An aft CG also results in lighter control column forces that could cause a pilot to 
overcontrol an airplane. Flight test data from Textron Aviation showed that the Beech 65-A90 
airplane had acceptable control column forces for conditions similar to those involving the accident 
flight (CG near the aft limit, flaps and gear up, and maximum continuous power).74 Nevertheless, 
during the accident flight, the lighter control column forces (due to the airplane’s operation near 
the aft CG limit) could have resulted in an increased airplane pitch response and a subsequently 
higher AOA when the pilot moved the control column aft during the takeoff.</div>

flaps, the airspeed continued to decrease until directional control
could not be maintained. As the airspeed decreased to Vme, the angle of bank to the right
developed,

The captain probably feathered the left propeller by mistake as
the right turn increased and the indicated airspeed was Vme or
less. With the left propeller feathered, the captain was able to level
the wings after the aircraft started to descend. The captain did not configure the aircraft for single-engine flight,
and as a result, the aircraft did not have a climb capability after
the power loss. The captain should have been able to analyze the emergency and
determine which options were available and which emergency
procedures were necessary. A straight-ahead emergency landing was a viable cption available
to the captain after the power loss. Sufficient runway and overrun existed to land and stop the
aircraft with minimum damage. The captain was certificated and trained properly according to
regulations. The preflight preparations by the captain were {{inadequate
because the aircraft was over gross weight and beyond the aft
center of gravity limit. The captain should have realized that the passenger weight wes
substantially more tha the total derived from the use of the
average weight formuta. The captain was -equired to use actual passenger weights in
accordance with the operations specifications. The overgross weight/aft center of gravity condition made the
aircraft more difficult to fly, but did not contribute to the loss of
power or the options available to the captain after the power loss. The FAA office responsible for the surveillance of the airline
failed insure that the weight and balance program was modified
to meet the most recent FAA notices and orders.

91. The aircraft sustained greater vertical impact forces than
horizontal forces.

92. Most of the fractures received by the occupants resulted from
vertical impact forces. 3.2 Probable Cause

The National Transportatiw Safety Board determines that the probable
cause of the accident was a power loss in the right engine for undetermined reasons
at a critical point in takeoff, the aircvaft&#x27;s marginal single-engine performance
capability, and the captain&#x27;s incorrect emergency response to the engine power loss
‘when he failed either to land immediately on the remaining runway or to configure
the aircraft properly for the engine-out condition. 4. RECOMMENDATIONS

On August 8, 1980, the National Transportation Safety Board issued
safety recommendation A-80-68, which stated:

Require that only actual passenger weights [. used in
weight and balance computations for reciprocative engine
aircraft used in Part 135 flights which are certificated for
nine or less passengers. (Class WU, Priority Action)
(A-80-68).

The FAA responded, on November 6, 1980, that &quot;this was accomplisheu
on an interim basis by Internal notices culminating April 1, 1980. Final
implementation of this recommendation is by Advisory Circular, AC 120-27A,
Weight and Balance Control, issued May 14, 1980, and by internal instructions to
FAA airworthiness inspectors, which are under development.</div>

jumpers in their takeoff positions showed that the airplane center of gravity would be
very near the aft limit based on crowding jumpers in the forward compartment and jump
seat. Even so, they did not examine the effect on the center of gravity with the jumpers
moved into position for the jump. The Safety Board&#x27;s center of gravity computations for
the jump position show that the center of gravity would have been 16 inches aft of the aft
limit. Typically as an airplane&#x27;s center of gravity is moved aft, positive longitudinal
stability is decreased to a point of neutral stability. Further aft movement of the center
of gravity causes the airplane to become longitudinally unstable and the horizontal
Stabilizer and elevator to become less effective in controlling the noseup pitching
moment. When full elevator travel is reached, any further pitchup is uncontrollable. This
uncontrolled pitchup will cause an increase in the wing angle of attack until an
aerodynamic stall occurs, The Safety Board is convinced that the loss of control and
departure from level flight were the result of an extreme rearward shift in the center of
gravity which resulted in a noseup pitch which couid not be countered by full nosedown
elevator deflection. The position of the elevator trim actuator shows that nearly full
nosedown trim had been applied. This evidence, together with the descriptions of similar
incidents provided by pilots involved, corroborate the Safety Board&#x27;s conclusion,

The engineering analyses und flight tests performed pursuant to certification
of the Learstar modifications to the basie airplane did not investigate airplane
performance and stability at center of gravity locations beyond the aft limit. Therefore,
Stall speed and stall angle of attack for the airplane in the accident configuration are not
known. In addition, the actual effect of the handholds and step or the effect of a person

standing on that step on the effectiveness of the horizental stabilizer and elevator are not
known. However, the Safety Board believes that these tended to reduce stabilizer and
elevator effectiveness.

in previous incidents, pilots were able to recover to normal flight, even after a
large altitude loss. However, in this instance, the pilot did not recover. Witness
descriptions of the sounds indicate that the engines were prohably at hign power. The
pilot may have inereased power in an attempt to increase airspeed and fly out of the stall. If power was not reduced, it would have caused rapid acceleration and high airspeeds in
the dive. At high speeds and with the elevator trim nearly full nosedown, pilot inputs
required to overcome the high contro) forees were probaiply beyond the physical
capabilities of the crew.</div>

disorientation. See Benson, “Spatial Disorientation—Common Illusions,” 1999.

pull-up maneuver was great enough to overload the horizontal stabilizer downward and
the right outboard wing section was sufficiently loaded upward to sustain a permanent
bend in the spar. As soon as the horizontal stabilizer fractured and departed the airplane,
the right outboard wing loaded downward and separated from the airplane in a downward
direction. 
2.4
Loss of A.C. Electrical Power
Four possibilities exist to explain the loss of a.c. power aboard the accident
airplane. First, the selected inverter could have failed, and the pilot might not have
switched to the other inverter. However, the pilot should have been familiar with this
switch because it is always used to supply a.c. power after engine start and to terminate
a.c. power before engine shutdown. Second, a dual inverter failure could have occurred. However, it is extremely
unlikely that both inverters would have failed because of the inverters’ history of
reliability aboard King Air 200 airplanes.</div>

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] It is known that pilots have experienced spatial disorientation in
rapid transition from visual to instrument flight conditions, from sudden
encounters with marginal visibility, and in entry to rotational manevvers. In such cases, it has not been unusual for pilot confusion concerning
attitude and altitude to result. The various carments recorded on the CVR between 0222:02.3 and
0222:18.6 clearly identify go-around activity and a rapidly growing
sense of alarm possibly caused by the diminishing airspeed and vibraticn
as the aircraft entered stall buffet. The final ecement by the observer (0222:20.7) explains his version
of how they got into this fatal maneuver. His comment about the lights
could have been with reference to either the approach lights or landing
lights. In either case, the comment would be compatible with, and in
support of, conditions leading to spatial disorientation and possibly
to the primary reason for the pitchup and sustained climb,

Despite the difficulties associated with spatial disorientation,
it is difficult to believe that both pilots could sit through this
maneuver, particularly in the area of stall buffet, without somehow
realizing the nature of the prodlem. It can be seen that the copilot,
during the later stages of the climb, was occupied with setting the

_ go-around power and monitoring the flap indicator until the flaps were
positioned at 15° as ordered by the captain. These duties conceivably

- would have prevented him from monitoring the flight instruments and
thus detecting the nose-high attitude and precariously low airspeed.

-Why the captain did not cvercome his initial disorientation and,
at. least, lower the nose of the aircraft, unless he was temporarily
blinded by the aforementioned illumination, is more difficult to rationalize. Although the captain is considered to have been an experienced
pilot with a total company time of 10,973 hours, his total time in
CV-580 model aircraft was only 123:00 hours, all of which was accrued
stnce April 17, 1968. He had accrved a total time of 54 hours in this
type aircraft as captain, of which 46:19 hours were flown in the
previous 90 days. He had been released from high landing minima VU just 3 days tvefore
the accident. As previously stated, the captain had accrued 54 hours as
captain in the CV-580 which necessitased a substitution of 46 landings
to qualify him for low minimums and, thus, make him &quot;legal&quot; to conduct
this flight. His accrued instrument time in the last 90 days was 14:20
hours, an average of less than &amp; hours per month. It is, therefore, reasonable to conclude that the captain had
relatively minimm experience in the CV-580 aircraft, particularly
~ under instrument conditions.</div>

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] Such interruptions in the pilot’s instrument scan, as 
well as the introduction of head movements, would make him more vulnerable to misleading 
vestibular cues that could adversely affect his ability to effectively interpret the instruments and 
maintain control of the helicopter. These vestibular cues presented themselves as the helicopter 
banked and accelerated. At 0945:10 (about 36 seconds into the left-banked, rapid climb and about 13 seconds after 
the pilot pushed the IDENT button), the helicopter began to bank more steeply to the left, and it 
entered a tighter left turn that diverged away from US 101. The helicopter’s entry into the more 
steeply banked left turn would exacerbate aspects of the leans illusion and the pilot’s incorrect 
perception of the helicopter’s bank. Further, as the helicopter began to also rapidly descend while 
in the steep left bank, it began to accelerate. This acceleration was conducive for the pilot to 
experience a vestibular somatogravic illusion, in which he would incorrectly perceive that the 
helicopter was climbing when, in reality, it was descending.59 
The accident pilot’s lack of awareness of the helicopter’s actual flight profile was evident 
when, about 2 seconds into the helicopter’s rapid descent, he advised the controller that it was 
climbing. Based on the pilot’s declared intent to climb the helicopter above the cloud layer and his 
expectation that the top of the layer was about 2,400 ft msl, the pilot’s attention may have been 
focused on looking out the windscreen in anticipation of soon reacquiring outside visual reference 
once the helicopter emerged through the top of the cloud layer. As the helicopter continued in its steep descent, the pilot either was not referencing the 
helicopter’s instruments or was having difficulty interpreting or believing them due to the 
compelling vestibular illusions, and he did not successfully recover the helicopter. Thus, the NTSB 
concludes that the pilot experienced spatial disorientation while climbing the helicopter in IMC, 
which led to his loss of helicopter control and the resulting collision with terrain. 
 
57 Although the pilot did not declare an emergency, the controller’s actions to identify and provide service to the 
accident flight were nearly identical to the initial actions specified for responding to an emergency.</div>

pilot’s relatively short time flying in the local area suggests that his cognitive map of the terrain 
between Rudyerd Bay and Ketchikan may not have been as detailed or accurate compared to those 
of other pilots who had more local flying experience. Considering all these factors, it is possible 
that the accident pilot mistook the first mountain for the second one and turned the airplane west 
too early; such a mistake, in which a pilot does not recognize or maintain the desired position 
relative to the external ground and airspace environment is an example of geographic 
disorientation (Antuñano, Mohler, and Gosbee 1989). The fact that the pilot subsequently 
continued the flight straight and level at an altitude that would have been sufficient to clear terrain 
on the typical route (but was insufficient to clear the high terrain he was flying toward) further 
supports the possibility that the pilot was geographically disoriented. Thus, the NTSB concludes 
that the pilot’s continued flight in low-visibility conditions at a lower-than-normal vantage point 
in an area in which he lacked extensive flying experience reduced his ability to visually identify 
landmarks and resulted in a navigational error due to geographic disorientation. 
2.2.3 CFIT 
According to recorded flight data, the airplane’s final turn to the west occurred about 
half-standard rate; then the airplane continued on a nearly straight and level flightpath toward the 
higher terrain for about 30 seconds. In the final 2 seconds of the flight, the airplane pitched up 
rapidly, experiencing a vertical acceleration of about +2 Gs before colliding with terrain. The 
timing of the pilot’s aggressive pitch-up maneuver strongly supports the scenario that the pilot 
continued the flight into near-zero visibility conditions and, as soon as he realized that the flight 
was on a collision course with the terrain, he pulled aggressively on the elevator flight controls in 
an ineffective attempt to avoid the collision. Effective CFIT avoidance requires assessment of weather conditions and appropriate 
aeronautical decision-making in response to cues associated with deteriorating weather. The pilot 
missed opportunities to prevent the accident both in his decision to take the short route despite the 
presence of low clouds and obscured terrain, to turn toward an area of the lake where visibility 
was further reduced, and to continue the flight into deteriorating conditions rather than escape 
them.</div>

these risk factors were present for the pilot during the last minute of the accident flight. Attempts to continue visual flight into IMC may be even more problematic for
helicopter pilots than for pilots of fixed-wing aircraft because helicopters are inherently
less stable and require near continuous control inputs from the pilot. Helicopters, like the
accident helicopter, that are not equipped for IFR flight and do not have control
stabilization or autopilot systems can impose high perceptual and motor demands on the
pilot. These helicopters can make it very challenging for pilots to maintain stable flight by
referring to flight instruments alone. When the accident pilot attempted to continue visual
flight into IMC, he would have been subjected to a high workload in order to maintain
control of the helicopter. Moreover, the extent of the weather echoes and the duration of
the sustained turn captured by the radar track suggest that the encounter with IMC was Analysis

prolonged. This would have further complicated the pilot’s workload and increased the
potential for spatial disorientation resulting from hazardous illusions, thereby, increasing
the potential for inappropriate control input responses. In the absence of evidence indicating a mechanical malfunction, severe
turbulence,89 or some other factor that would explain the accident pilot’s apparent loss of
control of the helicopter, spatial disorientation is the most likely explanation. The Safety
Board concludes that the helicopter’s descending spiral flightpath, which became
increasingly erratic in the final seconds of the flight, was consistent with pilot spatial
disorientation.
2.3.2 Pilot’s Decision-making
Although the pilot likely encountered areas of deteriorating weather and IMC near
the accident site, photographs recovered from a passenger’s camera showed areas of
clearer weather along the coastline, east of the helicopter’s position, as it exited Waialeale
Crater. The lower terrain between the helicopter and the coastline and the height of the
clouds would have permitted a safe deviation in that direction. Furthermore, Bali Hai
pilots were authorized to fly as low as 1,000 feet agl from the crater toward the coast; thus,
the pilot could have flown in the direction of better weather, while remaining in
compliance with SFAR 71 and the certificate of waiver or authorization requirements. Rather than deviate to the east, however, the pilot chose to fly south, along his usual tour
route adjacent to Kahili Ridge, as the advancing line of clouds closed in on the high
terrain. The pilot’s decision to fly into an area of deteriorating weather and high terrain,
despite the availability of a safer route to the east, was an error that played an important
causal role in this accident, and the Safety Board considered many factors that may have
influenced that decision.
2.3.2.1 Inexperience with Local Weather Patterns
The accident pilot had been flying commercial air tours for Bali Hai on Kauai for
less than 2 months. Nearly all of his previous flight experience had been gained as a
military pilot with the Indian Air Force.</div>

The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of
this accident was the pilot’s failure to control the airplane while maneuvering because of
spatial disorientation. Contributing to the accident were the failure of the airplane’s

available to him on the instrument approach cluit and from his previous
experience in the Salt Lake City area, he should have known that 6,000
ft was well below the elevations of surrounding mountains. Therefore,
he should have snsisted on absolute certainty about where the flight was
to hold. When the approach controller issued the holding instructions,
he was not aware that cosounications and, therefore, radar control,
later’ would be interrurted. Consequently, the holding instructions were
imprecise and containec an ambiguity which the flightcrew failed to
detect.

8/7 The GPWS probably functioned becauseI the GPWS ewitch was found in
the normal position. Additionally, the rapid increase in the FDR
altitude trace and corresponding decfease in the airspeed trace
during the final 4 to 5 secs of flight, and the impact attitude
of about 15°, indicate that the pilot reacted sharply to:such a
stimulus.

~ 30 -

The Board has noted this lack of precision in communication in
other accidents 9/, and we believe that some of it is attributable to
complacency while operating in the radar environment. When under radar
control, flightcrew communications and adherence to prescribed procedures
may tend toward imprecision because they know that the controller has
the means to detect and correct mistakes. On the other hand, the coatroller
may be less precise in his communications and adherence to prescribed
procedures because he has the seans to correct any mistakes or misunderstandings that might occur. Consequently, after lengthy exposure to the
pure radar environment, both flightcrews and air traffic controllers develop
habits of imprecision in their communications with each other and in
their adherence to prescribed procedures. Further, the exposure can
lead to a loss of knowledge of procedures which, generally, were developed
for use in the nonradar environment or for use in the event of lost
communications and which may be used rarely with precision in the pure
radar environment. Flightcrews and controllers alike should consciously strive
for precision in their communications with each other and in their
adherence to prescribed procedures, not only to avoid events similar to
those which led to this accident, but also because the loss of communications
between the flightcrew and controller always terminates radar control
and prevents both parties from correcting mistakes or clarifying ambiguities. Another problem inherent in situations involving malfunctions
of aircraft systems in flight is the division of responsibilities among
members of the flightcrew while the malfunction is being resolved. The
Safety Board has addressed these responsibilities in a number of accident
reports. 10/ In this instance, because of the lack of CVR information,
the manner in waich the captain coordinated and managed the activities
of the first officer and the second officer is not explicitly known.

caused one or more of the capacitors fin the CAM monitoring unit to become sufficiently charged to back bias at least one of the transistors
in the preamplifier circuit. If this had occurred, the microphone
amplifier would have ceased operation until the excess charge dissipated. When the charge had dissipated, testing would nov have revealed the
probiem. Other than the CVR malfunction, there was no evidence of any other
malfunction caused by lighting in the aircraft&#x27;s electrical circuits,
including those circuits which involve the navigation and communication
systams. Although the pilots were unable to recat] lightning strikes
near the cockpit, it is possible that lightning might have had an adverse
effect on the pilots. If lightning had struck near the cockpit, the
pilots couid have been temporarily blinded for 10 to 20 seconds--a
sufficient amount of time for a pilot to lose control of an aircraft on
final approach,

The iow barometric settings on the pilot&#x27;s altimeters would have
caused the altimeters to indicate an altitude tower than the actual
altitude of the aircraft,

The condition of the captain&#x27;s altimeter when it was recovered
and the results of subsequent tests suggest that it might have indicated

ubout 500 feet too high at the OM altitude if the compensating pin behind
the balance assembly support had been out of position,

Howaver, during vibration tests, the pin could not be removed, which
indicates that the pin was probably displaced by impact,

Although the first officer made a number of references to altitude
during the approach, the flightcrew did not mantion a difference in
altitude indications between the two altimeters. &lt;A difference of 500 feet
would have been detected and challenged. Finally, no record of altimeter
malfunction appeared on the aircraft flight logs. Therefore, altimeter
error was not a factor in the accident. The captain&#x27;s flight director system was believed to be functioning
properly until the case of the flight director instrument was dented, which
locked the command bars in a pitch-down display, The aircraft was ina
nosehigh attitude about midway through the crash sequence. This conclusion
ig supported by the captain&#x27;s recollections and the impact damage to the
sycamore tree. Consequently, it is possible chat the attitude was near
oo° , whict. caused the command bars to disulay a pitch-down indication
of about 10° .

The flight was routine until it approached the St. Louis terminal
area. At that time, the flightcrew was aware that thunderstorms which
existed near the airport might block the flight&#x27;s approach,

After receiving information &quot;Quebec&quot; on th ATIS, the flightcrew would

Aircraft Accident Report 
39 
The first photograph showing the balloon flying over what appears to be an overcast cloud 
layer was taken 40 minutes after launch about 0738 (see figure 8 on figure 14). By continuing the 
flight in and out of reduced visibility conditions until climbing above the clouds where in-flight 
visibility was better but the ground was barely, or not, visible, the pilot greatly limited his ability 
to identify suitable landing sites and likely could not continuously see and avoid obstacles on the 
ground to safely land. Thus, the NTSB concludes that the pilot exhibited poor decision-making 
(1) when he did not land the balloon despite having had suitable opportunities to land safely in 
visual conditions and (2) when he decided to climb above the clouds. 
2.2.3 End-of-Flight Decision-Making 
 
The pilot’s position transmission to the ground crew 28 minutes after launch (16 minutes 
before the accident) was interpreted by the ground crew as the pilot’s normal signal of his intent 
to land. Passenger photographs taken about that time showed that the ground was visible through 
thin clouds, which would likely have allowed a visual descent to land. However, the pilot did not 
land the balloon. While the pilot’s intentions in sending the signal remain unclear, the NTSB notes 
that it is possible that the pilot did not transmit the position to signal his intent to land but instead 
sent the signal to the ground crew to indicate the position of the balloon after it had flown through 
clouds. If this were the case, he may have elected to extend the flight to meet passenger 
expectations of a flight lasting about 1 hour. Regardless of the reason for sending the position 
transmission, 12 minutes later, the balloon was over much denser clouds that restricted visual 
contact with the ground (see figure 8 on figure 14). 
Once in these conditions, the pilot had two choices: (1) continue flight over the clouds, 
hoping to reestablish visual contact with the ground or (2) descend in current conditions with likely 
visibility restrictions.</div>

Aircraft Accident Report
Statements on the CVR recording indicated that the pilots did not fully understand
the aerodynamic and performance considerations associated with operations at an altitude
of 41,000 feet. Specifically, about 2154:07, the captain stated, “we’re losing here. We’re
gonna be … coming down in a second here.” About 3 seconds later, the captain stated,
“this thing ain’t gonna … hold altitude. Is it?” The first officer responded, “it can’t man. We … (cruised/greased) up here but it won’t stay.” About 2154:19, the captain stated,
“yeah that’s funny we got up here it won’t stay up here.”100
Pinnacle Airlines’ ground school upset training addressed high altitude
aerodynamics, swept-wing design characteristics, and the use of performance charts. Also,
the company’s ground school performance training provided pilots with instruction on
how to use climb capability charts to determine thrust settings for altitudes above
36,000 feet. The CVR recording did not indicate whether the flight crew consulted the
company’s altitude and climb ability charts before initiating the climb to 41,000 feet. However, the Safety Board concludes that the improper airspeed during the climb
demonstrated that the pilots did not understand how airspeed affects airplane performance
and did not realize the importance of conducting the climb according to the published
climb capability charts. Section 2.3.1 discusses high altitude training for regional jet
operations.
2.2.2 Aerodynamic Stall and Upset Event
Even though the pilots recognized that the airplane’s performance was
deteriorating, neither pilot appeared to respond to this situation with urgency. The pilots
contacted the controller about 2154:32 and requested a lower altitude; however, during the
time that the controller was coordinating the descent, the airplane’s airspeed further
deteriorated to Mach 0.53 (150 knots), and the stickshaker activated for the first of five
times. Afterward, the stickshaker activated four times, and the stickpusher activated four
times, pushing the control column forward automatically.101 The flight crew responded to
the stickpusher each time by pulling back on the control column. These control column
inputs caused the airplane’s pitch angle to increase to a maximum ANU value of 29º about
2154:59, and then the airplane entered an aerodynamic stall. Afterward, the airplane’s
pitch angle decreased to a maximum AND value of 32º about 2155:06. While the pitch
angle was decreasing, a left rolling motion began, which eventually reached 82º left wing
down, and the N1 and fuel flow indications for both engines declined steadily to zero,
indicating that both engines had flamed out.</div>

was issued after the accident stated, in part, the following: “in the event that a stick
shaker/approach to stall occurs, the crew should expect that a deliberate loss of altitude
will likely be required to restore the aircraft to a normal energy state and to prevent an
aerodynamic stall and possible departure from controlled flight.” The Safety Board
concludes that, because most training for stalls occurs with the airplane at low altitudes,
the training methods may introduce a bias in stall recovery techniques by encouraging
pilots to minimize altitude loss and not fully recognizing other available recovery
techniques. Therefore, the Safety Board believes that the FAA should require that air
carriers provide their pilots with opportunities to practice high altitude stall recovery
techniques in the simulator during which time the pilots demonstrate their ability to
identify and execute the appropriate recovery technique. Another factor that might have contributed to the improper control inputs during
the stall event was the flight crew’s unfamiliarity with the stickpusher system on this
airplane. The crew would have been exposed to stickpusher activation during systems
training and the first-flight-of-the-day operational checks of the system, and, in the case of
the accident flight, the crew experienced the system’s activation during one of the pitch-up
maneuvers made during the climb. However, it is unclear the extent to which either pilot
120 At the time of the accident, Pinnacle Airlines conducted its stall recognition and recovery simulator
training at an altitude of 10,000 feet.
121 During that accident investigation, the Safety Board found that the flying pilot applied inappropriate
control column back pressure during the stall recovery attempt and that his performance of the stall recovery
procedure, which was established in the company’s operations manual, was inadequate. In its final report on
the accident, the Safety Board stated that the probable causes included “the inappropriate control inputs
applied by the flying pilot during a stall recovery attempt” and “the failure of the nonflying
pilot-in-command to recognize, address, and correct these inappropriate control inputs.” For more

standard for stall training was to initiate recovery at the onset of the stickshaker, which,
during a proper recovery, would preclude stickpusher activation.</div>

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] Even though the flight crew was eventually able to recover the airplane from the
upset event, the flight control inputs made during the upset were opposite of what was
required to recover the airplane. FDR data showed that the flight crew moved the control
column aft after the first stickpusher activation and that the crew moved the control
column aft with increasing magnitude after the next three activations of the stickpusher. A reason that might explain why the pilots made these flight control inputs, which
exacerbated the upset event, was that Pinnacle Airlines’ stall recognition and recovery
simulator training focused on recovery with a minimum loss of altitude (which is common
throughout the aviation industry). As a result, the pilots were trained to apply power to
restore the energy state of the airplane and to maintain altitude.104 In this accident, the
pilots’ inputs could have been the result of their attempt to recover using a minimal
altitude loss recovery technique, and, as the repeated stall events occurred with increasing
nose-down pitch attitude, the pilots could have been instinctively trying to arrest the
102 The Safety Board compared the AOA recorded on the FDR at the time of the stickshaker activations
with Bombardier’s stickshaker design criteria for the flight condition and determined that the stickshaker
activated at the expected AOA (about 7.8º) and airspeed (about 150 knots).
103 In December 2004, the FAA sent a letter to Transport Canada that recommended, among other things,
that Bombardier change “the airspeed tape display software to more accurately depict the top of the Low
Speed Awareness (top of the red band) at all altitudes and Mach Numbers.” In February 2005, Bombardier
indicated that it would include an appropriate design change the next time the stall protection computer and
the air data computer were modified and that, in the interim, its FCOM would be revised to provide
necessary guidance material on changes to the computation required to determine the low speed cue. In
November 2006, Bombardier stated that it had not yet scheduled the modification; in December 2006,
Bombardier issued the revised FCOM.

Board concludes that the pilots’ lack of exposure to high altitude stall recovery techniques
contributed to their inappropriate flight control inputs during the upset event. Section 2.3.2

2.2.3 Double Engine Failure
About 2155:06, the flight crew declared an emergency and asked the controller to
stand by. CVR evidence showed that the flight crew recognized the nature of the
emergency; specifically, about 2155:23, one pilot stated to the other, “we don’t have any
engines.” However, the CVR also showed that the flight crew did not begin the first item
of the double engine failure checklist (which is a memory item) until 1 minute 19 seconds
after the statement on the CVR recording about the double engine failure.</div>

the captain’s control inputs were consistent with a course correction to align the airplane with the 
runway. About 2 seconds later, the flaps returned to a symmetric state, and control input to 
counteract the flap asymmetry was no longer required. Immediately after the captain exerted the peak forces on the cockpit controls, about 
27 seconds before impact, the aural stall warning and the stick shaker activated for the second 
time, concurrent with the TAWS warning, “pull up. pull up.” Procedures for responding to either 
the stick shaker or the TAWS warning require the immediate application of maximum engine 
power; however, 2 seconds later, the captain reduced the airplane’s engine power to about 
10 percent torque, and he did not call for maximum engine power until 15 seconds later at 
0436:17. As the captain continued the approach, the airspeed again decreased below the 
minimum safe approach speed. At 0436:18, about 9 seconds before impact, the pilot began to pull back on the control 
column for several seconds. In response to the pilot’s pull on the control column, the pitch 
attitude, AOA, and load factor all began increasing. At 0436:19, the aural stall warning and the 
stick shaker activated for the third time. The airspeed when the stall warning occurred was about 
124 kts, approximately 19 kts below the minimum safe airspeed for the approach of 143 kts. About 2 seconds after the stall warning occurred, the airplane experienced an uncommanded roll 
followed by a series of roll, yaw, and pitch oscillations, which continued until ground impact. No evidence existed of airplane performance behavior consistent with an aerodynamic 
stall or with a loss of lateral control until after 0436:20. Further, no evidence existed of a sudden 
change in aileron hinge movement throughout the approach. The airplane performance study and 
simulations determined that the performance degradation due to ice accretion never exceeded the 
airplane’s thrust performance, nor would it have exceeded the airplane’s flight control 
capabilities if the minimum safe airspeed had been maintained. Therefore, the NTSB concludes 
that the airplane was controllable with the flap asymmetry and airframe ice contamination and 
could have been maneuvered and landed safely if the minimum safe airspeed had been 
maintained.</div>

2.3 Human Performance 
Under normal conditions, the approach-to-landing is a high-workload phase of flight for 
pilots. Required tasks include controlling, maneuvering, and configuring the airplane; 
performing final landing checks; and evaluating the airplane’s performance relative to the 
landing criteria. Pilots are expected to capture and prioritize critical information, analyze that 
information, and take appropriate action. Performing these tasks can become increasingly 
difficult as workload increases beyond routinely experienced levels, and, during the accident 
approach, both the icing conditions and the flap anomaly combined to increase the flight crew’s 
workload. Research demonstrates that emergency situations increase workload and require 
additional effort to manage effectively because of the stress involved, human cognitive 
limitations, and the lack of opportunity for pilots to practice these skills on a regular basis 
compared to the skills used in normal operations.95 The NASA emergency and abnormal 
situations study,96 which analyzed the NTSB’s findings from its 1994 safety study that reviewed 
flight crew-involved, major accidents,97 also noted that, during high-workload conditions, 
performance deficiencies, including narrowing of attention and impairment of short-term 
memory, could result from inherent limitations in cognitive processes and the effect of stress on 
human performance. Training, experience, and SOPs are developed to mitigate errors, especially during 
dynamic and high-workload situations. However, after the flight crewmembers recognized that a 
flap problem existed, they failed to follow their training and did not perform a go-around 
maneuver and reference the QRH checklist for the flap anomaly procedure; they did not comply 
with Empire Airlines’ procedures (outlined in the GOM) that address abnormal situations. As a 
result, a compounding situation unfolded in which the flight crew missed several opportunities to 
apply the correct SOPs to ensure the safety of the flight. SOPs are universally recognized as basic to safe aviation operations.</div>

                        <div class="chunk-text">[CONCLUSIONS &gt; FINDINGS] Had the captain complied with standard operating procedures in response to the flap 
anomaly, unstabilized approach, stick shaker, and terrain awareness and warning system 
warning and initiated a go-around maneuver, the accident likely would not have occurred. 
11. The first officer’s failure to maintain airspeed while acting as the pilot flying likely resulted 
from being distracted by the flap anomaly, the captain’s actions in response to it, and the 
control force inputs needed to maintain aircraft control. 
12. The captain’s failure to call out the first officer’s airspeed deviations resulted directly from 
his preoccupation with performing an inappropriate, nonstandard procedure in response to 
the flap anomaly. 
13. Although some of the airspeed bugs (including the internal bug) were not set to the 
appropriate approach airspeeds and were not reset following recognition of the flap anomaly, 
the flight crew had a sufficient reference to maintain the minimum safe airspeed because the 
airspeed for a no-flap approach in icing conditions was correctly briefed as 143 knots, and 
the red airspeed bugs were set near that value. 
14. Reliance upon flight crew vigilance and stall warning systems may be inadequate to prevent 
hazardous low-airspeed situations, and, had a low-airspeed alerting system been installed on 
the airplane, it may have directed the flight crew’s attention to the decaying airspeed earlier 
and provided an opportunity to take corrective action before the stall protection system 
activated. 
15. The first officer’s failure to assert herself to the captain and initiate a go-around maneuver 
when she recognized the unstabilized approach likely resulted from the steep authority 
gradient in the cockpit and the first officer’s minimal training on assertiveness; further, the 
captain’s quick dismissal of the first officer’s go-around inquiry likely discouraged the first 
officer from voicing her continued concerns and challenging the captain’s decision to 
continue the unstabilized approach. 
16. Role-playing exercises are essential for effective assertiveness training because such 
exercises provide flight crews with opportunities for targeted practice of specific behaviors 
and feedback that a lecture-based presentation format lacks. 
17. The establishment of best practices for conducting both single and multiple emergency and 
abnormal situations training needs to include training for the occurrence of these situations at 
low altitudes because low-altitude scenarios require rapid, accurate assessment of abnormal 
situations and appropriate prioritization of tasks. 
18. Although the risk for fatigue existed at the time of the accident due to the window of 
circadian low, the first officer took steps to mitigate the effects of fatigue, and her errors 
during the flight can be explained by her lack of experience in both the airplane and in icing 
conditions along with the distraction caused by the captain’s non-standard response to the 
flap anomaly. 
19. Due to the early morning hour of the accident flight and cumulative sleep debt, it is likely 
that fatigue degraded the captain’s performance.

stated that he was experiencing severe turbulence, it is reasonable to conclude that

experiencing severe turbulence, and inappropriately pulled back on the control

before the recovery. The flightcrew’s reactions to the lateral gust exacerbated the 
siruation 2nd led to significant pitch a d airspeed deviations and 
the unset of the airpiane’s stall warning. Because of the aft center-of-gravity (CG) position at which the 
MD-I i airplane is designed to be flown in high-altitude cruise, 
the airpime operates at lower longitudinal stability margins. Since ?here 2re no compensatory changes in the airplane’s pitch 
control system, control forces are lighter than for most 
conventional transport airplanes while performing comparable 
maneuvers. Consequently, a pilot is more likely to overcontrol 
the MD-11 airplane during recovery from a turbulence upsct. This overcontrol can lead to excessive positive load factors that

41 
can cause the aiqlane to enter stail buffet, and/or to excessive 
negative load factors that can lead to severe injuries to 
unrestrained passengers. 
1 1. 
Upon approach to the stall, the MD- I 1&#x27;s Longitudinal Stability 
Augmentation System introduces a nose-down pitching moment 
that requires a heavy control force to counter. The captain 
continued to exert back force on the control column and thus 
maintained a stall condition, resulting in further excursion into 
the buffet regime.

12. The stall buffet, which was encountered as the airplane 
approached and entered the stall, produced a dynamic load on 
the outboard elevators that resuIted in structura! overload and 
failure of portions of the outboard elevators. 
13. The elevator skin separation probably resulted from overstress 
produced during the stail buffet.

certification process. 
16. The pi!ots did not receive trainhg to aid in recovering from high

the light control forces encountered when marually flying at high

42 3.2 
Probable Cause 
I 
The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probabIe 
cause of this incident was the light control force characteristics of the MD-I 1 
airplane in high altitude cruise flight. The upset was induced by a moderate Lateral 
gust and was exacerbated by excessive control deflections. Contributing to the 
incident was a lack of pilot training specific to the recovery from high altitude, high 
speed upsets in the MD- 
I 1 ,

43 
As a result of the investigation of this incident, the National 
Transporntion Safety dozrd makes the following recommendations: 
--IO the Federa! Aviation Administration: 
Require Douglas Aircraft Company to advise MD-I 1 operators of 
the potential for damage to the composite elevators if the airplane is 
operared beyond the limits of the design buffet boundary, and to 
infom these operators that pilots might perceive the stall buffet 
(and subsequent loss of control) encountered during high altitude, 
high speed upseas as severe turbulence. (Class 11, Priority Action) 
(A-94-37) 
Require inspection. using nondestructive ultrasound &quot;A&quot; scan 
inspection techniques, of composite elevators on MD-I 1 airplanes

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] Higher density
altitudes result in a reduction of aerodynamic (wing and propeller) and powerplant
performance during takeoff and initial climb, and in a longer takeoff run and
slower rate of climb. This reduced rate of climb might well prompt a person who
was inexperienced with high density altitude takeoffs to raise the nose of the
airplane in an attempt to increase the rate of climb, thereby further decreasing the
airspeed. Therefore, the Safety Board concludes that the high density altitude and
possibly the pilot in command’s limited experience with this type of takeoff
contributed to the loss of airspeed that led to the stall. The Safety Board has been unable to determine which of the above
factors, or a combination of factors, resulted in the reduction in the climb speed to
below the stall speed. However, the Safety Board concludes that the pilot in
command failed to ensure that the airplane maintained sufficient airspeed during
the initial climb and subsequent downwind turn to ensure an adequate margin
above the airplane’s stall speed, resulting in a stall and collision with the terrain. The Safety Board notes that the pilot in command had limited
experience operating out of high density altitude airports, such as Cheyenne, and
that this should have prompted him to be cautious. He had expressed concern
about the predicted storm that was to move in from the west, and he had wanted to
leave early enough to avoid the storm. Further, just prior to departure, the pilot
knew the wind conditions reported by a pilot who had just departed. Accordingly, the Safety Board concludes that the pilot in command
inappropriately decided to take off under conditions that were too challenging for
the pilot trainee and, apparently, even for him to handle safely. Therefore, the
Safety Board attempted to analyze the human performance factors that might have
caused the pilot in command to depart under those conditions. These factors
include the possible effects of fatigue, the emphasis placed on media events, and
the desire to adhere to the programmed itinerary.

41
2.3
Human Performance Aspects
2.3.1
Fatigue
The pilot in command’s sleeping schedule in the days before the
accident flight may have led to fatigue. He received 6 ½, 6 ¾, and 5 ½ hours of
sleep, respectively, in the 3 days prior to the start of the trip on April 10, compared
to the 8 ½ to 9 hours of sleep that he typically received per night on weekends.41
On April 10, he awoke at 0330, earlier than his normal wake-up time. By midafternoon on April 10, during the fueling stop at Rock Springs, he told a witness
of being tired. After arriving at Cheyenne, he telephoned his wife and said that he
“was really tired.”
There is evidence that people tend to underestimate their level of
tiredness,42 so that when the pilot reported being “really tired” it probably reflected
a high level of fatigue.</div>

thunderstorm.

51
11. The pilot in command decided to turn right immediately after
takeoff to avoid the nearby thunderstorm and heavy
precipitation that would have been encountered on a straightout departure.
 
12. The airplane was 96 pounds over the maximum gross takeoff
weight at takeoff, and 84 pounds over the maximum gross
takeoff weight at the time of the impact.
 
13. Although horizontal in-flight visibility at the time of the stall
was most likely substantially degraded due to precipitation,
eliminating a visible horizon, the pilot in command could
have maintained visual ground reference by looking out the
side window. However, this could have been disorienting to
the pilot.
 
14. The airplane experienced strong crosswinds, moderate
turbulence and gusty winds during its takeoff and attempted
climb, and the pilot in command was aware of these adverse
wind conditions prior to executing the takeoff.
 
15. The right turn into a tailwind may have caused the pilot in
command to misjudge the margin of safety above the
airplane’s stall speed. In addition, the pilot may have
increased the airplane’s pitch angle to compensate for the
perceived decreased climb rate, especially if the pilot
misperceived the apparent ground speed for airspeed, or if the
pilot became disoriented.
 
16. The high density altitude and possibly the pilot in command’s
limited experience with this type of takeoff contributed to the
loss of airspeed that led to the stall.
 
17. The pilot in command failed to ensure that the airplane
maintained sufficient airspeed during the initial climb and
subsequent downwind turn to ensure an adequate margin
above the airplane’s stall speed, resulting in a stall and
collision with the terrain.

52
18. The pilot in command inappropriately decided to take off
under conditions that were too challenging for the pilot
trainee and, apparently, even for him to handle safely.
 
19. The pilot in command suffered from fatigue on the day before
the accident.
 
20. Information on fatigue and its effects, and methods to counteract
it, might have assisted the pilot in command to recognize his
own fatigue on the first day of the flight, and possibly enhanced
the safety of the trip.
 
21. The airplane occupants’ participation in media events the
night before and the morning of the accident flight resulted in
a 
later-than-planned 
takeoff 
from 
Cheyenne 
under
deteriorating weather conditions.
 
22. The presence of media at the Cheyenne Airport and media
interviews scheduled for the next two overnight stops
probably also added pressure to attempt the takeoff and
maintain the itinerary.

precipitation at the time of the accident was at least partly, if not totally, frozen. Therefore, to the
extent that the precipitation at the time of the accident sequence was frozen, the precipitation
rate, and therefore the loss of lift, would be less.

witness statements indicate that the turn to the east was gradual; this is consistent
with a bank angle of about 20 degrees. With the flaps at 10 degrees, a 20-degree
bank angle would increase the stall speed about 3 mph, from about 59 mph for
steady level flight to about 62 mph. Using the total weights of the clothed occupants, a full load of fuel,
personal baggage and miscellaneous items (food and fluids) plus the airplane’s
basic empty weight, the Safety Board concludes that the airplane was 96 pounds
over the maximum gross takeoff weight at takeoff, and 84 pounds over the
maximum gross takeoff weight at the time of the impact. The additional weight
would have increased the airplane’s stall speed about 2 percent. The combined effect of the rain, the excess weight and the bank angle
of the airplane could have increased the airplane’s stall speed to about 64 mph. The airplane’s best rate of climb speed at sea level is 87 mph (with a climb rate of
685 feet per minute). However, the high density altitude at the airport and the
overweight condition of the airplane would have affected the airplane’s climb
performance. The Cheyenne Airport has a field elevation of 6,156 feet msl. Taking
into account the temperature, the density altitude at the time of the takeoff and
accident was 6,670 feet msl. According to airplane performance data from
Cessna, the high density altitude and the airplane’s overweight condition would
have decreased the airplane’s best rate-of-climb speed to 81 mph; with a climb rate
of 387 feet per minute. Thus, the combination of the effects of the rain, the overweight
condition, and the gradual bank angle of the airplane would have increased the
airplane’s stall speed from about 59 mph to about 64 mph, and, along with the
high density altitude, decreased its best rate-of-climb speed from 84 mph to about
81 mph. However, the airplane should have been able to climb and turn safely. Thus, the Safety Board analyzed the possible reasons why this did not occur. These include a possible reduction in engine power from carburetor icing or an
over-rich fuel/air mixture, and the effects of fluctuating winds, poor visibility and
the lack of sufficient experience in takeoffs from high density altitudes on the pilot
in command’s ability to operate the airplane. As noted in section 1.6.1, it is necessary to lean the fuel mixture at
higher altitudes to allow maximum engine performance; an over-rich mixture can

38
result in an appreciable loss of power and reduced climb performance capability. The mixture control knob was found in the full rich (forward) position at the
accident site, thus suggesting that it was in that position prior to impact, although
it is possible that the knob was out and impact forces moved the knob forward
without bending the rod.</div>

traditional electromechanical instrumentation than with aircraft with “glass cockpit”
type digital presentation of flight information, the Safety Board could not rule out
their relative inexperience with electronic flight instrumentation as a potentially
adverse influence on their performance on the night of the accident. When the stick shaker alerted, the CVR established that neither
crewmember recognized that the airplane was about to stall. They failed to focus on
the airspeed, after the stick shaker alerted, and neither conimented on nor displayed
a recognition of the airplane&#x27;s precarious airspeed situation. The captain&#x27;s
vacillating calls for flap retraction further illustrate his unawareness of the airspeed
and the meaning of the stick shaker. Although it is difficult to explain how an air
transport pilot could not respond appropriately to a stick shaker, it is apparent that at
that point in the flight, both the captain and the first officer were unaware of
fundamental parameters and unable to anticipate the airplane&#x27;s flightpath. Thus,
they were &quot;behind the airplane&quot; and unable to plan and control the airplane&#x27;s
flightpath and to respond appropriately to the stick shaker. In summary, the evidence suggests that the combination of
inexperienced first officer, nighttime, restricted visibility in icing conditions,
inexperience on the J-4101 and the use of its cutopilot, and inexperience as a PIC,
contributed to the captain&#x27;s failure to monitor the airspeed, once the airplane was
established on the approach. The failure was most likely caused by attentional
narrowing as a reaction to the stress the captain experienced while flying the
approach. As a result, when the stick shaker alerted, neither crewmember
recognized that the airplane was about to stall, and neither appreciated ihe need for
the implementation of prompt and appropriate stall recovery techniques.

2.3 Pilot Training and Experience

The Safety Board reviewed the training received by both the captain
and the first officer. The ground training and flight training requirements met or
exceeded the minimum requirements as set forth in Federal Aviation Regulations. Interviews with ACA pilots and FAA personnel revealed that RTC had
well-qualified flight and ground instructors. Since the airplane was new to the
United States, the training facility was constantly modifying and making
improvements to the training program. RTC had a designated POI for the facility
that provided oversight for the FAA. He had not reported any deficiencies in the
training program for the J-4101. At the time of the accident, there was no J-4101 simulator available for
training anywhere in the world. The first simulator is scheduled for operation in
December 1994. As such, all training, at the time of the accident, was accomplished
in the airplane. Pilots interviewed stated that the flight training was excellent. The
company check airmen interviewed stated that the transition during IOE was easier,
since pilots had actually flown the airplane. None of the pilots interviewed
indicated that abnormal or emergency procedures that were simulated in the airplane
resulted in a poor learning situation or lack of knowledge transfer.</div>

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] About 2 minutes later, the
flightcrew of flight 291 requested and received 15,000 feet as a cruise altitude. Although air traffic control services at CMH failed to pass along a
PIREP of icing made by another aircraft that landed at CMH, that breakdown in air
traffic prucedures was not a factor in the accident. Consequently, air traffic services
provided to the flight, although not complete, did not contribute to the cause of the
accident. Conversations on the CVR indicate that the flightcrew was aware that
they were accumulating ice during their descent for the approach and that they used
the deice system to clear ice from the wings about 7 minutes prior to impact. They
discussed the accumulation of a small amount of rime ice on the wings before using

31

the “boots” to clear it off. About 35 seconds after boot activation the first officer
stated &quot;...little rime it never took nothing off this side here,&quot; to which the captain
agreed. The captain appropriately elected to conduct a &quot;flaps 25 ice AOA on&quot;
approach and landing. The flightcrew should not have experienced any significant
difficulties with the weather conditions during the approach and landing at CMH. The evidence indicates that the captain of flight 291 followed company
procedures until the point at which he initiated the ILS approach to runway 28L at
CMH. However, he did not slow the airplane in sufficient time to be able to
configure the airplane in a timely manner. After reducing power to flight idle to
slow to approach speed, the pilots failed to monitor airspeed, and the captain faiied
to add power as the airspeed approached 130 knots. The airspeed decreased
through the minimum of 130 knots for the approach until the stick shaker activated
because the airplane was approaching stall speed. The captain failed to execute a
proper stall recovery, and the airplane descended into the ground. Consequently,
the investigation focused on why the flightcrew failed to monitor the airspeed and
why the stall recovery procedure was not successful. Flightcrew training and
experience, company procedures, and FAA oversight of the operator were also
examined.

2.2 Flightcrew and Aircraft Performance

Although the ACA manuals did not contain a definition of a stabilized
approach, the ACA training manual did depict an approved ILS approach procedure
for the J-4101. The procedure depicts the airplane with engine torque at 30 percent
and airspeed at 180 knots before reaching the initial approach fix (IAF) and after the
approach checklist is complete. It suggests a speed of 160 knots during the initial
procedure with no flaps.</div>

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] The captain did not begin to configure the airplane for landing until 48 seconds after
crossing the SUMIE outer marker. At that time, the position of the airplane was
about 3 miles from the approach end of ninway 28L. The final landing checklist
was not completed until the airplane was about 600 feet HAA, and the airplane was
not configured for landing until that time. The autopilot repeatedly trimmed the airplane nose up to stay on the
ILS glideslope, which, in conjunction with the low thrust, caused the airspeed to
decay well below the minimum approach speed of 130 knots. ‘The CVR indicates
that less than 4 seconds after the captain stated, &quot;and autopilot to go ...don&#x27;t touch,&quot;
the sound of the stick shaker began, followed by the tone for the autopilot
disconnect. The airplane decelerated to 104 knots, which was 26 knots below the
minimum approach airspeed specified by airline procedures, at which point the stick
shaker activated for 3.1 seconds. Immediately after the stick shaker waming, the
autopilot disconnected, and the airplane started to pitch down at approximately
3 degrees per second. Waming tones (presumably from the autopilot disconnect)
started about 0.6 of a second after stick shaker. There was no dialogue heard on the
CVR until the stick shaker deactivated.

54

The evidence suggests that the captain was distracted by these events
and that he attempted to determine what the first officer had done to cause the stick
shaker to activate and/or the autopilot to disconnect. During that short interval,
when the captain was trying to determine what had happened, the stick shaker was
silent. There was no inication on the CVR or FDR data that the captain was aware
of the extremely low airspeed and impending stall because he did not begin the
proper stall recovery procedure. The captain asked the first officer, “what did you
do?&quot; The first officer responded, &quot;I didn&#x27;t do nothing.&quot; Commensurate with the first
actuation of the stick pusher, the power was partially applied to the engines. FDR data indicate that the captain applied nose-up elevator without
adding power. The airplane pitched up in response to the nose-up elevator
command, but the airspeed was too low to arrest the descent rate, and the AOA
increased to the point that the stick pusher activated. The stick pusher quickly
moved the elevator nose down, which caused the airplane to pitch down, preventing
a stall. However, FDR data indicate that the captain fought the stick pusher with
large aft (nose-up elevator) control column inputs. Engine power did not rise above idle until 5 seconds after stick shaker
activation and .6 seconds after the stick pusher activated. It then increased only
about one-half as fast as would be expected from a full throttle application. The
engine torque reached 50 percent 10 seconds after the first stick shaker activation. The captain then made a very serious error calling for the flaps to be raised to zero
degrees. The stall speed for zero flaps is about 11 knots above the flaps 15 degrees
stall speed.</div>

was not able to determine when or whether the stall warning horn activated on the
accident flight or if buffeting or loss of flight control effectiveness occurred. Nevertheless,
it is clear that the flight crew failed to monitor the airplane’s airspeed and allowed it to
decrease to a dangerously low level (as low as about 50 knots below the company’s
recommended approach airspeed) and to remain below the recommended approach
airspeed for about 50 seconds. Further, the flight crew failed to recognize that a stall was
imminent. According to the stabilized approach criteria contained in Aviation Charter’s
Turbopropellers Maneuvers Guide, while on the final approach segment of a nonprecision
approach, pilots should allow no more than a three-quarter-scale deflection of the CDI
needle and maintain airspeed within 10 knots of the approach airspeed. Further, according
to the Abandoned Approach procedure contained in Aviation Charter’s SOPs, when the
flight is within 500 feet agl, the airspeed must be within ± 10 knots of the recommended
approach speed. If the airplane does not meet these acceptable margins, the flight crew is
expected to execute a go-around. Computations showed that the airplane’s position
relative to the VOR course would result in the CDI needle likely at full deflection
approximately 2.6 miles from the VOR station. Further, at this point in the approach, the
airspeed had fallen to about 110 knots and was still decreasing, ultimately reaching a low
of about 76 knots. Therefore, the inadequate airspeed or the full CDI needle deflection
should have prompted the flight crew to execute a go-around.
2.3.3 Summary of Flight Crew’s Performance During the

Aircraft Accident Report
As previously discussed, simulations performed by the Safety Board indicated that
the later stages of the approach flown by the accident flight crew were more difficult in
terms of mental and physical demand and time pressure than it would have been if they
had not overshot the approach course and had not delayed their descent and landing gear
extension. The flying pilot of these simulations commented that during this approach there
was a “noticeably higher workload – with gear delayed, I felt behind the airplane.”
The flight crew’s failure to monitor the airspeed and correct their course and airspeed
deviations early in the approach and the fact that the flight crew did not properly configure
the airplane at the start of the approach would have made the later stages of the approach
more difficult.
2.3.2 Flight Crew’s Failure to Stabilize the Approach
As stated previously, the flight crew initiated a slight right turn at 1020:06, as the
airplane again passed through the final approach course (this time flying from north to
south) about 5 miles east of the runway 27 threshold. The airplane continued its slight
right turn until it established a ground track of 269°, which it maintained until the end of
the radar data. At this point, the airplane was south of the published approach course (of
276°); therefore, this turn did not allow the airplane to intercept the course, and the flight
crew never effectively maneuvered the airplane to remain near the approach course.82
At 1020:36, the airplane’s airspeed was about 156 knots about 3.7 miles from the
runway 27 threshold and it was descending through about 2,200 feet. At 1020:54, when
the airplane was 3 miles from the runway threshold, it was descending through about
2,100 feet and slowing through about 130 KCAS. The last two radar returns indicate that
the airplane was at approximately 1,800 feet83 and slowing through about 76 KCAS,
which is the approximate stall speed for the configuration in which the airplane was found
after the accident. The last radar return was about 2 miles southeast of the runway
threshold. Airplane simulations showed (and the stall warning system design indicates) that
the flight crew should have received at least several seconds of aural stall warning in the
cockpit if the airspeed decreased below 81 to 84 knots, if the stall warning system was
working properly, and if the airplane was not affected by ice accumulation. Further, the
flight crew should have had other indications of low airspeed, such as increased pitch
attitude and a quieter slipstream, and might have experienced buffeting and less
responsive flight controls, depending on the airspeed and whether there was any ice
accumulation.</div>

In sum, the Safety Board concludes that the flight crew failed to maintain an
appropriate course and speed for the approach and did not properly configure the airplane
at the start of the approach, making the later stages of the approach more difficult. Further,
the Safety Board concludes that, during the later stages of the approach, the flight crew

and to remain below the recommended approach airspeed for about 50 seconds. The Board further concludes that the flight crew failed to recognize that a stall was
imminent and allowed the airplane to enter a stall from which they did not recover. The Board also concludes that the inadequate airspeed or the full CDI needle deflection
should have prompted the flight crew to execute a go-around; however, they failed to do
so. Lastly, the Safety Board notes that if the flight crew had been adhering to Aviation
Charter’s approach procedures and effectively applying CRM techniques in the cockpit, at
least one of the flight crewmembers should have been monitoring the instruments. The
evidence clearly indicates that neither flight crewmember was monitoring the airspeed
indicator or CDI during the approach. Therefore, the Safety Board concludes that the
flight crew was not adhering to Aviation Charter’s approach procedures and was not
effectively applying CRM techniques during the approach segment of the flight. Analysis

Weather Issues
2.4.1 Clouds
Because the surface visibility around the time of the accident was about 3 statute
miles, the flight crew probably would have been able to see the airport to the right of their
course if the airplane had been completely clear of the clouds. However, EVM and
Hibbing surface observations and pilot statements indicate that around the time of the
accident, the cloud bases at and near EVM were somewhere between 1,800 and
2,100 feet.84 The last two recorded radar returns indicate that the airplane was at
approximately 1,800 feet and within 2 miles of the runway 27 threshold. Further, a witness
indicated that he saw the accident airplane “just beneath a low layer of clouds” but that
“the top of the airplane may still have been in the clouds.” Therefore, because the airplane
was most likely in and out of the clouds before the accident, the Safety Board concludes
that clouds might have prevented the flight crew from seeing the airport.
2.4.2 Airframe Icing
The Safety Board considered whether airframe icing could have been a factor in
the accident. Several pilot reports made in the vicinity of EVM about the time of the
accident and an analysis of those reports indicated that icing was likely occurring in two
distinct bands around the time of the accident: moderate icing was present between
approximately 8,000 and 11,000 feet, and light/trace icing was present between
approximately 5,000 and 8,000 feet.</div>

failed to notice, and the airplane remained level at 3,000 ft msl. As the first officer continued to slow the airplane, the captain made several comments about 
the airplane’s decaying speed. At 1449.41.3, the captain said “look you’re going one twenty. you

still at flaps 25°, and according to Execuflight SOPs, should have been flying no slower than 
VREF + 20 knots or 144 knots. The first officer’s speed reduction placed the airplane in danger of

the first officer interrupted “but why?” and the captain continued “because we gonna stall. I don’t 
want to sta--.” The first officer’s lack of awareness of his configuration and speed should have 
been an indication to the captain that the first officer was having difficulty flying the airplane in 
IMC and was not sufficiently familiar with the nonprecision approach procedures on the 
Hawker 700A to execute the approach safely. It was apparent that the first officer had lost 
situational awareness of the approach, and the circumstances were demanding more than his 
capabilities; however, the captain allowed the first officer to continue flying the approach. The 
NTSB concludes that before the airplane reached the FAF, when the first officer reduced airspeed 
and placed the airplane in danger of encountering a stall, the captain should have taken control of 
the airplane or called for a missed approach, but he did not do so. At 1450:21.6, the approach controller instructed the flight to change to the local advisory 
frequency. At 1450:39.8, the captain made a position report on the local advisory frequency, and 
at 1450:53.9, one of the pilots of the preceding slower airplane stated, “hey guys. ah we just landed 
on the loc. and uh broke out right at minimums (right at a) mile.” This voluntary pilot report 
indicated that the ceiling was near the MDA of 1,540 ft msl or 473 ft agl, and the visibility was 
possibly below the 1 1/4 mi visibility required for the approach. Since this visibility report was not 
an official observation, the accident flight was authorized to continue the approach.</div>

respond to the captain’s command to “keep going” when arriving at the MDA, yet he complied 
with it and continued the descent, indicating his continued loss of situational awareness on the 
approach and his sole reliance on the captain’s instructions. Execuflight SOPs for a stabilized approach required that a missed approach be executed 
if the airplane was not within a defined approach window when within 500 ft above the TDZE. The approach window parameters included a descent rate less than 1,000 fpm, an airspeed no less 
than VREF (124 knots), and the appropriate flap configuration (25°). Although the descent rate had 
decreased to about 830 fpm, the airspeed was too slow at 113 knots, and the airplane was 
improperly configured with full flaps. Thus, upon reaching the MDA (which was 473 ft above the 
TDZE), the airplane was not within the defined approach window, and the flight crew should have 
executed a missed approach. The NTSB concludes that when the airplane reached the MDA, the 
approach was not stabilized, and the captain should have called for a missed approach according 
to SOPs, but he did not do so. Rather than calling for a missed approach, at 1452:27.3, about 14 seconds after the airplane 
descended below the MDA, the captain said “okay level off guy,” indicating that he wanted the 
first officer to stop his descent. The captain’s instruction to level off was followed immediately by 
the sound of the stick shaker, indicating that the airplane was nearing an aerodynamic stall.55 
Analysis of radar data indicated that just before radar contact was lost at an altitude of about

9% above stalling speed. NTSB

1,300 ft msl, the airplane was likely in a stalled condition as indicated by an estimated airspeed of 
98 knots and an estimated AOA of 21°, which exceeded the critical AOA of 15.5°.56 About 
7 seconds after the captain’s instruction to level off, the CVR recorded the first sounds of impact. Further evidence that the airplane was in a stalled condition at impact was provided by the AOA 
indicator that was found postaccident with its indicator needle within the stall band. Leveling off required an increase in pitch and power to arrest the descent rate while 
maintaining airspeed. Because the flight crew had lost awareness of airspeed and allowed the 
airspeed to decay below VREF, there was little margin for error. Also, because the airplane was at 
flaps 45° instead of flaps 25°, the first officer needed to increase the power substantially more than 
he had during his training on nonprecision approaches to compensate for the additional drag due 
to the higher flap setting.</div>

flaps 45° instead of flaps 25°, the first officer needed to increase the power substantially more than 
he had during his training on nonprecision approaches to compensate for the additional drag due 
to the higher flap setting. Maintaining altitude and airspeed at flaps 45° required a fuel flow of 
about 1,150 lbs per hour per engine, which was significantly more than the 800 lbs per hour per 
engine that Execuflight pilots were trained to apply to level the airplane at the MDA when 
conducting nonprecision approaches at flaps 25°. Additionally, depending on the descent power 
setting, there could have been some delay between the first officer’s movement of the thrust levers 
and an engine power increase. The NTSB concludes that, when attempting to arrest the airplane’s 
descent, the first officer did not appropriately manage pitch and thrust control inputs to counter the 
increased drag from the 45° flap setting, which resulted in an aerodynamic stall. Throughout the approach, both pilots repeatedly failed to follow SOPs, which are intended 
to minimize operational errors; however, the captain was ultimately responsible for demanding a 
more professional and disciplined tone in the cockpit and ensuring the safety of the flight. Although 
the captain clearly recognized that the first officer was having difficulty flying the approach, he 
did not intervene either before the airplane reached the FAF when he noted the first officer was 
not maintaining the proper airspeed or after the airplane passed the FAF when he noted that the 
first officer was exceeding the proper vertical speed. Rather, the captain inappropriately adopted 
the duties of a flight instructor and did so ineffectively as demonstrated by his failure to ensure the 
safety of flight as he coached the first officer through the approach. The NTSB concludes that the 
captain’s failure to enforce adherence to SOPs and his mismanagement of the approach placed the 
airplane in an unsafe situation that ultimately resulted in the loss of control. 
2.3 Standard Operating Procedures and Flight Data Monitoring 
As previously discussed, the flight crew failed to adhere to company policy and neglected 
numerous SOPs in performing the approach. The crew’s deficiencies included the following: 
 The captain (the PM) agreed to brief the approach to the first officer (the PF), as 
opposed to the PF briefing the PM as specified in the GOM. 
 The approach briefing was not completed. 
 The Approach checklist was not completed.

2.2.2 Airplane Performance 
Security camera video indicated that the airplane was inverted in a 45° nose-down attitude 
during the final moments of the accident flight. Examination of the accident site showed that the 
airplane’s left wing impacted the ground first. The FAA’s Airplane Flying Handbook (FAA-H-8083-3B) states that an airplane, at the 
same gross weight, airplane configuration, CG location, power setting, and environmental 
conditions, will consistently stall at the same indicated airspeed if no acceleration is involved.70 
The handbook also states that an airplane will stall at a higher indicated airspeed when the airplane 
is subject to excessive maneuvering loads, including steep turns, pull-up maneuvers, or other 
abrupt changes to the airplane’s flightpath. This type of stall is referred to as an “accelerated 
maneuver stall.” 
An accelerated stall can be encountered when a pilot increases the airplane’s angle of attack 
(AOA) rapidly. Accelerated stalls that result from abrupt maneuvers, such as the pilot’s aggressive 
pitch and bank during takeoff, tend to be more rapid or severe than unaccelerated (1-G) stalls and 
can occur at lower-than-anticipated pitch attitudes. A pilot’s failure to immediately address an 
accelerated stall can result in a loss of control. The NTSB used the available evidence from this investigation to calculate CG scenarios 
for the accident flight.71 With one passenger seated in the aft-facing copilot seat and all other 
passengers seated in the cabin on the two bench seats (discussed in section 1.3.5), the CG at 
takeoff, for an airplane weight of 7,925 pounds, would have been about 156.7 inches, which was 
within the airplane’s CG limits and was the forwardmost CG that could have existed during the 
accident flight.72 However, it is possible that the two parachutists who boarded the airplane late 
(just before departure) were not secured and that one or both camera operators, who had a financial 
incentive to record video footage during the flight, were unsecured and moving around the cabin. Under these conditions, the CG would have been farther aft. The NTSB located in the wreckage the 12 lift-latch buckle assemblies for the bench seats, 
8 of which were unlatched.</div>

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] Because the pilot 
performed the accident takeoff aggressively, the resulting AOA likely exceeded the stall AOA 
quickly and with little warning.75 
Although the pilot’s previous takeoffs occurred without incident, the pilot likely 
overcontrolled the airplane during the accident flight while performing the aggressive takeoff 
maneuver, which caused the airplane to enter an accelerated stall at an altitude between about 
100 and 200 ft. The airplane’s orientation and trajectory at the time of impact were consistent with 
a sharp turn and loss of control. Thus, the NTSB concludes that the pilot’s aggressive takeoff 
maneuver caused an accelerated stall and a subsequent loss of control at an altitude from which 
recovery was not possible. 
2.2.3 Left Wing Anomaly 
Examination of the airplane after the July 2016 accident showed that the left wing was 
twisted, as indicated by the wrinkles in the top skin of the wing (immediately outboard of the 
engine and aft of the forward spar). The wing twist likely occurred during the July 2016 accident 
given the high airframe stresses that the airplane sustained.76 The direction of wing twist indicated 
by the wrinkles was leading edge up for the wing tip. Because the left wing was twisted in the 
leading-edge-up direction, it had a higher angle of incidence than the right wing and thus a higher 
AOA during level flight.77 This higher angle of incidence could result in a tendency for the left 
 
74 These flight test data were considered acceptable compared with the requirements of Civil Aviation Regulations 
Part 3, the certification basis for the airplane. The Part 3 regulation was established in 1956. 
75 The FAA’s Airplane Flying Handbook stated that accelerated stalls could “surprise an inexperienced pilot.” 
76 On February 1, 2021, the NTSB received a photograph of the accident airplane from the airplane owner; the 
photograph was reportedly taken in January 2015. Although the photograph showed the left aileron trim tab downward 
deflection, the orientation of the airplane in the photograph did not allow the NTSB to assess the condition of the top 
skin in the left wing. 
77 According to an FAA glossary, an aircraft’s angle of incidence is “the acute angle formed between the chord 
line of an airfoil and the longitudinal axis of the aircraft on which it is mounted.”

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] Another indication of the left wing anomaly was the position of the left aileron forward 
and aft control surface stops, which were found adjusted unevenly; the forward stop was fully 
extended, and the aft stop was almost fully retracted. The NTSB could not determine the reason 
for this control surface stop arrangement, but it is likely that maintenance personnel made control 
rigging adjustments to counter the effects of the damage that resulted from the July 2016 accident. The control surface stop arrangement would have affected the maximum rolling moment for the 
airplane in each direction but was likely not a factor in this accident. 
 
78 As previously stated, a still image from a video taken just before the accident flight showed the deflection of 
the trim tab on the left aileron. 
79 The application of left aileron and left aileron trim was needed to balance the rolling moment and reduce the 
pilot’s control wheel force, respectively. 
80 According to the FAA’s Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge, a stall margin “exists between the 
current AOA that the airfoil is operating at, and the AOA at which the airfoil will stall” (FAA 2016).

airplane, questioned the abnormal position of the aileron trim tab. NTSB

2.3 Pilot’s Aeronautical Experience and Training 
2.3.1 Initial Training 
The accident pilot logged his first airplane flight on April 22, 2017, and received his private 
pilot and commercial pilot certificates 3 and 8 months later, respectively. However, he failed the 
initial checkrides for both certificates and for his instrument rating. Although the accident pilot 
passed each checkride on a second attempt, his three consecutive first-attempt failures indicated 
that he was poorly trained and poorly prepared for the responsibilities associated with each 
certificate.82 
The accident pilot received his flight instruction from Riter Aviation. His flight instructor 
was the company owner, who also operated a Beech King Air C90GTi airplane as the PIC for a 
fruit company that had subcontracted its pilot services to Riter Aviation. During his initial flight 
training, the accident pilot logged about 53 hours in the King Air C90GTi airplane. However, this 
flight time was primarily logged as dual instruction while he was still a student pilot. The flights 
were operated for the fruit company and included extended cross-country commercial Part 91 
operations conducted with passengers in the cabin. Thus, it is unlikely that the accident pilot 
received any meaningful training during these flights and that the flights were most likely 
conducted by the flight instructor with the accident pilot sitting in the copilot seat. According to the FAA, 14 CFR Part 61 regulations allow a student pilot to log flight 
training and aeronautical experience toward a commercial pilot certificate; however, the pilot must 
be trained and evaluated at the commercial pilot level. The accident pilot had accumulated only 
4.6 hours as a student pilot when he began logging (and the instructor began endorsing) commercial 
pilot training and experience. A pilot with that amount of flight time could not be expected to 
consistently perform at the commercial pilot level.</div>

182 The airspeed at which an airplane would stall can be increased if the airplane experiences measurable loads 
(that is, variation from a 1 G load) because of, for example, maneuvering or external forces. The increased stall 
speed with loads greater than 1 G would erode the stall warning margin. 
183 Numerous combinations of airspeed and load factor can result in the stall AOA being exceeded. The stall 
warning margin that existed at the time of stick shaker activation was consumed by the increase in load factor 
during the pull-up maneuver, leading to the stall AOA being exceeded at an airspeed that was much higher than the 
1 G stall speed. NTSB

recorded on the FDR was about 25° right wing down. At that time, the airplane was pitched 
about 25° airplane nose down. The airplane performance study and simulations showed that the airplane experienced 
minimal performance degradation because of ice accretion.184 Specifically, the AOA at the time 
of the wing stall was about 1° above the expected AOA for a clean wing (no ice accretion) stall 
warning. Thus, the airplane could have been operated in normal flight, at the non-icing Vref, and 
with a substantial margin remaining above the actual point of stall. As a result, the NTSB 
concludes that the minimal aircraft performance degradation resulting from ice accumulation did 
not affect the flight crew’s ability to fly and control the airplane. The flight crew’s actions during 
the accident sequence are further discussed in sections 2.2.2 through 2.2.4. 
2.2.2 
Approach to Airport 
The approach phase of flight is dynamic and requires heightened vigilance because it 
typically involves changes in the airplane’s altitude, heading, speed, and configuration. The 
captain, as the flying pilot, had the primary responsibility to monitor the instruments, and the 
first officer, as the monitoring pilot, was responsible for providing backup and corrective input to 
the captain’s efforts. About 2215:14, the controller informed the flight crew that the airplane was 3 miles from 
the outer marker and cleared the flight for the ILS runway 23 approach. The glideslope intercept 
point, as shown on the approach chart, was outside the outer marker. According to Colgan’s 
guidance, the airspeed at the time (184 knots) was too fast for the airplane’s position relative to 
the glideslope;185 as a result, the captain needed to initiate a rapid slowdown less than 3 miles 
from the outer marker. ATC requirements at busy airports, such as EWR (where both pilots were 
based), often necessitate such a maneuver.</div>

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] Variable periods of snow and light-to-moderate icing were present during the accident 
airplane’s approach to BUF, and some ice accumulation was likely present on the airplane. However, FDR data and airplane performance models showed that the airplane responded to 
control inputs as expected, given the calculated ice accretion at the time, until the wing stalled. The CVR recorded the activation of the stick shaker about 2216:27, and FDR data 
showed that the activation occurred at an AOA of about 8°, a load factor of 1 G, and an airspeed 
of 131 knots, which was consistent with the AOA, airspeed, and low-speed cue during normal 
operations when the ref speeds switch was selected to the increase position. The airplane was not 
close to stalling at the time. However, because the ref speeds switch was selected to the increase 
(icing conditions) position, the stall warning occurred at an airspeed that was 15 knots higher 
than would be expected for a Q400 in a clean (no ice accretion) configuration. Stick shakers 
generally provide pilots with a 5- to 7-knot warning of an impending stall; thus, as a result of the 
15-knot increase from the ref speeds switch, the accident flight crew had a 20- to 22-knot 
warning of a potential stall.182 
CVR and FDR data indicated that, when the stick shaker activated, the autopilot 
disconnected automatically. The captain responded by applying a 37-pound pull force to the 
control column, which resulted in an airplane-nose-up elevator deflection, and adding power. In 
response to the aft control column movement, the AOA increased to 13°, pitch attitude increased 
to about 18°, load factor increased from 1.0 to about 1.4 Gs, and airspeed slowed to 125 knots. In 
addition, the speed at which a stall would occur increased.183 The airflow over the wing 
separated as the stall AOA was exceeded, leading to an aerodynamic stall and a left-wing-down 
roll that eventually reached 45°, despite opposing flight control inputs. Thus, the NTSB 
concludes that the captain’s inappropriate aft control column inputs in response to the stick 
shaker caused the airplane’s wing to stall. The airplane experienced several roll oscillations during the wing aerodynamic stall. FDR data showed that, after the roll angle had reached 45° left wing down, the airplane rolled 
back to the right through wings level. After the first stick pusher activation, the captain applied a 
41-pound pull force to the control column, and the roll angle reached 105° right wing down. After the second stick pusher activation, the captain applied a 90-pound pull force, and the roll 
angle reached about 35° left wing down and then 100° right wing down. After the third stick 
pusher activation, the captain applied a 160-pound pull force.</div>

no procedures were in place to ensure that the selected airspeeds were above the top of the lowspeed cue. For example, if the captain and the first officer had recalled that the switch was set to 
the increase position, then they should have recognized that the airspeed for the approach needed 
to increase by 20 knots. Additional information on Colgan’s airspeed selection procedures is 
discussed in section 2.8, along with the company’s postaccident changes to these procedures. 
2.2.3 
Response to Stick Shaker Activation 
After the stick shaker activated, the autopilot disconnected automatically, as designed. The airplane was not in an aerodynamic stall at that time. The stick shaker activated with enough 
airspeed available to correct the situation because the wings were level and the load factor was 1 
G. However, as stated previously, the captain’s inappropriate aft control column inputs in 
response to the stick shaker led to an aerodynamic stall. CVR and FDR data showed that the captain made an initial aft control column input after 
stick shaker onset and before the application of power. The stick forces at the time of autopilot 
disconnect were likely less than 2 pounds and would not account for his control input, which was 
 
194 The CVR recorded the captain stating that the 24-hour ice protection check had been accomplished. The 
first officer subsequently confirmed that the check had been performed after she noticed in the airplane’s logbooks 
that a previous flight crew had not completed the daily check. 
195 In addition, if the ref speeds switch was in the off position, the ice detected message on the engine display 
would appear in flashing yellow letters, which would have provided the pilots with information about the mismatch 
between the position of the ref speeds switch and the airspeed bugs. 
196 When the event occurred, the airplane was not under autopilot control. The captain, who was the flying 
pilot, reported that she had been looking outside for the runway when the stick shaker activated, and the first officer 
reported that he had been performing a checklist at the time. The captain successfully recovered the airplane, and 
the flight continued to a landing without further incident. NTSB

3. CONCLUSIONS 3.1
Findings
1.
The pilot flying made a timely decision to terminate the clean stall
and begin the stall recovery.
2.
The pilot flying applied inappropriate control column back
pressure during the stall recovery attempt in an inadequate
performance of the stall recovery procedure established in ABX’s
operations manual.
3.
Aircraft weight and balance were not a factor in the greater-thanexpected buffet onset speed; and the airplane was loaded within its
approved weight and balance limits during the accident flight.
4.
Some combination of airframe icing, flight control rigging, or other
factors resulted in the greater-than-expected buffet onset speed;
however, any effects of airframe icing or flight control rigging
upon the stall speed of the accident airplane were minimal.
5. 
Although the pilot flying trimmed the airplane below the
recommended minimum trim speed for the clean stall, this action
did not contribute to the accident.
6.
The pilot not flying, in the right seat, was serving as the pilot-incommand of the accident flight and was conducting instruction in
functional evaluation flight procedures; and the pilot flying, in the
left seat, was serving as the second-in-command and was receiving
instruction in functional evaluation flight maneuvers, including the
clean stall maneuver.
7.
The pilot not flying, as the pilot-in-command, failed to recognize,
address and correct the pilot flying’s inappropriate control inputs.
8.
The absence of the stick shaker prior to the stall did not affect the
flightcrew’s recognition of the initial entry into the stall.
9.
The inoperative stall warning system failed to reinforce to the
flightcrew the indications that the airplane was in a full stall during
the recovery attempt.
10. This accident might have been prevented if the flightcrew had been
provided a clear, direct indication of the airplane’s angle of attack.

49
11. The engine compressor surges in the No. 2 engine (caused by
airflow disruption) may have distracted the flightcrew during the
critical early period of the stall recovery, when sufficient lateral
control was available for the recovery.
12. The flightcrew did not have a clearly visible natural horizon
because of darkness and clouds above and below the airplane, and
the airplane most likely encountered instrument meteorological
conditions soon after descending through 13,500 feet and remained
in instrument meteorological conditions until just before impacting
terrain.
13. By conducting these maneuvers without a visible natural horizon,
the flightcrew was deprived of an important flight attitude
reference that would have aided in their recovery from a full stall.
14. The flightcrew’s exposure to a low fidelity reproduction of the DC8’s stall characteristics in the ABX DC-8 flight training simulator
was a factor in the pilot flying holding aft (stall-inducing) control
column inputs when the airplane began to pitch down and roll.

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] FDR data on the performance of the
airplane during its takeoff on the accident flight were consistent with the flightcrew’s
calculations of the airplane’s weight and stall speed. Therefore, the Safety Board concludes that
aircraft weight and balance were not a factor in the greater-than-expected buffet onset speed. Further, based on the Safety Board’s estimates of weight and balance for the accident flight,
which were developed using ABX records of the basic operating weight of N827AX and the fuel
weight remaining after the December 21 FEF, the Safety Board concludes that the airplane was
loaded within its approved weight and balance limits during the accident flight. The flight had been operating at least intermittently in the cloud tops and belowfreezing air temperatures, where weather conditions were conducive to light-to-moderate icing
for a brief period before the attempted stall maneuver. The flightcrew’s statements on the CVR,
at 1748:34, indicate that the airplane was accumulating airframe ice. Recorded comments of the
flightcrew further indicated that the airplane departed from the icing conditions shortly thereafter. The Safety Board was unable to determine the amount of airframe ice that the airplane would
have accumulated during this period. However, airframe icing could have caused the airplane to
buffet at a greater airspeed than the flightcrew expected. The buffet and stall speeds also could have been affected by the rigging of the
airplane’s flap and aileron control surfaces. These control surfaces had been re-rigged prior to
the FEFs of December 21 and 22, 1996, as a routine part of the overhaul of N827AX. One of the
purposes of performing the stall series during the post-modification FEF was to verify that
control surface rigging was proper by comparing calculated stick shaker activation and stall
speeds to the airspeeds at which the airplane actually encountered these events.
 
32Stall speed is an increasing function of an airplane’s weight. An accumulation of ice on the lift-producing surfaces
of an airplane can increase the stall speed by altering the shape of these surfaces. A control surface that is rigged at
or beyond the forward (retracted) tolerance limit decreases the airplane’s wing area and the camber (curvature) of the
wing, increasing the stall speed. Also possibly affecting the stall speed are load factor (vertical G), aileron
deflection, spoiler deflection, sideslip, and smoothness of the wing leading edge.

34
Consequently, like airframe icing, variations in flap and aileron rigging could
have caused the airplane to buffet at a greater airspeed than expected. The Safety Board was
unable to determine the extent to which these possible conditions individually contributed to the
early onset of buffet, but concludes that some combination of airframe icing, flight control
rigging, or other factors resulted in the greater-than-expected buffet onset speed.</div>

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] Based on the thrust application and the “Set max power”
statement of the PF, the Safety Board concludes that the PF made a timely decision to terminate
the clean stall and begin the stall recovery. For 8 seconds following the initiation of the stall recovery, from 1808:13 through
1808:21, the PF maintained the airplane’s pitch attitude at between 10 degrees and 14 degrees
ANU. During this 8-second period, the airspeed continued to decrease and the airplane entered a
fully developed stall. The failure of the airplane to recover before entering the full stall resulted from
the control column inputs the PF was making to maintain pitch attitude. The control column was
moved aft by the PF, from 5 degrees aft (at 1808:11, just prior to initiating the recovery) to 20
degrees aft (14 seconds later). An increasingly downward flightpath angle coupled with a
relatively constant pitch angle resulted in an increasing angle of attack. The increase in angle of
attack, which placed the airplane farther into the stalled condition, may not have been perceived
by the flightcrew unless they were closely monitoring the airspeed indicator. In addition, the
vertical speed indicator and altimeter should have provided evidence of a developing sink rate
and stall. Thereafter, the airplane began a series of roll reversals, and the airplane remained
in an aerodynamic stall condition because the PF held significant back pressure on the control
column all the way to impact. Each time the airplane developed a large nose-down pitch rate
(combined with reductions in airspeed at 1808:25 and 1809:22), the PF responded with
additional back pressure, according to FDR data on control column movement. In contrast, the
appropriate pilot response to an uncommanded decrease in pitch attitude (which is, itself, an
indication that the airplane is in a stall) would have been forward movement of the control
column.31
ABX’s stall recovery procedures, established in accordance with FAA standards,
were used to train line flightcrews to recognize an impending stall and perform a recovery with a
minimum loss of altitude. The training procedures call for the airplane to be slowly decelerated
at a constant altitude until stall recognition; i.e., the onset of a pre-stall buffet or activation of the
stick shaker. Recovery is executed by adding power, reducing pitch attitude slightly (until the
stick shaker stops) and maintaining heading. Evaluation criteria for the performance of this
maneuver by line flightcrews during proficiency checks include minimum altitude loss and
avoidance of a secondary stall (which can be recognized by reactivation of the stick shaker or
aerodynamic buffet).
 
31FDR data on control column position indicated that the elevator controls were not jammed during the loss of
control sequence.</div>

2.2.1.3 Accident Scenario Analysis and Discussion 
Although these two scenarios were the most likely explanations for the initiating flight 
control event, neither scenario was completely consistent with the investigative evidence. Therefore, the NTSB concludes that the accident sequence initiated as a result of a control 
problem that was related to either an inadvertent autopilot activation or a pitch trim anomaly, the 
effects of which were compounded by aileron and/or rudder trim inputs; however, it was not 
possible to determine the exact nature of the initiating event. Regardless of what the initiating event was, evidence from Cessna flight test records, 
postaccident simulator tests, and the NTSB’s postaccident performance study indicated that the 
result would have been controllable if the captain had not allowed the airspeed and resulting 
control forces to increase while he tried to troubleshoot the problem. Evidence showed that, 
despite the abnormal control situation, the captain was able to maintain control of the airplane 
without much exertion when the airplane was operating at a relatively slow airspeed shortly after 
takeoff, but he increasingly struggled as the airplane accelerated and the control forces increased. By allowing the airplane’s airspeed to increase while engaging in haphazard and poorly 
coordinated troubleshooting efforts, the pilots allowed an abnormal situation to escalate to an 
emergency. Therefore, the NTSB concludes that, regardless of the initiating event, if the pilots 
had simply maintained a reduced airspeed while they responded to the situation, the aerodynamic 
forces on the airplane would not have increased significantly; at reduced airspeeds, the pilots 
should have been able to maintain control of the airplane long enough to either successfully 
troubleshoot and resolve the problem or return safely to the airport. If the accident pilots had sought guidance for either of the potential scenarios in the 
airplane’s checklists or manuals, they would not have found it, because no such guidance existed. However, AFM guidance for a different control anomaly (a jammed elevator trim) suggests that, 
in the face of an unexpected and unidentified control problem, a pilot should maintain a 
configuration and airspeed already proven to be controllable.83 
In partial response to an NTSB safety recommendation issued after a series of 
upset-related air carrier accidents (A-96-120), an industry team developed an airplane upset 
recovery training aid designed to “increase the ability of pilots to recognize and avoid situations 
that can lead to airplane upsets and to improve their ability to recover control of an airplane….” 
The FAA has issued an NPRM, which,84 if adopted as a rule, would require minimum standards 
for 14 CFR Part 121 flight crewmember upset and loss of control training that references the 
airplane upset recovery training aid.</div>

the accident sequence was confused. According to the NTSB’s performance study, the lateral and 
directional handling problems that would result from inadvertent autopilot activation and mistrim 
under these circumstances would result in control forces that were light at first and larger as the 
airplane accelerated and turned further from the runway extended centerline heading. The effects 
 
75 The Citation 550 pilots involved with the simulator testing during the investigation stated that each, at one 
time in their careers, had inadvertently pushed the autopilot instead of the yaw damper buttons. 
76 About 35 seconds after takeoff, after the captain made his third mention of an unspecified control problem, 
the first officer stated, “how’s your trim set? Is that the way you want it?” About 12 seconds later, after the captain 
stated that the airplane wanted to “turn hard left,” the first officer asked, “how’s your trim down here?” Finally, 
about 1 ½ minutes after takeoff, the first officer asked, “how’s that, any better?”

of the autopilot turning the airplane toward the runway’s magnetic heading and the forces 
resulting from the mistrimmed condition ultimately would have demanded strenuous inputs from 
both pilots to maintain control. The performance study results were consistent with many aspects of this interpretation of 
the accident sequence. For example, the captain first complained of a control problem just 
moments after the airplane would have begun to turn from the initial autopilot engagement 
heading in accordance with the departure clearance, when an inadvertently activated autopilot 
would have been trying to return the airplane to the initial autopilot engagement heading. About 
1 1/2 minutes later, after the control problem had escalated (likely as a result of the first officer’s 
trim inputs and the captain allowing the airplane to accelerate while he dealt with the 
unidentified control problem), the captain decided to declare an emergency and return to MKE. The final loss of control began about 1 minute later, just after the captain transferred the controls 
to the first officer to look for the autopilot circuit breaker. The performance study showed that 
the transfer of control occurred when the airplane was heading back towards MKE and passed 
through and moved away from the autopilot engagement heading, which, according to this 
scenario, would have resulted in dynamically changing forces on the control wheel as the 
autopilot reversed the direction of its input in an attempt to return to the runway heading. Other evidence was inconsistent with this scenario, however. For example, examination 
of the recovered autopilot servomotor clutches and the unstretched filaments in the cockpit 
autopilot-engaged light bulb (which was not illuminated at impact) suggested that, although the 
autopilot did have power at impact, it was likely not engaged at impact.77 Some stretching was 
observed in the yaw-damper-engaged bulb filaments.</div>

3. Conclusions 3.1 Findings 
1. The captain and first officer were properly certificated and qualified under federal 
regulations to act in their respective roles during the accident flight. There was no evidence 
of any medical conditions that might have adversely affected the pilots’ performance during 
the accident flight. 
2. Although the captain’s pilot certificates had previously been revoked because of a felony 
conviction involving the illegal transport of drugs into the United States, the Federal 
Aviation Administration had reissued his pilot certificates, and they were valid at the time of 
the accident. 
3. The accident airplane was properly certificated, was equipped and maintained in accordance 
with industry practices (except for the wiring installed in the pilots’ control yokes), and was 
within weight and center of gravity limits. 
4. If the accident airplane had been equipped with a recorder system that captured cockpit 
images and parametric data, investigators would have been better able to determine the 
circumstances that led to this accident. 
5. The accident sequence initiated as a result of a control problem that was related to either an 
inadvertent autopilot activation or a pitch trim anomaly, the effects of which were 
compounded by aileron and/or rudder trim inputs; however, it was not possible to determine 
the exact nature of the initiating event. 
6. Regardless of the initiating event, if the pilots had simply maintained a reduced airspeed 
while they responded to the situation, the aerodynamic forces on the airplane would not have 
increased significantly; at reduced airspeeds, the pilots should have been able to maintain 
control of the airplane long enough to either successfully troubleshoot and resolve the 
problem or return safely to the airport. 
7. Pilots would benefit from training and readily accessible guidance indicating that, when 
confronted with abnormal flight control forces, they should prioritize airplane control 
(airspeed, attitude, and configuration) before attempting to identify and eliminate the cause 
of the flight control problem. 
8. The design and location of the yaw damper and autopilot switches on Cessna Citation series 
airplanes do not adequately protect against inadvertent activation of a system, which could 
have disastrous consequences.

9. A rounded type of sheathed wire bundle would fit better and be better protected within the 
control column shaft than the currently installed flat ribbon cable; replacement of the flat 
ribbon cable with a rounded type of sheathed wire bundle could result in fewer short circuits 
and other electrical events. 
10. The incorporation of an aural pitch trim-in-motion warning and contrasting color bands on 
the pitch trim wheel in all Cessna Citation series airplanes would help pilots of those 
airplanes to more promptly recognize and correct runaway pitch trim situations before 
control forces become unmanageable.

the PMS and lowering the airplane&#x27;s nose by rotating the pitch control wheel on the

exaggerated during the transfer from system monitor mode to system controller because
time is needed to ascertain the status of the airplane and assess the situation before the
pilut can reenter the control loop and take corrective action. When the autopilot was
disengaged, the airplane&#x27;s excursion fror the stabilized condition was well advaneed and
at the point where immediate and proper corrective action was required if the situation
was to be remedied safely. The captain was not only unable to assess the situation
properly, he was confused by it; therefore, he was unable to take the necessary action to
correct the situation. The DFUR data indicated that his actions most probably
aggravated the situation. The Safety Board concludes that the captain became spatially
disoriented at the onset of the upset and was unable to reorient himself until the airplane
bagan to emerge from the clouds. ‘The fact that the first officer was unable to help the
captain reorient himself during the descent showed that he also became disoriented during
the upset and descent. The Safety Board further notes that the captain did not, as was recommended
during his training and in his training manual, disengage the autopilot when the No. 4
engine initially “hung.” Thereafter, he reiied on the autopilot to maintain the alrplane in
straight and level flight during the deceleration, and he did not apply left rudder trim to
level the control wheel before disengaging the autopilot. Sinee the decreasing airspeed
was Initially and readily apparent and would, if allowed to continue unchecked at FL 410,
seriously menace the safety of his alrplane, the captain&#x27;s continuing preoccupation with
airspeed control was understandable. However, the captain was an experienced
multiengine and Boeing 747 pilot and he also should have known how the loss of thrust

_ from an outboard engine would affect an alrplane&#x27;s controllability, especially when it is

coupled with decreasing airspeed. Given his Boeing 747 experience, the captain should
have also known that the autopilot&#x27;s lateral control authority did not include the rudder
aiid that the effects of the thrust loss covid only be counteracted by introducing a leftwing-down roll, an aotion which would also introduce a side slip, increase droy, and
aggravate the airspeed decrease. Given these circumstances, the Safety Board explored
the reasons why the captain was not alert te this condition and why he was not monitoring
his attitude direction Indicator more closely during this phase of the operation.</div>

airplane malfunction effected the performance of the airplane; the loss

‘he lateral control deflectinns required to maintain level flight under
conditions of thrust asymmetry and decreasing alrspeed exceeded the
limits of the autopilot&#x27;s lateral control autnority, causing the airplane to
roll and yew to the right. The captain lost control of the airplane when,
after disengaging the autopilot, Ke failed to make the proper flight
control corrections to recover the airplane. The damage to the airplane was @ result of the acceleration forces and
high airspeeds that occurred during the upset and recovery Inaneuvers. 3.2 Probable Cause

he National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause
of this accident was the captain&#x27;s preoccupation with an inflight malfunction and his
failure to monitor properly the airplane&#x27;s flight instruments which resulted in his losing

control of the airplane. Contributing to the accident was the captain&#x27;s over-reliance on the autopilot
after the loss of thrust on the No. 4 engine. 4. RECOMMENDATIONS

INVESTIGATION AND HEARING 1. Investigation

The National Transportation Safety Board was notified of the accident about
1800 eastern standard time on February 19, 1985, and immediately dispatched an
investigator from its Los Angeles Field Office to San Francisco. At 0806 eastern standard
time, February 20, 1985, an investigative team from Washington, D.C. was dispatched to
San Francisco. Investigative groups were established for operat&#x27;ons, air traffic control,
meteorology, survival factors, airplane structures, airplane syster 3, powerplants, cockpit
voice recorder, digital flight data recorder, human performance, and airplane
performance. Parties to the investigation were the Federal Aviation Adrainistration, the
Boeing Commercial Airplane Company, and the Pratt and Whitney Division of the United
Technologies Corporation. The Chinese Civil Aeronautics Administration appointed an
accredited representative to assist the Safety Board during the investigation.</div>

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] The Safety Board concludes that one of the causal factors of *he accident was
the captain&#x27;s reliance on the autopilot while the airplane was decelerating. During this
3 minute 40 second period, the captain allowed himself to remain removed from the
&quot;control loop&quot; by leaving the autopilot engaged. As a result, he was net aware of the
increasing control inputs required to maintain level flight. Had the captain placed himself
in a &quot;hands on&quot; relationship with the airplane by disconnecting the autopilot at .1e onset
of the engine problem, he probably would ive been more alert to the increasing
asymmetrical forces being exerted on the airplane since he would have been required to
make the necessary control inputs to maintain level flight. Since he had no physical
relationship with the airplane flight controls, the only cues available to him to monitor
the airplane&#x27;s attitude and performance were the visual cues available from either the
airplane instruments or the outside horizon since the airplane was flying above the clouds. However, even under conditions of visual flight, the flight instruments remain the primary
tools at high altitudes for maintaining level, stabilized flight in large airplanes. The
captain&#x27;s statement corroborated the fact that he was relying on these instruments for
that purpose. Under these conditions, therefore, the primary instrument for attitude
control was the attitude director indicator, which may not have concerned the captain
initially since it depleted either a wings-level attitude or a very slight left-wing-down
bank. With regard to heading, over the period between 1011:09 to about 1014:00, the
heading increased about 4°, a change so slight as to be almost imperceptible. Thus, except
for airspeed, which concerned the captain greatly, the only thing in the cockpit that would
have depicted the worsening control situation was the control wheel&#x27;s increasing leftwing-down deflection. However, this was an area which was not included in the captain&#x27;s
regular instrument scan pattern, and since he was rot &quot;hands on,&quot; he was not aware of the

deflection. .

During the latter part of this perioa, the captain&#x27;s statement indicated that his
attention seemed to be directed almost solely to the airspeed indicator as he tried to
arrest the airspeed decrease. Thus, whe he failed to arrest the decrease by disengaging
the PMS and lowering the airplane&#x27;s nose by rotating the pitch control wheel on the
autopilot manual control module, he disconnected the autopilot.</div>

Safety Board believes that the captain’s action was not only contrary to company
procedures, but contrary to the principles of basic airmanship. Of equal concern
is the inaction of the first officer to question the captain or monitor the autoflight
system selection. The Safety Board concludes that the captain’s inappropriate selection of the
&quot;pitch hold&quot; mode combined with the flightcrew’s subsequent failure to maintain
a safe airspeed was the primary cause of this accident. Flightcrew Inattentiveness

The recorded cockpit conversation between the captain, first officer, and
flight attendant was consistent with a complacent and lax atmosphere throughout
the flight. Having selected the &quot;pitch hold&quot; mode for the climb, it was particularly
important that the flightcrew monitor the essential flight instruments continually
to maintain a safe airspeed and positive rate of climb. Instead, the captain
permitted the flight attendant to enter the cockpit and then engaged in casual

25

conversation for over 4 minutes before the loss of control occurred. Meanwhile,
the first officer was making entries into the airplane’s log book, which diverted his
attention from the flight instruments. It was in response to the flight attendant’s request that the captain selected
an increased pitch attitude. Subsequently, he continued to talk to the flight
attendant and was not attentive to his flight instruments. The Safety Board
believes it likely that the captain began to dial in nose-right rudder trim as a
normal action during climb and, without observing the turn-and-slip indicator,
continued to do so until full trim was reached. A passenger observed the captain
&quot;turning a knob&quot; that was located in the approximate position of the rudder trim
knob. The investigation determined that there were no autoflight or trim system
malfunctions that could have resulted in full nose-right rudder trim. Further, neither of the flightcrew remembered observing the wing leading
edges or propeller spinners to check for ice accretion even though they were flying
through visible moisture and freezing temperatures. The Safety Board believes
that the flightcrew’s inattention to the flight led directly to their failure to maintain
a safe airspeed. ‘

It is probable that, during their last sequence of flights together, all three
crewmembers became too relaxed with each other and, consequently, less
professional in their relationship during flight. For instance, the open cockpit door
and the non-use of headsets by the flightcrew encouraged and certainly allowed the
flight attendant to distract the pilots for several minutes while a critical, unsafe
flight situation developed. The crewmembers were apparently comfortable enough
together to allow themselves to become extremely complacent, and the lax cockpit
atmosphere set by the captain was accepted by the other crewmembers. All three
individuals should have done more to prevent the accident situation from
developing, and good crew coordination and resource management principles
certainly would have assisted them. Stall Recovery

The procedures for stall recovery are delineated in the Continental Express
Operations Manual, and pilots are required to demonstrate their knowledge of
these procedures repeatedly during training. However, the Safety Board believes
that the pilot training for stall recovery is directed toward low altitude encounters

26

where minimum altitude loss is critical.</div>

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] The Safety Board considered and could not conclusively discard the
possibility that the nacelle damage was caused by the maneuvering and air loads
imposed on the structure during the out-of-control descent. If this were the case,
the distortion of the nacelle and engine mounts could have moved the propeller
control linkage to feather, which in turn would have resulted in a less of blade
centrifugal loads, which permitted the blades to separate. The Safety Board
believes that it is more probable that the loss of the propeller blades was initiated
when the crew attempted to feather the left engine in the belief that an engine
overspeed had occurred. The loss of centrifugal loads on the blades as the
propeller rotational speed slowed, combined with the severe cyclic loads imposed
on the blades-during the departure from stabilized flight, would have allowed the
blades to rock in the hub with consequent failure of the blade retaining rings,
release of the bearings, and blade separation. The Safety Board believes that the
imbalance of the propeller assembly as the blades separated imposed the high
vibratory loads to the engine shaft, which produced the nacelle damage. Thus, the Safety Board believes that while the propeller blade separation was
a result of the loss of control, it contributed to the severity of the accident, in that
the effective loss of one engine and the nacelle damage resulted in a performance
degradation that limited the captain’s ability to control the airplane and maintain
altitude. The limited control led to a long landing touchdown and subsequent
overrun. Flightcrew Performance
Selection of Improper Autoflight Mode

The Safety Board believes that the guidance provided in Continental
Express’ manuals and training programs is clear in the description of the autoflight
system operating modes. These materials specifically state that climbs should be
conducted in either the &quot;climb&quot; or &quot;airspeed&quot; modes to ensure that an adequate
airspeed margin above stall is maintained. Contrary to that guidance, the captain
chose to use the “pitch hold&quot; mode. Moreover, the captain increased the pitch
attitude to increase the rate of climb apparently without reference or concern about
the performance capability of the airplane to maintain a safe airspeed. Consequently, the airspeed decreased, and as a result of increased drag, the rate
of climb decreased. That the captain’s action to select the “pitch hold&quot; mode was
intentional is evident from his postaccident statements and his attempt to increase
the pitch attitude in response to the flight attendant’s request to enhance the rate
of climb. The Safety Board is particularly concerned that an experienced pilot with
over 2,500 hours in the airplane type would fail to recognize the loss of efficiency
as well as the potential danger in selecting a constant pitch attitude climb. The
Safety Board believes that the captain’s action was not only contrary to company
procedures, but contrary to the principles of basic airmanship. Of equal concern
is the inaction of the first officer to question the captain or monitor the autoflight
system selection. The Safety Board concludes that the captain’s inappropriate selection of the
&quot;pitch hold&quot; mode combined with the flightcrew’s subsequent failure to maintain
a safe airspeed was the primary cause of this accident.</div>

to pass on information about the ILS outage and about men and equipment on the
runway did not contribute to the accident sequence of events. The weather in the
Pine Bluff local area was VFR, and by the time that the aircraft had landed, the
full length of the runway was available. 11. CONCLUSIONS

1. The airplane was properly certificated, equipped, and maintained in
accordance with FAA regulations and approved Continental Express
procedures,

2. The airplane was dispatched in accordance with FAA regulations and
operator procedures and was within the prescribed limits for weight
and center of gravity.

3. The Continental Express operations and maintenance procedures
pertinent to the conduct of the accident flight were found to be
logical, clearly presented, and in accordance with the FARs. In many
instances, the operator’s procedures and requirements exceeded the
minimum standards set by the FAA.

4. Both crewmembers were properly certificated, qualified, and current
for the operation being conducted.

5. All of the flight control, autoflight, stall warning, and flight
instrument systems were operating normally up to the time of the loss
of control. No evidence of primary or trim flight control system
malfunction was found.

6. The freezing level was near 11,500 feet and the potential for icing
existed up through 19,000 feet. The airplane was in clouds with zero
visibility, and the tops of the clouds extended above 21,000 feet.

The entire crew violated the sterile cockpit rule as the airplane was
passing through 8,000 feet. In addition, the flight attendant was
present in the cockpit as the airplane climbed above 10,000 feet,
engaging in nonpertinent conversation with the captain, for 4 minutes
and 27 seconds up to and during the loss of the control. The captain and the first officer failed to adequately monitor the
progress of the flight during the climb, and the first officer failed to
adequately monitor the captain’s actions. The captain engaged the autoflight system in the &quot;heading&quot; and &quot;pitch
hold&quot; modes during the climb, obviating the stall and speed protection
afforded by the other vertical modes. This autoflight system
configuration was contrary to the company’s training and procedures. During the climb, the pitch was increased by the captain, using the
autoflight “pitch hold&quot; mode, in the minutes before the loss of
control. LS

The increase in pitch, and subsequent loss of airspeed, resulted in an
aerodynamic stall. The stall and loss of contro! at a higher-thanexpected airspeed was caused by aerodynamic performance
degradation due to wing ice contamination. The captain did not respond immediately to the stick shaker warning,
which was followed within 2 seconds by a loss of Jateral control. Thereafter, the continued exertion of back force on the control column
was inappropriate. The airplane recovered from the out-of-control descent when control
forces were relaxed and the landing gear was lowered. The operation of the engines and propellers was normal until after the
loss of control.</div>

system was iudicated to the flightcrew, or the manner in which the
thrust reduction occurred, the flight instrumonts (altimeters,
vertical speed indicators, airspeed indicators, pitch attitude indicators, and the autopilot vertical speed selector) would have indicated abnormally for a level-flight condition. Together with the
altitude-alerting, 1/2-second, C-chord siznal, the flight instrument
indications should have alerted the crew to ths undesired descent. The throttle reductions and contro! column force inputs which
were made by the crew, and which caused the aircraft to descend,
suggest that crewmembers were not aware of the low force gradient
input required to effect a change in aircraft attitude while in CWS. The Board learned that this lack of knowledge about the capabilities
of the new autopilot was not limited to the flightcrew of Flight 401,
Pilot training and autopilot operational policies wera studied extensively during the field phase of the investigation, and were discussed,
at great length, in the public hearing connected with this accident. Although formal training provided adequate opportunity to become
familiar with this new concept of aircraft control, operational
experience with the autopilot was limited by company policy. Company Operational procedures did not permit operation of the aircraft
in CWS; they required all operations to be conducted in the command
modes. This restriction might have compromised the ability of

pilots to use and understand the unique CWS feature of the new
autopilot. However, the Board believes that the present Eastern Air
Lines training program is adequate but is in need of more frequent
quality control progress checks of the student during the ground
school phase of the training and an early operational proficiency
followup check in the flight simulator after the pilot has flown the
L-1011 in scheduled passenger cervice. Another problem concerns the new automatic systems which
are coming into service with newer aircraft and being added to
older aircraft. Flightcrews become more reliant upon the functioning of sophisticated avionics systems, and their associated automation,
to fly the airplane. This is increasingly so aa the reliability of such
equipment improves. Basic control of the aircraft and supervision
of the flight&#x27;s progress by instrument indications diminish as other
more pressing tasks in the cockpit altract attention because of the
overreliance on such automatic cquipment. Pilots&#x27; testimony indicated that dependence on the reliability
and capability of the autopilot is actually greater than anticipated in
its early design and it. certification. This is particularly true in
the cruise phase of flight. However, in this phase of flight, the
autopilot is not designed to remain correctly and safely operational,
without performance degradation, after a significant failure occurs. In any event, good pilot practices and company training dictate
that one pilot will monitor the progress of the aircraft at all times
and under ali circumstances. The Beard is aware of the distractions that can interrupt the
routine of flight. Such distractions usually do not affect other flight
requirements because of their short duration or their routine
integration into the flying task. However, the following took place
in this accident:

impact is contained in Appendix G. In attempts to distinguish between
autopilot &quot;ON&quot; and &quot;OFF,&quot; considerable reliance was placed on DFDR
data which showed the ratio between pilot and copilot contro! cable system
input motion inthe roll axis, since the rati&gt; varies between manual
and autopilot operation. This characteristic of the L-1011 lateral
control system, verified by ground and flight tests, was used to distinguish between autopilot &quot;ON&quot; and &quot;OFF&quot; whenever there was
appreciable roll activity. During lateial maneuvering with CWS,
this ratio becomas less definitive, and, although autopilot &quot;ON&quot; and
&quot;OFF&quot; status can be determined, positive identification of the selected
mode becomes morxe difficult,

the mismatch between computers &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; would become a
significant factor in thie analysis. Because of this mismatch and

the system design, a force exerted on the captain&#x27;s centrol wheel

in excess of 15 pounds, but fess than 20 pounds, could result tn disengagem::nt of the altitude hold function without the occurrence of a
corresponding indication of the first officer&#x27;s annunciator panel. This would lead to a situation in which tha first officer, unaware

that altitude hold had been disengaged, would not be alerted tc the
aircraft altitude deviation. If the autopilot system &#x27;B&quot; was engaged,
as is believed to have happened, such a situation could not have
occurred since a force in excess of 20 pounds would have been required
to disengage the altitude hold function and both annunciator panels
would have indicated correctly. Therefore, the Board concludes that
the mismatched pitch computers in the autoflight system were not a
critical factor in this accident. However, it is significant that recognition of the aforementioned

control system motions that the heading select mode was used for the
last 255 seconds of flight to control the aircraft to a heading of 270°.
Since selection of the new heading would have required action by the
first officer, which included attention to the autopilot control panel,
it is reasonable to assume that he should have been aware of the
selected heading select functions at this time. It is also reasonable
to assume that the autopilot was set up to provide pitch attitude stabilization sensitive to contro! wheel inputs and heading select, wherein
lateral guidance signals were provided to achieve and maintain the
270° heading. In the pitch attitude stabilization mode, the aircraft will respond
to intentional or unintentional movements of the control wheel. Furthermore, while the aircraft is operating in this mode, the effect of aircraft
thrust changes, without compensating pitch attitude contro! inputs, will
he directly related to changes in vertical speed.

A series of reductions in power began 160 seconds before impact. The power reductions and slight nosedown pitch’ cohtrol movements together were reaponsible for the unrecognized dasvent’ which followed. Extensive flight testing and simulation studigsof N310EA&#x27;s entire I
Speed Control System (SCS) (autothrottle) were conducted to identify the

reason for the series of reductions in thrust during the last few
minutes of the flight. Thrust reductions generated by the N310EA
autothrottle components installed in the test aircraft were dissimilar
to those reductions recorded on the DFDR from the accident aircraft. In one series of flight tests, the autothrottle speed reference was

set to 175 nots indiceted airspeed (IAS) and a descent rate of 200
feet per minute was established. The airspeed was maintained to
within + 3 knots of the reference speed by the SCS, until the autathrottle authority limits were reached (flight idle thrust). Such
control during the flight of N301EA was not evident; a 15-knot increase
in airspeed did occur, with throttle authority still available. Comparison of the autothrottle system simulation data with Flight 401&#x27;s
air3sneed and acceleration data confirmed that the throttles would
have been retarded to the flight idle position relatively quickly. Reference to the DF DR shows that pewer onthe No. 3 engine
was increased slightly, 1 minute before reduction of power on the
Nos. 2 and 3 engines (the initiation of the descent profile}}. This is
a normal manual adjustment typically made by a pilot, and cannot
be accomplished by the autothrottle system. Additionally, the speed
found set on the autothrottle selectur dial was 160 knots, a speed
well below that attained or maintained during the last 4 minutes of
flight.</div>

10. As a result of complexities in the 777 automatic flight control system and inadequacies in 
related training and documentation, the pilot flying had an inaccurate understanding of 
how the autopilot flight director system and autothrottle interacted to control airspeed, 
which led to his inadvertent deactivation of automatic airspeed control. 
 
11. If the autothrottle automatic engagement function (“wakeup”), or a system with similar 
functionality, had been available during the final approach, it would likely have activated 
and increased power about 20 seconds before impact, which may have prevented the 
accident. 
 
12. A review of the design of the 777 automatic flight control system, with special attention 
given to the issues identified in this accident investigation and the issues identified by the 
Federal Aviation Administration and European Aviation Safety Agency during the 
787 certification program, could yield insights about how to improve the intuitiveness of 
the 777 and 787 flight crew interfaces as well as those incorporated into future designs. 
 
13. If the pilot monitoring had supervised a trainee pilot in operational service during his 
instructor training, he would likely have been better prepared to promptly intervene when 
needed to ensure effective management of the airplane’s flightpath. 
 
14. If Asiana Airlines had not allowed an informal practice of keeping the pilot monitoring’s 
(PM) flight director (F/D) on during a visual approach, the PM would likely have 
switched off both F/Ds, which would have corrected the unintended deactivation of 
automatic airspeed control. 
 
15. By encouraging flight crews to manually fly the airplane before the last 1,000 ft of the 
approach, Asiana Airlines would improve its pilots’ abilities to cope with maneuvering 
changes commonly experienced at major airports and would allow them to be more 
proficient in establishing stabilized approaches under demanding conditions; in this 
accident, the pilot flying may have better used pitch trim, recognized that the airspeed 
was decaying, and taken the appropriate corrective action of adding power. 
 
16. A context-dependent low energy alert would help pilots successfully recover from 
unexpected low energy situations like the situation encountered by the accident pilots. 
 
17. The flight attendants acted appropriately when they initiated an emergency evacuation 
upon determining there was a fire outside door 2R. Further, the delay of about 90 seconds 
in initiating an evacuation was likely due partly to the pilot monitoring’s command not to 
begin an immediate evacuation, as well as disorientation and confusion. 
 
18. Passengers 41B and 41E were unrestrained for landing and ejected through the ruptured 
tail of the airplane at different times during the impact sequence. It is likely that these 
passengers would have remained in the cabin and survived if they had been wearing their 
seatbelts.</div>

29. Although some of the communications difficulties encountered during the emergency 
response, including the lack of radio interoperability, have been remedied, others, such as 
the breakdown in communications between the airport and city dispatch centers, should 
be addressed. 
 
30. The Alert 3 sections of San Francisco International Airport’s 2008 and 2012 emergency 
procedures manuals were not sufficiently robust to anticipate and prevent the problems 
that occurred in the accident response. 3.2 Probable Cause 
The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of this 
accident was the flight crew’s mismanagement of the airplane’s descent during the visual 
approach, the pilot flying’s unintended deactivation of automatic airspeed control, the flight 
crew’s inadequate monitoring of airspeed, and the flight crew’s delayed execution of a go-around 
after they became aware that the airplane was below acceptable glidepath and airspeed 
tolerances. Contributing to the accident were (1) the complexities of the autothrottle and 
autopilot flight director systems that were inadequately described in Boeing’s documentation and 
Asiana’s pilot training, which increased the likelihood of mode error; (2) the flight crew’s 
nonstandard communication and coordination regarding the use of the autothrottle and autopilot 
flight director systems; (3) the pilot flying’s inadequate training on the planning and executing of 
visual approaches; (4) the pilot monitoring/instructor pilot’s inadequate supervision of the pilot 
flying; and (5) flight crew fatigue, which likely degraded their performance. NTSB

manual pilot override in FLCH SPD mode, he said the A/T would resume controlling speed. He 
said that if the 777 A/T system was turned off and airspeed became very low, the A/T would 
transition to TO/GA mode, and he believed that the airplane’s functionality in this respect was 
similar to that of the Airbus A320. These statements indicate that the PF had an inaccurate 
understanding of how the AFDS and A/T interact to control speed in FLCH SPD mode, what 
happens when the A/T is overridden and the throttles transition to HOLD in a FLCH SPD 
descent, and how the A/T automatic engagement feature operates. The complexity of autoflight systems can contribute to faulty mental models of 
automation logic. The systems installed on airplanes like the 777, for example, contain multiple 
subsystems. Each of these subsystems has various modes of operation, and these subsystems are 
intercoupled in various ways. Human factors research involving pilots suggests that they have 
difficulty comprehending the subtleties of the interconnections between various autoflight 
subsystems (Billings 1999). These difficulties lead to gaps in pilots’ mental models that can be 
particularly problematic in highly dynamic and/or nonroutine situations (Sarter and Woods 1997, 
553-569). The problem of faulty pilot mental models of complex autoflight systems can be 
alleviated by improving systems training and reducing design complexity. 
2.4.1 Autoflight System Training 
The PF’s Asiana 777 transition training included two instructor-led ground school lessons 
totaling 6 hours that addressed the 777 autoflight system. The presentations given in these 
lessons used slides based on screen captures of computer-based training lessons purchased from 
Boeing. Use of the AFDS and A/T systems was also covered in other ground and simulator 
lessons. Despite having completed all classroom and simulator training, the PF said he was not 
confident in his understanding of the system. Other Asiana pilots and instructors who were interviewed by investigators after the 
accident also appeared to have inaccurate mental models of AFDS and A/T system functionality 
in some of the same areas as the PF. A review of the Asiana 777 transition training slides 
revealed that they did not provide a complete picture of AFDS and A/T system design logic 
involving the functioning of the A/T in HOLD mode or the availability of minimum speed 
protection when the A/T was in HOLD mode. For example, a training slide labeled “stall

protection features” made the unqualified statement that “autothrottles engage automatically (if 
armed).” No description was provided of the circumstances when the A/T will not automatically 
engage. These circumstances, which were listed in the 777 FCOM, include when the AFDS pitch 
mode is FLCH SPD (as it was during the accident flight) or TO/GA, or the airplane is below 
400 ft above the airport on takeoff or below 100 ft RA on approach.</div>

warrant their deviation from company standard procedures, it nevertheless could have
contributed to it, and provides a plausible explanation for some of the deviations. In summary, the Safety Board acknowledges that conditions were
conducive to producing fatigue in the pilots and increasing susceptibility to
disorientation. The accident circumstances certainly reflect substandard human
performance; however, the available evidence is not sufficient to warrant a
conclusion that crew fatigue adversely affected pilot performance in this accident,
although the Safety Board cannot rule out that possibility. Additionally, there are
other factors that could have contributed to the loss of control that either outweigh or
complement fatigue as a factor in the accident.

2.9 Loss of Control

According to the FDR, the captain began a slow, sustained left tum
(about 0.6 degrees of heading per second and about 5 degrees of bank) about
0324:50. This action was contrary to the published missed approach instructions but
possibly in anticipation of a downwind turn instruction identical to the one given by
the controller on the previous missed approach. Beginning about 0325:00, the sound
of a power reduction is ford on the CVR, and the airplane was approaching its

52

assigned altitude. However, at 0325:10, the FDR still showed the airplane ascending
through 2,800 feet at a rate of about 2,400 feet per minute. At 0325:31, the FDR
showed that the airplane&#x27;s altitude peaked out at 211 feet above the assigned altitude
of 3,000 feet. It is probable that the captain then realized he had overshot his
assigned altitude and proceeded to push the nose over during the decelerating tum to
regain 3,000 feet. About 5 seconds later, shortly after the first officer acknowledged the
tum to 300 degrees, the FDR shows that the tum rate increased dramatically. Simulations show that the bank angle then steepened to about 25 degrees when the
captain uttered the “What&#x27;s the matter&quot; comments. The flightpath study indicates that
8 seconds after exceeding 30 degrees bank angle, the airplane was passing through
about 60 degrees left bank at a 14 degree descent angle. This obvious loss of control, in context with the CVR comments,
prompted the Safety Board to examine the role played in the loss of control by: 1)
transfer of control; 2) spatial disorientation; and 3) the attitude references.

2.9.1 Transfer of Control

There was a positive transfer of control as the second ILS approach was
aborted, when the captain stated, &quot;Oh # I got it.&quot; While the first officer never
acknowledged the release verbally, there were positive affirmations in his response to
the captain&#x27;s commands for flaps and gear. The first officer also began all radio calls
as the nonflying pilot. However, there was no subsequent positive verbal transfer of
control to the first officer prior to the loss of contro) during the second go-around.</div>

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] There was no indication recorded on the CVR that the captain was
physically involved in the recovery maneuver at all. Once he relinquished control, he
did not even &quot;coach&quot; anymore, until 2 seconds before impact when he joined the
flight engineer in saying, “Up, up....&quot;

The first officer took control of the airplane at approximately 0325:50. However, the captain&#x27;s difficulties were signaled about 10 seconds before he asked
“You got it?&quot; The Safety Board believes that the captain verbalized his confusion at
0325:39 with his &quot;What&#x27;s the matter?” query. Also, the airplane exceeded a 30degree bank angle at around 0325:41. Because 30 degrees is the steepest bank angle
used in normal! transport fiying, the captain&#x27;s continued roll into a steeper bank should
have alerted the first officer that he needed to challenge the captain&#x27;s performance. The Safety Board believes that the accident might have been prevented if the first
officer had corrected or challenged the captain&#x27;s overbank in the 10 seconds between
the first signal of trouble and the captain&#x27;s transfer of control statement. The Safety Board was unable to determine the moment when the first
officer detected that the captain was overbanking and unable to control the airplane.

Likewise, the Safety Board was unable to determine whether the first officer&#x27;s poor
performance on the preceding ILS approaches made him hesitant either to speak up
and alert the captain to his deviation from normal flight attitude or to intervene and
correct it. However, the Safety Board believes that this accident highlights the need
for active crew coordination and interaction to avoid having the flying pilot exceed
flight limitations, such as airspeed, pitch, and bank angles. The circumstances further
emphasize the importance of timely action in challenging or correcting fellow
crewmembers. Lastly, the basic control manipulations by the first officer during the
recovery attempt were in general accordance with accepted procedures in that he
attempted to roll the wings level and then began pulling the nose up. If he had been
more aggressive with both sets of controls, he might have succeeded. A larger, more
rapid aileron input would have leveled the wings faster; and a more aggressive
pullout could have been within the operating envelope of the aircraft. Even if he had
exceeded the approved g load for the DC-8, a large safety margin existed to preclude
structural failure in extreme situations. Obviously, this situation called for extremely
quick and aggressive control inputs.

2.11 Cockpit Resource Management on Flight 805

The Safety Board notes that the manner in which the flightcrew
interacted in the latter stages of this flight was not consistent with .idely accepted
CRM principles. Although it was impossible to determine how the pilots related to
each other during their previous flight segments, activities in the cockpit for the last
30 minutes of the flight were more representative of an instructor/student than a
teamwork situation. Cockpit conversation and interaction were one-sided, in that the
captain was dominating the conversation and making all the decisions conceming the
flight until the first officer assumed control of the airplane after the loss of control.</div>

as the nonflying pilot. However, there was no subsequent positive verbal transfer of
control to the first officer prior to the loss of contro) during the second go-around. Even if the captain thought he had relinquished control to the first officer pricr to the
control loss, the first officer demonstrated that he considered himtci: the nonflying
pilot when he acknowledged the assigned vector of 300 degrees at 13°.:36.3. This
transmission was made 2.6 seconds before the captain&#x27;s first question, “What&#x27;s the
matter.&quot; In the subsequent 10 seconds until the captain asked, &quot;You got it?” the
situation deteriorated drastically. Although it is possible that neither pilot was flying
the airplane during this period, given his almost constant prompting on the previous
ILS approaches, it is ir probable that the captain allowed the first officer to fly so
poorly without interjecting some instruction or taking control of the airplane again. Also, the positive initiation of the bank angle was not consistent with uncommanded
airplane motions, which suggests that someone was on the conirols.

2.9.2 Spatial Disorientation

The first officer&#x27;s performance on the second ILS resulted in the captain
taking control probably after not having controlled the airplane since the last landing
in Portland. Orcgon, the previous day. There is no question that the captain became
gravely concemed about something 1 minute and 22 seconds after assuming airplane
control, almost immediately after receiving ATC instructions to tum to a heading of
300 degrees, about 22 seconds prior to impact. He asked, &quot;# # what&#x27;s the matter?”
2.5 seconds after the first officer routinely acknowledged the new heading
assignment. About 4.5 seconds later, the captain became very alarmed and
essentially repeated his initial remark. While both comments are nonspecific, the
Safety Board considered the possibility that they reflected a state of perplexity and
confusion, rather than the captain&#x27;s analysis of a mechanical problem with the
airplane. Although the captain was routinely turning to the assigned heading of
300 degrees when control was lost, he had just transitioned from a climb, reduced
power and was still attempting to level at the assigned altitude of 3,000 feet. This
combination of steady, sustained tuming, acceleration-to-deceleration changeover,
and abrupt ascent to descent transition, at night with no visible horizon or outside
references, is especially conducive to spatial disorientation. Medical experts state that deceleration while tuming can produce the
sensation of tuming in the opposite direction. Had the captain of flight 805
incorrectly believed, at about 0325:36, that he was rolling out of his tum to the left
(the opposite direction), he might have increased the bank angle to the left to
compensate. The fact that the airplane was not simultaneously decelerating, turning,
and descending for a very long time before the problem occurred could lessen the
possibility of this phenomenon.</div>

control system and the ongoing, unresolved deficiencies, the dismissive treatment by the NTSB

27
in the draft report is surprising. This lack of emphasis potentially could be justified if the cause 
of the sheared rivet failures were known and had been thoroughly analyzed. However, without 
knowing the cause of the failures, the NTSB cannot dismiss the issue as unrelated to the 
EgyptAir Flight 990 accident and still expect to maintain high standards of accident investigation 
credibility. 
12. 
(Page 25) This section states that the airplane is controllable with a dual 
bellcrank failure. However, there is no discussion of the increased control forces a pilot would 
experience or the fact that there is no pilot training for this failure. This information is critical to 
a proper analysis of pilot actions. 
13. 
(Page 30) Speech Pattern Information -- This entire section was developed 
without consideration to how a person would react if he were so shocked or ill-prepared by an 
unexpected airplane system failure that he reverted to a state of inaction. This behavior has been 
documented by the NTSB in the past, but is not accounted for here. 
14. 
(Page 32) The purportedly “unintelligible” comment was interpreted by some in 
the CVR group as “control it.” If “control it” was uttered by a crewmember in response to 
observed, unexplained, movement of the control column or the control wheel, it explains both 
the comment and the decision to disconnect the autopilot. Again, this comment is not included 
or discussed in the draft, especially within the context of the statement of the EgyptAir captain 
who observed this activity on the outbound flight. It is puzzling that the NTSB repeatedly describes this phase as “unintelligible” when five 
of the nine CVR Group members were able to understand the words -- with four believing it to 
be “control it” and one thinking it was “hydraulic.” In fact, it was only a minority of the group 
that found the speech “unintelligible.” In light of these facts, it is wrong for the NTSB to label 
the utterance as unintelligible. The comment that these words “might have been an isolated 
declaration” of the RFO is sheer speculation. In fact, given the RFO’s reported lack of comfort 
using English, it is highly unlikely that he was the speaker.

28
15. 
(Page 34) Here, the NTSB describes its review of the transcripts of other 
accidents and states that it “did not observe instances on these CVR recordings in which a pilot 
failed to exhibit surprise, alarm, or increased stress . . . .” The NTSB’s purpose in making this 
comparison with Flight 990 obviously is to suggest that the absence of exclamations from the 
RFO indicates he was in control of the events and, therefore, was not surprised.</div>

airplane is much higher than normal and must be sustained by the crew for longer than normal. Under zero g conditions, it may be difficult, if not impossible, for an unrestrained crewmember 
to exert sufficient force on the controls to affect the same recovery demonstrated in the 
simulator. Consequently, no conclusions as to probable cause should be based on the purported 
recoverability of the airplane. 
5. 
(Page 15, footnote 32) The routing of the cable in Figure 1a appears to be the 
opposite of the routing described in the footnote. 
6. 
(Page 21-22) The NTSB mischaracterizes the report of the EgyptAir Captain on 
the outbound flight to Los Angeles regarding the operation of the autopilot. The important fact 
is not that the autopilot could not be reengaged, but rather why Captain Arram disconnected the 
autopilot in the first place. With respect to that question, Captain Arram reported that he 
observed movement in the control column, as if the autopilot was “hunting.” Because of the 
abnormal movement in the control column, he disengaged the autopilot. It is entirely possible

24
that the RFO also observed unusual movement in the control column and, like Captain Arram 
before him, decided to disconnect the autopilot. 
7. 
(Page 22) The NTSB states that all of the previous elevator movements on 
autopilot disconnect -- which were “primarily in the trailing-edge-down (TED) direction” -- 
were consistent with “normal operation.” The ECAA is not aware of any Boeing supplied data 
that shows a TED movement is expected consistently upon autopilot disconnect and has not been 
shown any data or studies to confirm that movement of .88 degrees or less is “normal.” 
8. 
(Page 23) The discussion of Boeing 767 bellcrank anomalies minimizes the 
critical safety aspects represented by these findings and is presented in such a way as to convince 
the reader that these types of failures never happened on EgyptAir Flight 990. The report does 
not point out that the Egyptian Team was responsible for the identification of the possibility of 
bellcrank assembly failures due to rivet shears and PCA jams. The NTSB Systems investigation 
refused to address these issues or to bring the safety deficiencies to the attention of the FAA. The draft report does not discuss the cumulative findings that were developed which suggest that 
there was a similar bellcrank/PCA failure associated with EgyptAir Flight 990. The facts are that, as a result of the safety issues raised during the EgyptAir Flight 990 
investigation, the FAA issued two Airworthiness Directives concerning the Boeing 767 bellcrank 
assemblies. More than 152 bellcrank assembly rivets were found defective. Of this number, 52 
had to be replaced before the airplanes were allowed to fly again. The FAA determined that the 
approved Boeing inspection procedure for the rivets was inadequate. Boeing is evaluating 
design changes, as the potential terminating action, of the system.</div>

the FDR flight profile towards, or away from, the E Cab simulator profile for a dual actuator 
failure. This aspect of the investigation underscores the manner in which the factual record and 
the subsequent analysis was selectively developed in the draft report. 
27. 
(Page 59) The NTSB’s assertion that there was “no evidence of any ATC 
problems or issues” is incorrect. The ATC transcript included in the docket shows that Flight 
990 was “lost” in the ATC system during the handoff from New York TRACON to New York 
ARTCC. Further, the controller did not attempt to contact Flight 990 until six minutes after the 
accident sequence began and almost four minutes after the airplane crashed into the ocean. It 
appears that the light early morning air traffic may have lulled the controller into a period of

34
inattention. It is neither acceptable nor explainable that an ATC controller does not notice the 
disappearance of an aircraft for more than four minutes after the last possible transponder radar 
return -- particularly when there are only a few airplanes in the air. 
28. 
(Page 60) The analysis does not address in any way the reports of unexplained 
movements of the control column or the control wheel. These events on the outbound flight are 
possibly the reason the RFO disconnected the autopilot on EgyptAir Flight 990. 
29. 
(Page 60) The discrepancy between the left and right elevators as recorded on the 
FDR prior to the event are not cited or analyzed. The position differences are indicative of an 
anomaly in the elevator control system and are critical to the analysis of the PCA jam/failure 
scenario 
30. 
(Page 61) This sweeping generalization does not at all address the likelihood or 
possibility that the right elevator separated from the airplane about 0150:21. EgyptAir 
previously provided the NTSB with detailed calculations regarding the expected roll rate that 
would have occurred if the elevator were attached and in fact split from the left elevator to the 
extent indicated on the FDR. The NTSB must explain why the expected roll did not occur. 
31. 
(Pages 62-63) The discussion of the recovered PCA’s and the bellcrank 
assemblies provides no in-depth analysis or a description of the anomalies that have been 
documented. The Board again fails to note that the one PCA from EgyptAir Flight 990 with a 
sheared rivet, sheared slid pin and an improperly positioned coil spring is the only PCA ever 
examined by the NTSB with any observable anomalies. The NTSB’s analysis does not address 
the shear patterns of the recovered elevator bellcrank assemblies except to attribute them in 
general to “high speed water impact and under water recovery.” There are no facts in the docket 
to support, much less prove, this conclusion. This analysis is inadequate and speculative and, 
more importantly, appears intended solely to support the deliberate act scenario.</div>

The fire damaye found in left wing components submerged in mud and
water indicates that a fire broke out in that area of the wing while the
aircraft was in fiight. Despite extensive efforts with earth-moving
equipnent, enough of the left wing structure could not be recovered from
the main craters to determine the origin and the progress of the in-flight
fire or the extert of resulting structural damage. Thus, the effect of
the wing fire on aircraft controllability could not Le assessed. The crew&#x27;s prececupation with an in-flight fire might have been a
reason for the silence after the radio calls and the departure clearances. The preoccupation with the fire and its effect on airera‘t controllability could have contributed to the loss of control.

(2) Turbulence Upset:

Yu s¢Aition co an in-flight fire, the aircraft might also have been
upset if i+ had encountered thunderstorm turbulence. The aircraft flew
close tc, 1f not actually into, the thunderstorm activity west of the airport. ‘The echo intensity of tre storm, as depicted on the ‘adarscope at
0426, was classified in the radar werther observations as &quot;strong.&quot; The
thunderstorm had the potential of producing severe turbulence and strong
updrafts and downdrafts. If severe turbulence was encountered, the aircraft could have becn upset as the crew was turning it to detour the
storm. The aircraft was probably flying at a relatively low altitude
when it reached the heavy rainfall normally assoctated with downdrafts. To maintain that altitude would have affected airspeed and, thereby, controllability. The Safety Board believes that an encounter with turbulence
could have played a significant part in the loss of control of N2796.

(3) Lightning Strike:

The probability of lightning strikes occurring and momentarily blinding the crew was also considered, However, the setting of the cockpit
lights, which would have been a factor in the effect of a lightning flash
on the crew, could not be determined, A Lightning strike also might have
ignited the in-flight fires; but there {{fs no evidence to support this
theory.

(4) Loss of Instrument Indications:

Finally, loss of instrument indications in flight was considered

radarscope when the aircraft&#x27;s altitude is 500 feet or lower. Since N296 struck the ground on a 39° heading, the steep, left
descending turn from 230° mist have occurred at an extremely high rate,
typical of a spiral-type maneuver. The controller&#x27;s observations suggest
that this spiraling turn had already devaloped when the aircraft&#x27;s radar
return disappeared from the scope. The 90° difference between impact
heading and wreckage ecatter is another indication that the aircraft was
out of control. Therefore, the loss of control of the aircraft was the
final event in a series of events, the sequence of which cannot be determined. Four possible explanations for the loss of aircraft control were
considered: (1) In-flight fire, (2) turbulence upset, (3) lightning
strike, or (4) loss of instrument indications,

(1) In-flight Fire:

Although most of the charring of fuel lines and other components of
the Nos. 2, 3, and 4 engines is attributed to the post-crash fire, the
greater intensity of the fire Jamage in the mud-covered areas of thea No.
1 engine suggests an in-flight fire in that engine. ‘The damaged gasket

runaway trim condition could have gore undetected for a sufficient length of time to
place the airplane in a descending attitude that was not detected by the pilot In time to
overpower the mistrim condition and to effect recovery from the descent. Impact and
fire damage precluded positively eliminating the airplane trim system as a causal facter,
and runaway trim could explain the reason for the accident although there {{s no history of
this problem with PA-31 type airplanes. Autopilot use.--If the pilot was using the autopilot to fly the approach and to
execute the missed approach, a malfanction or improper action by the pilot also could
have initiated the descent and gone undetected for a short time. Although the compeny
unwritten procedures and guidance specify that a pilot not use the autopilot for
instrument approaches, the possibility exists that the pilot of N41070 did. The capab&#x27;&#x27; ;
of the Century 41 autopilot to track the inbound course and to hold a desired alti
during the approach would have reduced pilot workload. Similarly, the pilot could have
readily executed the missed approach by means of inputs to the autopilot. Therefore, the
Safety Board could not rule out the possibility that the pilot used the autopilot during the
approach to reduce workload, or merely to see how well it performed. Moreover, the
audio warning described ty the survivor could have been the autopilot disconnect alert. Although the survivor recalled hearing a &quot;bell,&quot; there were no bell-type aural warnings
installed in N41070. The sound of the autopilot disconnect aural warning is a bong-type
sound which might have been the sound the survivor recalled hearing. If it was, it could
mean that the pilot was using the autopilot during the approach and it was disconnected
during the missed approach. The attopllot could have been disconnected when the pilot
pushed the disconnect button, or when he overrode it by pulling back on the control yoke.
{{ the autopilot malfunctioned and initlated the descent, or the pilot made an improper
input once he recognized the deviation, he would have disconnected the autopilot eitiner
by overciding it or pushing the disconnect.</div>

2.2 Possible Reasons for tire Descent

The Safety Board was not able to Jetermine why the airplane lost altitude and
crashed during the missed approach attempt. Several of the more likely possibilities were
considerad, but none of tham could be confirmed based on the available evidence. Mechanica) failure.--Flight control or trim malfunctions or flight insteumeut
failures could account for the unwanted descent; however, the damage to and destruction
of the flivht control components and flight instruments precluded a positive conelusicn
that they were functioning properly. However, the Safety Board believes that such
system malfunctions are improbable becuse the airplane was controllable until a few
seconds before impact, the components examined revealed no preimpact failures, and
there was no previous record of malfunctions. The evidence indicates that the pilot
probably recognized the unwanted descent at the last moment and that he attempted to
return the alrplane to climbing flight. The Initial ground contact Involved primarily the
propellers cutting sagebrush until the airplane passed through the fence a few seconds
later. The alrplane c auld not have had a high rate of descent at that time or there should
have been extensive ground sears and gouges, and separation of airframe parts. The
airplane remained in the air for about 450 feet after striking the fence, until the first
principal ground contact was made. The only airplane parts in the initial contact area
were the right-engine propeller dome and a piece of right-engine cowling. These pieces
separated when the right engine hit the fenee post. Therefore, the Safety Board
concludes that the airplana&#x27;s descent was virtually nil, and the pilot had nearly recovered
from the descent when the propellers touched the sagebrush and when the right engine
struck the fence. The Safety Board believes that the reason for the unwanted descent was
not @ problem that prevented ascent; rather, it apparently involved a mroblem that was
not recognized in sufficient time to prevent the initial descent and to recever completely. Consequently, the Safety Board concludes that uncontrollable mechanical faflures
probably were rot the reason for tha Joss of altitude. Runaway trim.--Alrplane design ecitecia specify that the pilot be able to

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] However, there were continuous pilot reported discrepancies
concerning the autopilot which the Safety Board believes were not associated with the
previous maintenance performed. The discrepancies concerned roll oscillation,
“wandering” with the heading and altitude hold modes engaged, and the yaw damper’s
possible contribution to these control difficulties. The discrepancies could have
constituted a nuisance in flight and most likely resulted in the pilots avoiding the use of
the autopilot. It was reportedly placarded inoperative by a pilot who delivered the
aircraft to the current owner. A reported aileron misrigging could be attributed to the
change in flight control surface balance after the aircraft had been painted. ‘i..ce a
review of the maintenance records for June, July, and August 1981 did not disclose that
any of the previously reported open discrepancies had been corrected, the Safety Board
concludes that these problems probably continued to exist and that the aircraft had not
been properly maintained since April 1981. The previously reported intermittent pressurization problem could have been a
factor in the accident. Although the autopilot discrepancies could have caused thie
flightcrew to avoid using it, there is no speed restriction on operation without an autopilot
es there is with later model Learjets, which have a speed limit of 0.78 M,- However, use
of the autopilot in turbulent air would assist in stabilizing the aircraft. Additionally, if
the yaw damper had failet or malfunctioned, control of the aircraft could have been
extremely difficult under turbulent conditions.

2.3 Loss of Control

The area in which the aircraft was transiting at PL 450 was characterized by a
confluent zone of polar and subtropical jet streams. Based upon 2-minute average winds,
the upper air sounding at Amarillo showed wind shear changes of greater than 6 knots per
1,000 feet at FL 450. The wind shears east of the aircraft&#x27;s course over Dodge City were
slightly less than 6 knots per 1,000 feet. Also, the aircraft was well within 6,000 feet of
the tropopause, 4 transition zone between the troposphere and stratosphere, and a region
where clear air turbulence is likely to be encountered. The weather pattern would have
been conducive to moderate, and possibily severe clear air turbulence at FL 450. Considering these conditions and the accepted guidetines for turbulence forecasting, the
Safety Board believes that a turbulence forecast should have been issued with the aviation
area forecast. A turbulence SIGMET is not generally issued unless a pilot reports
encountering turbulence, and there were no pilot reports of turbulence for 3 hours before
the accident. However, it should be noted that there was no other traffic in the area at
FL 450 for at least 30 minutes before the accident. The radar computer data showed that the aircraft was flying level at FL 451
and on course for 2 minutes before there was a disturbance In Its cruise altitude at
1456:21 and the aircraft suddenly climbed 100 feet.</div>

react quickly and appropristely, it elso may have been impossible to recover from such a
maneuver. According to the SCR report, the stall speed margins in many of the
unmodified wing Model 24 aircraft have been found t) be inadequate, Maintenance of the
Stall warning and pusher system is therefore critica: to the safety of flight. It is possible
that this system in the accident aircraft may not have been properly adjusted since the
aircraft had not been recently inspected in accord:ace with the manufacturer&#x27;s
recommended or FAA approved maintenance program. The Safety Bord could not conclusively rule out the possibility of flightcrew
incapacitation as a factor in this accident because of the previous reported cabin
pressurization problem. However, only about 1 minute 46 seconds elapsed between the
time of the initial altitude excursion and the uncontrolled descent from FL 450. The
aircraft descended 1 minute after this initial altitude excursion which is believed to have
been caused by an encounter with clear air turbulence, Additionally, the evidence
Suggests that at some point during the upset and descent, the flightcrew deployed the
spoilers. Therefore, the Safety Board, believes it was unlikely that the uncontrolled
descent was caused by flightcrew incapacitaticn.,

Since the Learjet hes characteristics which could lead to critical contro}}
problems in the high altitude, high speed regime of flight, complex compensating features
were Incorporated into the flight control system or required by Federal aviation
regulations to provide for an appropriate leve) of safety. The integration of these
compensating features vith the aircraft&#x27;s primary flight control system requires strict
adherence to sound maintenance practices to operate the aircraft safely. The minimum
maintenance, accerded the aircraft while it was rapidly changing hands could have
compromised this level of safety. Owners and operators must familiarize themselves
sufficiently with newly acquired aircraft, Feders! reguiations, and maintenance programs
to insure that aircraft are properly inaintaiied. This responsibility also extends to
insuring compliance with all pertinent airworthiness directives and acquiring all pertinent
service bulletins, flight manual, and service manual revisions, as appropriate. Because the
AFM recovered from the wreckage did not include any of the current vevisions and the
revisions were not located elsewhere in the wreckage, the Safety Board believes that tne
flighterew probably did not have a current AFM aboard the aircraft. Although this

appropriate increase in power or exchanged for excess airspeed, the airplane can rapidly entur a stall
condition. Moreover, if the pitch increase is mace rapidly enough the alrptane can enter an
accelerated stall at an airspeed significantly higher than its norma! 1.0G stall speed. Correlation of the accident site terrain features, impact marks, airplane geometry, and damage
to the right wing tip indicated that the airplane was in right bank of 30° or greater and that its
flightpath angle was 5” or greater when it struck the ground 643 feet short of the runway threshold
and 86 feet below a normal 3°-approach path. The Safety Board believes the evidence confirms that
the pilot flew an unstabilized approach at a steep angle and at a fairly high rate of descent. This
resulted in the airplane sinking below the normal approach path requiring the pilot to arrest the
rate of descent at the last minute. in fact, a witness reported that the nose of the airplane rose up
quickly, and the airplane then rolled to the right when he observed It comig toward him. This
suggests the pilot may have suddenly increased the pitch attitude to arrest the rate of descent and
attempted to extend the approach ath or that he attempted to make a go-around before jatera!
and directional control was lost. The evidence further suggests that the loss of control could have
been the result of a stall. The Safety Board determined that the wing flaps were up at the time the right wing struck the
ground at the site of initial impact. This was inconsistent with the procedures used by the carrier, in
thet the approach flap setting of 37.5 percent was normally used. Moreover, this finding was
contrary to the manner in which the captain reportedly flew visual approaches using full flaps. Finding the flaps retracted at irnpact suggests that either the flightcrew failed to extend the flaps,
they intentionally executed a no-flap approach, they mishandled the operation of the flaps, or the
flaps bled up during the approach. Given the subsequent reported sarvice difficulties with the flaps experienced by the carrier, it is
possible that the flaps bled up during the rapid descent. However, full retraction of the flaps during

an approach had not been previously reported or documented; only a small amount of flap
retraction movement had been experienced. Since the flap service difficulty history did not come to
the Safety Board&#x27;s attention until several months after the accident, it was unable to determine if
there was a problem with some component(s) of the system because the wreckage had been
released for salvage and later disposed. However, examination did not disclose -vidence of a failure,
malfunction, or feaks in the flap hydraulix system. Since uncommanded flap movement had only
amounted to 3 to § percent, the Safety Board would have expected to find some extension of the
flaps at impact unless the pilot had intentionally or unintentionally made a no-flap approach.</div>

in the C-212 until the airspeed is reduced below stall speed and the airplane is on landing rollout. However, a rapid increase in airplane pitch attitude might cause this condition to occur at airspeeds
above the airplane&#x27;s stall speed because the rapid increase in pitch attitude would significantly
increase the angle of attack on the propellers momentarily causing the propeller governors to
rapidly reduce the blade angles in order to maintain constant engine RPM. The rapid reduction in
blade angles coutd, therefore, cause a rapid asymmetric thrust reversal with the left propeller
constrained by the low pitch stop and the right propeller blade angle reduced to a lower thrust
condition. Moreover, forward movement of the Pls under these circumstances, a conditioned response to a
rapid increase in pitch attitude at approach airspeeds, would have aggravated the asymmetric thrust
reversal because with the higher blade angle on the left propeller, it wouid have immediately begun
producing significantly more thrust than the right propeller with its lower flight idle blade angle. In consideration of all the evidence related to the operation, maintenance, and postaccident
condition of the right engine and propeller on the airplane, the Safety Board concludes that the
series of trial-and-error maintenance actions performed during the 3 days preceding the accident
most likely resulted in the misadjustment of propeller’s flight idle low pitch stop to a degree
significantly below the setting prescribed by the manufacturer. Additionally, although the pitot, in
an attempt to salvage approach, flew an unstabilized and steep landiny approach that resulted in a
rapid increase in pitch attitude at a relatively low altitude that may have aggravated the situation by
placing the airplane near an accelerated stall condition, the Safety Board concludes that the pilot&#x27;s
actions probably would have resulted in either a successful flanding or tissed approach had the right
engine and propeller been adjusted properly. finally, the Safety Board concludes that the improper

maintenance performed on the right engine and propeller during the 3 days preceding the accident
relates directly to the cause of the accident.

24 Aircraft Maintenance

The Safety Board&#x27;s investigation disclosed a number of discrepancies in the carrier&#x27;s maintenance
practices. Regarding the maintenance department&#x27;s actions, the Board believes that there was a
failure to troubleshoot the pilot-reported discrepancies correctly. This poor performance led to
unnecessary and time-consuming maintenance tasks that aggravated the carrier&#x27;s maintenance
difficulties. The carrier was averaging about seven flights per day per airplane with most flights
lasting less than 1 hour based on its flight schedule.</div>

prescribed timits. The weather wa3 not a factor in the accident,

The airport facilities, personnel, and equipment involved operated normally and were not
factors in the accident. The pilot made an unstabilized approach at a relatively steep angle and at a high rate of
descent resulting in the airplane sinking below a normal approach path to the runway. The pilot experienced an asymmetric power condition as the airplane was slowed rapidly in his
attempt to arrest a high rate of descent and to salvage the approach or to initiate a go-around
maneuver. The retracted position of the flaps could have been a factor in the accident and could have
contributed to a stall. The pilat lost control of the airplane at an altitude from which recovery could not have been
accomplished. Standards for inherent aerodynamic qualities are probably not adequate for providing stall
warning in new aircraft used in new aircraft used in 14 CFR Parts 135 and
12i-passenger-carrying operations. The impact forces and the destruction of the cockpit made the accident unsurvivable for the
flightcraw. The impact forces were survivable for the passengers because the structural integrity of the
cabin was maintained, the seats remained attached to the floor tracks, and passengers used
their seatbelts which remained intact. The carrier&#x27;s management and supervision of the maintenance department personnel was
deficient. The FAA FSD0&#x27;s Initial certification of the carrier was deficient in the area of maintenance
recordkeeping. The bilateral type certification program of the CASA C-212 was not managed effectively by the
FAA. The reorganizational changes, personnel changes, and the limited availability of
resources within the engineering and operations departments of FAA are cortributing factors. 3.2 Probable Cause

The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probavle cause of the accident
was improper maintenance in setting propeller flight idle blade angle and engine fuel flow resulting
in @ loss of contral from an asymmetric power condition. A factor contributing to the accident was
the pilot&#x27;s unstabilized visual approach.

4, RECOMMENDATIONS

As a result of the Fischer Bros. accident in Romulus, Michigan, on March 4, 1987, the Safety Board
issued Safety Recommendations A-87-27 and -28 to the FAA:

A-87-27

Issue a gerreral notice (GENOT) immediately to all U.S. owners and operators of the
CASA €-212 airplane describing the background and significant findings of the
recent flight test of the CASA C-212. The notice should provide an evaluation of
the exitting CASA C-212 stall characteristics, operational precautions, and training
procedures to prectude inadvertent stalls until an approved artificial stall warning
system is installed. A-87-28

Expedite the rulemaking action to require installation of an artificial stall warning
system on the CASA C-212 airglanes. On June 16, 1987, the FAA responded to these recommendations stating that for Safety
Recommendation A-87-27, the FAA had issued a GENOT to al! flight standards field offices
addressing the flight characteristics of the CASA 212 aircraft.</div>

airspeed fluctuations of +20 knots to -44 knots and downdrafts from 15 to 40 fps. as it
descended through the heavy rain. Consequently, the Safety Board concludes that the
flighterew probably believed that the airplane had penetrated the worst of the windshear,
that the airplane would emerge shortly from the heavy rain, and that continuation of the —
_ approach was warranted. Also, it concludes that these beliefs may have been prompted by .
the flightcrew&#x27;s wind shear training and simulator experience in which they had
successfully flown through microburst demonstrations that had incorporated the classic
- downburst outflow with its increasing headwind, downdraft, and decreasing headwind, and
- subsequent restabilization of the aircraft.

7 Based on his wind shear training and L-1011 simulator experience with wind
_ shear encounters, the captain&#x27;s decision to continue the approach was understandable
following momentary stabilization of the airplane above 500 feet AGL at 1805:31. However, within the next several seconds, the flight encountered a second severe
disturbance subsequently identified as the vortex ring consisting of large variations in
wind components along all three axes of the airplane. Indicated airspeed decreased from
. 140 to 120 knots, the vertical. wind reversed from a 40-fps downdraft to a 20-fps updraft,
and a severe lateral gust struck the airplane. This gust resulted in a very rapid roll to the
right, which required almost full lateral flight control authority to counter and to level
the wings. Consequently, the airplane&#x27;s angle of attack increased from 6° to
approximately 23° degrees, and most likely increased more rapidly, and to a higher value,
than recorded by the DFDR because of the rate-limited angle of attack sensors. .The
_ severe environment that flight 191 encountered during the 5 seconds after 1805:31 most
. likely prompted the captain to say, &quot;Hang onto the (nonpertinent.word)&quot; at 1805:36.. Also,
at this time, the flighterew probably first considered the execution of a missed approach,
but they were likely too occupied with the immediate task of maintaining control of the
airplane in the turbulence to audibly express these thoughts. However, engine thrust had
been applied and the airplane momentarily rose slightly above the ILS lideslope. Six.
seconds after the captain&#x27;s above comment, with engine thrust at or near maximum, the
airplane began a rapid descent which was not arrested until ground contact 10. seconds
later, at 1805:52. The Safety Board believes that the audible command TOGA issued by
_the captain 3 seconds after the glideslope departure, and 9 seconds after maximum. thrust
had been applied, may have been confirmation of the missed approach and an indication
_ that he had switched the flight director from the approach/land mode to the TOGA mode. The Safety Board is coneerned that the present training within the industry for
wind shear encounters on the final approach seems to advocate the philosophy that the
retrieval of the approach profile is the desired end result and not escape from the
environment.</div>

and the first officer retarded the throttles. By 1805:15, all three engines were either ‘at,
or very near, flight idle EPR. During the first part of this period, the first officer ‘also
had applied a gradual nose-down control correction. The pitch attitude decreased from
about 4° nose-up to 1.3° nose-up and then began to increase as the first officer began to
apply nose-up control corrections. At or shortly before 1805:19, the airplane encountered
a strong downdraft. The vertical winds changed from a 10- -fps updraft to a 20-fps
downdraft. The first officer&#x27;s response was to apply further nose-up control correction,
and the pitch attitude increased to about 7° nose-up. At 1805:19, as the airplane entered
heavy rain, the captain warned the first officer, &quot;watch your speed,&quot; which was followed
almost immediately by the more definitive comment, &quot;you&#x27;re gonna lose it all of a sudden,

there it is.&quot; The airplane performance analysis shows this comment referred. to a
significant loss (44 knots) of indicated airspeed in 10 seconds as the airplane traversed the
increasing headwind, followed by downdraft, and then by decreasing headwind wind shear. Since the captain was familiar with this type of wind shear from recurrent ground and
simulator training and based on information provided in Delta&#x27;s L-1011 POM, the Safety
Board concludes that, although he may not have anticipated an encounter with a
microburst, the captain was quick to recognize its manifestations. The Safety Board
concludes also from the captain&#x27;s commands to push the power up--&quot;way up, way up, way
up&quot;--following the predicted loss of airspeed, that he was familiar with the actions
needed to restabilize the airplane on the glideslope. At 18:05:29, as the airplane was descending through about 650 feet AGL, the
decreasing trend of the headwind reversed itself which, along with a high thrust condition,
resulted in a rapid increase in airspeed from about 129 to 140 KIAS. As.-a result, at
18:05:31, thrust was reduced (from an engine pressure ratio of 1.47 to 1.33) to counter the
rapidly increasing airspeed. The airplane momentarily stabilized on the glideslope despite
airspeed fluctuations of +20 knots to -44 knots and downdrafts from 15 to 40 fps. as it
descended through the heavy rain. Consequently, the Safety Board concludes that the

wind shear encounters on the final approach seems to advocate the philosophy that the
retrieval of the approach profile is the desired end result and not escape from the
environment. For example, the landing wind shear procedures in the Delta L-1011 POM
advised the pilot &quot;to be prepared to apply thrust immediately to maintain a minimum of
Vref when encountering the shear and to be prepared for a prompt reduction of. thrust
once norma! target speed and glide path is reestablished.&quot; The Safety Board believes that
training should emphasize that in an environment wherein extreme pitch attitude changes
and large applications of engine thrust are required to maintain altitude and.minimum
airspeeds, flighterews should be taught that the only objective of the procedure is to
escape and thereafter place the maximum distance between the ground and the airplane
as soon as possible. In this regard, the Safety Board notes that the revision to the Delta
wind shear procedures issued after the accident provides Delta flighterews with additional
criteria to determine when the airplane&#x27;s flight path control has become destabilized... The
revised procedures advise the flighterews to be prepared to execute a missed approach
below 1,000 feet AGL if they encounter either &quot;severe turbulence or indications . of
unstabilized flight path eontrol.&quot;

Airplane Control During Microburst Penetration.--Delta and most major -air

. @arriers taught their flightcrews to trade airspeed for altitude if they inadvertently
encountered low-altitude wind shear. This technique was practiced in the simulators,
including the L-1011 simulators, and flighterews were taught to increase the airplane&#x27;s
pitch attitude and to add maximum thrust if necessary to control the airplane&#x27;s flightpath. If necessary to avoid ground contact, the pitch attitude could be increased until the
stickshaker activated and then decreased slightly to an attitude which would silence the
stickshaker. Thereafter, the airplane&#x27;s pitch attitude should be kept at an attitude just
below that which would reactivate the stickshaker until the end of the wind shear area
was traversed. The first officer was apparently able to apply the above techniques to keep the
airplane on the ILS glideslope as it passed through and beyond the initial portion of .the
microburst. When the airplane descended into the vortex, the combination of an airspeed
loss of 20 KIAS and a strong updraft most likely caused a momentary (1-second)
activation of the stickshaker. The Safety Board believes that the first officer acted
reflexively when the stickshaker activated to exert a 20- to 25-pound forward push on the
control column. This control column force and the longitudinal stability of the airplane
resulted in the airplane nosing over to a -8.5° pitch attitude, a rapid departure from the
ILS glideslope, and a descent rate which approached 5,000 fpm for an instant.</div>

interpretation of instrument impact markings, the Safety Board was unable to
determine which pitch witness marks occurred at initial ground impact and which
marks were made during secondary impact(s). Therefore, the Safety Board cannot
positively determine whether the captain&#x27;s ADI was malfunctioning and was a causal
element in this accident sequence. Nor can the Safety Board rule out the possibility
that the ADI malfunctioned and precipitated the loss of control by the captain.

2.10 The Recovery Attempt

There is little doubt that there was accurate attitude information
available to the crew, at least from the standby artificial horizon. The display half of
the standby artificial horizon displayed an attitude corresponding to that of impact. Further, it is believed that the first officer&#x27;s ADI was accurate because of his recovery
efforts. His response to the captain&#x27;s release of control was not only immediate (0.7

36

seconds), but it was correct in general execution. The flightpath study indicates that
at the time control of the airplane was transferred, the bank angle had increased to
about 65 degrees, and the flightpath angle was about -15 degrees. The altitude at the
time was about 3,100 feet. The Safety Board&#x27;s research indicates that the descent
angle continued to steepen. Within 4 seconds of the first officer stating, I got it,” the
angle of the bank stabilized at about 80 degrees, the altitude was about 2,600 feet and
the flightpath angle was about -28 degrees. The first officer correctly concentrated
on trying to level the wings for the next 3 seconds. Then, as the bank angle
approached 20 degrees, he began focusing on arresting the descent. Eventually, in
the 12 seconds after he acknowledged assuming control, he recovered the airplane to
the 15 degrees left bank, and the -17 degrees flightpath present at the time of impact. There are several points to be emphasized in evaluating the recovery
attempt. Airline pilots are not periodically trained to recover from unusual attitudes
as are military pilots or civilian acrobatic pilots. The presumption is that an airline
pilot should avoid an unusual attitude and will never have a need to recover from one. Similarly, transport-category aircraft operations contrast with the military and civilian
acrobatic method of flying an airplane. Airline pilots may subconsciously avoid
abrupt maneuvers in the interest of passenger comfort. In this regard, the first officer
had no military and little, if any, acrobatic flight training. Although the captain was a
retired Naval Aviator, he last flew a military airplane in 1979, about 13 years prior to
the accident. There was no indication recorded on the CVR that the captain was
physically involved in the recovery maneuver at all. Once he relinquished control, he
did not even &quot;coach&quot; anymore, until 2 seconds before impact when he joined the
flight engineer in saying, “Up, up....&quot;

The first officer took control of the airplane at approximately 0325:50. However, the captain&#x27;s difficulties were signaled about 10 seconds before he asked
“You got it?&quot; The Safety Board believes that the captain verbalized his confusion at
0325:39 with his &quot;What&#x27;s the matter?” query. Also, the airplane exceeded a 30degree bank angle at around 0325:41. Because 30 degrees is the steepest bank angle
used in normal! transport fiying, the captain&#x27;s continued roll into a steeper bank should
have alerted the first officer that he needed to challenge the captain&#x27;s performance. The Safety Board believes that the accident might have been prevented if the first
officer had corrected or challenged the captain&#x27;s overbank in the 10 seconds between
the first signal of trouble and the captain&#x27;s transfer of control statement. The Safety Board was unable to determine the moment when the first
officer detected that the captain was overbanking and unable to control the airplane.

57

Likewise, the Safety Board was unable to determine whether the first officer&#x27;s poor
performance on the preceding ILS approaches made him hesitant either to speak up
and alert the captain to his deviation from normal flight attitude or to intervene and
correct it. However, the Safety Board believes that this accident highlights the need
for active crew coordination and interaction to avoid having the flying pilot exceed
flight limitations, such as airspeed, pitch, and bank angles. The circumstances further
emphasize the importance of timely action in challenging or correcting fellow
crewmembers. Lastly, the basic control manipulations by the first officer during the
recovery attempt were in general accordance with accepted procedures in that he
attempted to roll the wings level and then began pulling the nose up. If he had been
more aggressive with both sets of controls, he might have succeeded. A larger, more
rapid aileron input would have leveled the wings faster; and a more aggressive
pullout could have been within the operating envelope of the aircraft. Even if he had
exceeded the approved g load for the DC-8, a large safety margin existed to preclude
structural failure in extreme situations. Obviously, this situation called for extremely
quick and aggressive control inputs.

2.11 Cockpit Resource Management on Flight 805

The Safety Board notes that the manner in which the flightcrew
interacted in the latter stages of this flight was not consistent with .idely accepted
CRM principles. Although it was impossible to determine how the pilots related to
each other during their previous flight segments, activities in the cockpit for the last
30 minutes of the flight were more representative of an instructor/student than a
teamwork situation. Cockpit conversation and interaction were one-sided, in that the
captain was dominating the conversation and making all the decisions conceming the
flight until the first officer assumed control of the airplane after the loss of control.</div>

problem on the second approach. ATI 815 landed at 0117, and the first officer
noticed the captain&#x27;s flight director oscillate from one dot fly up to one dot fly down. It did not affect the approach, and they made a normal landing. The ILS anomalies experienced by the crews appear to be so random
that they could be explained by many variations, both in the transmitter and the
receiver/displays. Based on tre information presented, some of the needle movement
might be the normal fluctuation when the receiver first responds (particularly in
ATI819 and ATI815). The two most perplexing problems were those of both B-727100s (AJT 803 and AJT 701). The problem that AJT701 had with the ILS was
sufficient to cause that flight to abort the approach. Despite extensive effort, the
Safety Board could not determine the cause for the problems noted with the ILS. There was no discussion of glideslope indication problems on the CVR
during the approaches, and the crew reported that they, &quot;...lost the localizer
course...we had the glidepath but not the localizcr.&quot; In addition, ground and airborne
checks of the ILS equipment by the FAA following the accident revealed no
anomalies. Accordingly, the ILS is not considered to have been a factor in the
accident.

59 3. CONCLUSIONS Findings

1. The flightcrew was properly certificated and qualified for the
flight in accordance with existing regulations.

2. The airplane was properly certificated and maintained in
accordance with existing regulations.

3. The first officer was flying the airplane upon arrival into the
Toledo area. For undetermined reasons, he failed to properly capture
the ILS localizer and/or glideslope during two ILS approaches.

4, The captain assumed control of the airplane during the second
missed approach; however, he apparently became spatially
disoriented, from physiological factors and/or a failed attitude
director indicator, and he inadvertently allowed an unusual attitude to
develop with bank angles up to 80 degrees and pitch angles up to 25
degrees.

5. The captain transferred control of the airplane to the first
officer when the airplane was nose low and in a left bank angie;
however, there may have been a short period of time when neither
pilot was in control.

6, The first officer assumed control and began leveling the wings
and raising the nose of the airplane, but impact with the ground
occurred before the unusual attitude recovery was completed.

7. The operability of the captain&#x27;s attitude director indicator at the
time control was lost is uncertain. Witness marks on the one attitude
director indicator ball that was found could have indicated an
incorrect position at impact; however, the evidence was inconclusive.

8. Based on the observed performance of the airplane during the
recovery, the first officer&#x27;s attitude director indicator was operating

properly. 3.2 Probable Cause

The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable
cause of this accident was the failure of the flightcrew to properly recognize or
recover in a timely manner from the unusual aircraft attitude that resulted from the
captain&#x27;s apparent spatial disorientation, resulting from physiological factors and/or a
failed attitude director indicator.</div>

meteorological data indicated that the airplane probably was flying at a consezvative
cruise speed of about 0.77 M. The copilot immediately acknowledged the desecnt
clearanze, but the airplane did not descend until 28 to 41 seconds later. The copilot may
have believed it necessary to inform ATC of the delay, which could explain her report
1 minute 27 seconds later, at 1157:00, &quot;One hundred Tango Alpha descending now.&quot;

However, the airplane had already descended 1,000 feet when the report was made, which
may indicate that the crew had been or was distracted by sone other event. The radar
data indicated that the airplane descended to 39,600 feet at 1157:13. The next radar
signal received, at 1157:25, indicated that the airplane had climbed back to 41,000 feet. From this position, the airplane began a maneuver which consisted of two long-period
longitudinal oscillations and descended to an altitude of 4,200 feet, where radar contact
with the airplane was lost. The radar data indicated that the airplane&#x27;s track during the
descent varied but stayed within 10° of its course. Based on the relationship between the last radar contact and the accident site,
the airplane apparently maintained about the same angle of descent, about 68° from
12,000 feet until impact with the ocean. The data showed that the airplane&#x27;s track was
245° magnetic, but the wreckage site was in the direction of 135° magnetic from ths last
radar contact. Assuming the radar data to be accurate, it is therefore probable that the
airplane was in a right spiral at the time it struck the water. This is supported by the
wreckage examination which disclosed that the airplane was in a steep nosedown, right
wing down attitude at the time of impact. Examination of the flight profile derived from the radar data indicated that
several obvious anomalies occurred. First, the airplane climbed back to FL 410 when it
should have leveled at FL 350, indicating a pitchup problem. Second, after returning to
FL 410, the airplane entered an uncontrolled descent. In order to explain these anomalies,
several hypotheses were considered. These hypotheses included a flight control
melfunction, a cabin depressurization, a turbulence upset, a low speed buffet excursion,
and a high speed buffet excursion. While a pitchup problem in the autopilot had occurred several months after the
AD, which had been issued to prevent an autopilot pitch axis malfunction, had been
accomplished on the airplane, the autopilot reportedly had been corrected. Since it was
reported that the pilots normally used the autopilot in cruise flight and since there were
no other known outstanding discrepancies with the device, it is reasonable to believe that
it was used during cruise flight and the initial part of the descent to FL 390.</div>

transponder to the emergency code of 7700 is also required in order to alert ATC. However, wreckage examination showed that the spoilers and landing gear were retracted
at impact. Also, the transponder had not been switched to the emergency code. With regard to the possibility of a turbulence encounter leading to an upset,
two past high altitude loss of control accidents involving Series 20 Leesjets were
attributed to clear air turbulence encounters. In one of the accidents, the Northeast Jet
Company Learjet 25D accident cited previously, a clear air turbulence encounter was
verified, and it led to an overspeed condition and loss of control Although turbulence was
not reported by another Learjet transiting the area at the time of N100TA&#x27;s accident,
analysis of the meteorological conditions disclosed the potential for moderate to severe
clear air turbulence. Based on the Safety Board&#x27;s analysis, the upper atmospheric
structure was similar to, but not as well defined as, the upper atmospheric structure
which existed in the Northeast Jet Company accident. An encounter with clear air
turbulence could have resulted in either a high speed departure or low speed departure
from descending cruise flight. If the pilots had reacted to a turbulen-e upset with a
sudden maneuver which increased the load factor, the airplane may have decelerated into
the low speed buffet boundary and entered an uncontrollable wing roll-off. a steep
nosedown split &quot;S&quot; type maneuver, and a high speed dive. Recovery from a maneuver of
this type could be difficult and perhaps impossible because of the high nosedown pitching
moments associated with flight beyond M,,o. With respect to a high speed buffet excursion or overspeed condition, it would
have been very easy for tne airplane to have accelerated 0.05 Mach to M O (0.82 M)
during the initial descent from FL 410. The airplane descended at a rate of about
700 feet per minute in the 47- to 59~-second interval between the time it left FL 410 and
the time of the copilot’: last transmission. Control difficulties could have resulted if the
crew had allowed tie airplane to accelerate beyond M O into an overspeed condition
because of the nosedown pitching moments associated wil Speeds in excess of the critical
Mach number for the airplane. Considering the potential conditions for moderate to
severe clear air turbulence, a gust upset of sufficient intensity could also have resulted in
an overspeed. According to the ~ “A&#x27;s SCR report, a production error in the copilot&#x27;s
pitot static system, an error resulung in the static sources not being flush with the
fuselage, or a malfunction of the system could be contributing factors leading to an
overspeed. As previously reported in other high altitude loss of control accidents,
abnormal pitch forces and a severe roll control problem could have been encountered
without warning if such conditions had existed. The outcome of an overspeed condition is
greatly dependent upon the pilot&#x27;s reactions. An abrupt noseup elevator control input to
slow the airplane from a descending overspeed would aggravate the condition by
increasing the local Mach effects on the wing (&quot;aileron buzz&quot;) and could have resulted in
the loss of roll contro. Such control inputs might also cause separation of an aileron.</div>

the point where it would have become impossible to recover the eirplane. An overspeed
encounter could explain the apparent rushed delivery of the copilot&#x27;s last transmission, the
warning horn sound, and the crew&#x27;s failure to respond to subsequent calls by ATC. However, the radar and meteorological data are not fully consistent with an
overspeed condition, nor is the postaccident noseup trim position of the stabilizer
actua’or jackscrew. It appears that the airplane made a significant reduction in speed

from about 238 KIAS/0.80 M at 1155:25 to about 220 KIAS/0.74 hat 1156:13, when the
airplane began the descent. The speed appears to have stabilized during the ext
48 seconds until a further speed reduction to about 207 KIAS/0.69\M at 1157:13. This
apparently was the speed of the airplane before it climbed back to 44,100 feet. The data
contradict, to some degree, a possible overspeed encounter and a gonclusion that the
warning horn sound was that of the Mach overspeed warning. This of dourse is predicated
on the assumption that the Mach overspeed warning ‘was properly calikrated. However,
without other supportive evidence, it is difficult to conclude with dertainty that an
overspeed condition did not exist, because the accuravy of the derived i

and Mach numbers are dependent on accurate wind and temperature Information and
accurate radar data points. For the foregoing reasons, the Safety Bédard was not able to
probable cause of the accident. The lack of CVR and FDR data ‘preven
determination of the problems the pilots&#x27; might have encountered, ‘and the airplane&#x27;s
flightpath and speed. Because the airplane was destroyed and critiéal ft
system components were either destroyed or not recoverea, the possibility .of
system malfuaction could not be eliminated. Also, without more definitive inf
the Safety Board could not rule out the possibility of a cabin decompression. ThaSafety
Bourd believes that the potential for moderate to severe clear air turbulence existed at
the time of the accident. However, the Safety Board could not determine if the aifplane
encountered tnis phenomenon. If such an encounter occurred, it could have been either a
causal or contributing factor in an upset and failure to recover.</div>

pushed the disconnect button, or when he overrode it by pulling back on the control yoke.
{{ the autopilot malfunctioned and initlated the descent, or the pilot made an improper
input once he recognized the deviation, he would have disconnected the autopilot eitiner
by overciding it or pushing the disconnect. Again, the evidence is inconclusive and
therefore, the role of the autopilot in the events of this aceident cannot be reasonably
assessed. Airframe _icing.--The Safety Board also cons.cered the possibility that
airframe ice was the reason for the unwanted descent. The meteorological conditions
were conducive to ice cccumulations and the pilots of Frontier Plight 815 reported that
they encountered feing curing thelr approach a few minutes before Sun West Flight 104&#x27;s
approach. However, N41070 was certificated and equipped for flight into known feing
conditions and the existing conditions were not so severe that. they should have caused
serious problems. The pitot of Flight 104 should have been able to cope easily with the
existing conditions. Therefore, although it Is possible that the pilot failed to remove ice
buildups during the approach, and the resultant adverse aerodynamic effects resulted in
the unwanted descent, the Safety Boar believes such factors ave not likely in this case. Intentional maneuver.~-Another possibility considered by the Safety Board,
which could account for t+: ocoservations of the survivor and the ground observers,
involves the possibility tha. the pilot intentionally pushed the nose over to &quot;duck under”
and remain visval in an attempt to fly a circling approach to runway 20. A cireling
approach would involve a turn eway from the runway followed by a reverse turn beck to
the runway. Sinea tne winds were calm, the pilot could have landed on the runway in
either direction. The possibility that the pilot saw the terminal area as he passed by
suppo:ts speculation that the pilot may have contemplated or even attempted such a
rhaneuver; however, he was well aware of the surrounding terrain features and therefore
would not be expected to attempt such a maneuver by losing altitude. -

~17-

Attitude Inclicator,--Another explanation for the unwanted descent could be
mechanical failure of the attltude indicator or failure of the pilot to maintain a positive
climb indication by use of the attitude gyro, Attitude indicator gyros can exhibit
precession as a result of neceleration forces. The typical precession error during
longitudinal (forward) acceleration will produce a false nose-high indication momentarily. However, the allowable tolerance for a properly functioning gyro of the type installed in
N41070 is so small that precession error should not have been sufficient to have caused
noticeable effects unless there wes a malfunction. There was no evidence to suggest such
a malfunction, although the gyro could not be tested because of impact and fire damage. However, since the pilot maneuvered accurately to the VOR, the attitude indicator was
probably operating properly. A mechanical failure precisely at the time of the missed
approach is highly improbable.</div>

conditions could have affected adversely the pilot&#x27;s ability to maintain a olimb attitude,
and conversely could have allowed an unwanted descent to oecur. The pilot&#x27;s instrument
cross-check and visual seen would have included’ et least the following: attitude
indicator, heading Indicator, vertical speed Indicator, altimeter, engine instruments
(setting climb power » flap handle, gear handle, and possibly outside cues such as airport
lights or other objects. All of these items would have had to be scanned during the few
seconds immediately after the missed approach was initiated. The workload on the pilot
would have been extremely high during this short period and would have required precise
and timely perception, decisionmaking, and actions to effect a proper missed approach. Any distraction, such as the passenger&#x27;s scream about an airplane on the runway, any
misperception of cues, or any delayed action under these cireumstances could have caused
an unwanted descent that was not detected in time to évcid ground contact. The rate of
descent required to cause the accident is rather high and should have been readily
Apparent to the pilots however, it could have gone undetected for a few seconds, which
would have been sufficient to cause the accident. Physiological factors, --Sensory illusions, vertigo, or spatial disorlentation can
cause a pilot to not detect a deviation, to interpret cues incorrectly, to take inappropriate
action, or to take no action when action fs required. Any of these conditions can occur
during instrument flight; however, the possibility of them occurring Is greater at night,
during aircraft configuration changes, and when accelerations (aireraft maneuvering)
occur, i.e. turns, climbs, and power changes. Also, the transition from instrument
references to visual references and back to instrument references can induce illusions or
disorlentation. Moreover, if the pilot looked out the left wiadow in reaction to the
passenger&#x27;s screain about an airplane on the runway or because of his own sighting of the
ground or other features, the head and eye movemerts associated with this action could
nduce disorientation,

The ¢nly way for a pilot to overcome sensory Illusions {{s to monitor
continuously and to rely on the attitude indicator, and to cross-check the other flight
instruments, including the altimeter ar. vertical speed indicator, to verify that the
aircraft is performing as desired. Unfortunately, when a pilot Is experiencing !llustonary
events, the pilot may not detect an improper Instrument indication because the pliot’s
Sensory organs are sending false messages to the brain.</div>

are average rates of descent over the entire distance from the VOR to impact.

2.2 Possible Reasons for tire Descent

The Safety Board was not able to Jetermine why the airplane lost altitude and
crashed during the missed approach attempt. Several of the more likely possibilities were
considerad, but none of tham could be confirmed based on the available evidence. Mechanica) failure.--Flight control or trim malfunctions or flight insteumeut
failures could account for the unwanted descent; however, the damage to and destruction
of the flivht control components and flight instruments precluded a positive conelusicn
that they were functioning properly. However, the Safety Board believes that such
system malfunctions are improbable becuse the airplane was controllable until a few
seconds before impact, the components examined revealed no preimpact failures, and
there was no previous record of malfunctions. The evidence indicates that the pilot
probably recognized the unwanted descent at the last moment and that he attempted to
return the alrplane to climbing flight. The Initial ground contact Involved primarily the
propellers cutting sagebrush until the airplane passed through the fence a few seconds
later. The alrplane c auld not have had a high rate of descent at that time or there should
have been extensive ground sears and gouges, and separation of airframe parts. The
airplane remained in the air for about 450 feet after striking the fence, until the first
principal ground contact was made. The only airplane parts in the initial contact area
were the right-engine propeller dome and a piece of right-engine cowling. These pieces
separated when the right engine hit the fenee post. Therefore, the Safety Board
concludes that the airplana&#x27;s descent was virtually nil, and the pilot had nearly recovered
from the descent when the propellers touched the sagebrush and when the right engine
struck the fence. The Safety Board believes that the reason for the unwanted descent was
not @ problem that prevented ascent; rather, it apparently involved a mroblem that was
not recognized in sufficient time to prevent the initial descent and to recever completely. Consequently, the Safety Board concludes that uncontrollable mechanical faflures
probably were rot the reason for tha Joss of altitude. Runaway trim.--Alrplane design ecitecia specify that the pilot be able to

overcome ¢ Involved with runaway nosedown elevator trim. However, the
possibility existe that runaway trim could have occurred concurrently with the eleplane
configuration changes assoolated with the execution of the missed approach, and during a

performed the accident takeoff aggressively, the resulting AOA likely exceeded the stall AOA 
quickly and with little warning.75 
Although the pilot’s previous takeoffs occurred without incident, the pilot likely 
overcontrolled the airplane during the accident flight while performing the aggressive takeoff 
maneuver, which caused the airplane to enter an accelerated stall at an altitude between about 
100 and 200 ft. The airplane’s orientation and trajectory at the time of impact were consistent with 
a sharp turn and loss of control. Thus, the NTSB concludes that the pilot’s aggressive takeoff 
maneuver caused an accelerated stall and a subsequent loss of control at an altitude from which 
recovery was not possible. 
2.2.3 Left Wing Anomaly 
Examination of the airplane after the July 2016 accident showed that the left wing was 
twisted, as indicated by the wrinkles in the top skin of the wing (immediately outboard of the 
engine and aft of the forward spar). The wing twist likely occurred during the July 2016 accident 
given the high airframe stresses that the airplane sustained.76 The direction of wing twist indicated 
by the wrinkles was leading edge up for the wing tip. Because the left wing was twisted in the 
leading-edge-up direction, it had a higher angle of incidence than the right wing and thus a higher 
AOA during level flight.77 This higher angle of incidence could result in a tendency for the left 
 
74 These flight test data were considered acceptable compared with the requirements of Civil Aviation Regulations 
Part 3, the certification basis for the airplane. The Part 3 regulation was established in 1956. 
75 The FAA’s Airplane Flying Handbook stated that accelerated stalls could “surprise an inexperienced pilot.” 
76 On February 1, 2021, the NTSB received a photograph of the accident airplane from the airplane owner; the 
photograph was reportedly taken in January 2015. Although the photograph showed the left aileron trim tab downward 
deflection, the orientation of the airplane in the photograph did not allow the NTSB to assess the condition of the top 
skin in the left wing. 
77 According to an FAA glossary, an aircraft’s angle of incidence is “the acute angle formed between the chord 
line of an airfoil and the longitudinal axis of the aircraft on which it is mounted.”

3. Conclusions 3.1 Findings 
1. After making an intersection takeoff, the pilot conducted an intentional aggressive takeoff 
maneuver involving a low-altitude high-bank turn and simultaneous pitch-up maneuver. 
2. The airplane was likely operated near or possibly beyond the aft center of gravity limit during 
the accident takeoff. 
3. The pilot’s aggressive takeoff maneuver caused an accelerated stall and a subsequent loss of 
control at an altitude from which recovery was not possible. 
4. The twisted left wing that resulted from the airplane’s previous accident reduced the airplane’s 
stall margin, which likely caused the left wing to stall before the right wing and precipitated 
the airplane’s roll to the left. 
5. The pilot’s initial training did not provide him with adequate experience and proficiency for 
Beech King Air operations. 
6. By indicating that the accident pilot completed dual commercial flight instruction that he likely 
did not receive and by not providing initial training according to established standards, the 
pilot’s flight instructor showed a lack of professionalism and a disregard for aviation safety. 
7. The Beech King Air 65-A90 flight training that Oahu Parachute Center provided to new 
company pilots was insufficient and did not ensure that the accident pilot, who lacked training 
and experience in the airplane make and model, was prepared for the company’s parachute 
jump operations, which included the operation of the airplane near its aft center of gravity 
limit. 
8. The accident airplane was not airworthy because (1) it had not been properly repaired after the 
previous accident and (2) Oahu Parachute Center and its contract mechanic did not maintain 
the airplane in an airworthy condition. 
9. The airplane’s maintenance records were not kept in a manner that was consistent with the 
requirements of pertinent federal regulations. 
10. Oahu Parachute Center’s failure to address a safety hazard involving the airplane used for the 
company’s parachute jump operations, inconsistencies with applicable federal regulations, 
lack of standard operating procedures and structured pilot training, and flawed method for 
calculating the airplane’s center of gravity demonstrated the company’s inadequate safety 
management. 
11. The tandem instructor’s and the camera operator’s use of marijuana before the accident flight 
demonstrated their lack of judgment and professionalism given their safety responsibilities for 
the accident flight. NTSB

12. Even though Federal Aviation Administration inspectors accomplished the inspections of 
Oahu Parachute Center that the agency required, those inspections were insufficient for 
ensuring the safety of this commercial passenger-carrying operation. 3.2 Probable Cause 
The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of this 
accident was the pilot’s aggressive takeoff maneuver, which resulted in an accelerated stall and 
subsequent loss of control at an altitude that was too low for recovery.</div>

2.2.2 Airplane Performance 
Security camera video indicated that the airplane was inverted in a 45° nose-down attitude 
during the final moments of the accident flight. Examination of the accident site showed that the 
airplane’s left wing impacted the ground first. The FAA’s Airplane Flying Handbook (FAA-H-8083-3B) states that an airplane, at the 
same gross weight, airplane configuration, CG location, power setting, and environmental 
conditions, will consistently stall at the same indicated airspeed if no acceleration is involved.70 
The handbook also states that an airplane will stall at a higher indicated airspeed when the airplane 
is subject to excessive maneuvering loads, including steep turns, pull-up maneuvers, or other 
abrupt changes to the airplane’s flightpath. This type of stall is referred to as an “accelerated 
maneuver stall.” 
An accelerated stall can be encountered when a pilot increases the airplane’s angle of attack 
(AOA) rapidly. Accelerated stalls that result from abrupt maneuvers, such as the pilot’s aggressive 
pitch and bank during takeoff, tend to be more rapid or severe than unaccelerated (1-G) stalls and 
can occur at lower-than-anticipated pitch attitudes. A pilot’s failure to immediately address an 
accelerated stall can result in a loss of control. The NTSB used the available evidence from this investigation to calculate CG scenarios 
for the accident flight.71 With one passenger seated in the aft-facing copilot seat and all other 
passengers seated in the cabin on the two bench seats (discussed in section 1.3.5), the CG at 
takeoff, for an airplane weight of 7,925 pounds, would have been about 156.7 inches, which was 
within the airplane’s CG limits and was the forwardmost CG that could have existed during the 
accident flight.72 However, it is possible that the two parachutists who boarded the airplane late 
(just before departure) were not secured and that one or both camera operators, who had a financial 
incentive to record video footage during the flight, were unsecured and moving around the cabin. Under these conditions, the CG would have been farther aft. The NTSB located in the wreckage the 12 lift-latch buckle assemblies for the bench seats, 
8 of which were unlatched.</div>

could not redeploy the flaps to reduce the AOA because of the flaps 15 Vfe lockout. The second roll event was not terminated before the airplane rolled
1 and 1/4 times, and pitched down to a nearly vertical attitude. Further, throughout
the second roll event, the elevators were deflected in a primarily nose-up position by
both crewmembers, and the rudder was deflected most of the time from 2 to
3 degrees nose left. Although the crew was applying corrective rudder during the
roll excursion, the aileron inputs by the flightcrew were not sufficient to effect
recovery. Aileron control during this time was most likely very difficult and
confusing as a result of the multiple encounters with high control wheel forces and
unusual oscillatory aileron behavior associated with the aileron hinge moment
reversal.

197
When the crew relaxed the back pressure on the control column, thereby
reducing the nose-up elevator, the AOA decreased below the hinge moment reversal
threshold, and the crew regained control of the ailerons and initiated recovery at
6,000 feet. At this point, the airplane was in a very steep, high speed descent, in a
near-inverted attitude that would most likely have been unfamiliar to the crew,
considering their lack of unusual attitude recovery training in this airplane. The
FDR, CVR, and wreckage distribution data show that in the next 9 seconds, the crew
had leveled the wings and was bringing the nose up towards a level attitude. However, the airplane was moving at 375 KIAS with a load factor rapidly increasing
through 3.7 G when the outboard sections of the wings and the horizontal tail
separated from the airplane. At the time of the accident, the AMR Eagle pilot training program did
not include an &quot;unusual attitude&quot; or &quot;advanced maneuvers&quot; segment (nor was such
training required). During simulator training, AMR Eagle pilots were not exposed to
aircraft attitudes that were typically beyond those used for normal operations or
considered unusual, and they only experienced an abnormal pitch attitude when they
practiced emergency descents. Although both crewmembers of flight 4184 were
certified flight instructors,85 it is likely that this was the first time they had
experienced such unexpected and excessive roll and pitch attitudes in the ATR 72. Shortly after the upset, when the airplane rolled to an inverted position and
progressed into a steep nose-low attitude, the captain told the first officer to &quot;mellow
it out.&quot; However, there was no evidence on the CVR to indicate that the captain was
conveying information to the first officer about the airplane&#x27;s attitude, airspeed or
altitude. The lack of unusual attitude training may have significantly hampered
the immediate recovery of the airplane once the upset occurred.</div>

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] At 1525, as the airplane was entering the holding pattern, the propeller
speed was reduced to 77 percent. According to AMR Eagle procedures, this action is
consistent with the reduction of anti-icing/deicing systems to Level I, which is
appropriate only for flight outside of actual or potential icing conditions. The FDR indicated that at 1540, the Level III ice protection system was
activated and the propeller speed was increased to 86 percent. However, FDR data
also revealed that subsequently on two occasions during the holding pattern
preceding the initial upset, there was evidence of small drag increases that were
probably the result of ice accretions on the airplane. The first drag increase occurred
at approximately 1533 (about 24 minutes before the upset78) just before the flaps
were extended to 15 degrees. The second increase was evident at about 1551 (6
minutes before the upset). It is likely that the airplane intermittently encountered
areas of large supercooled drizzle/rain drops while it was holding which contributed
to the formation of a ridge of ice on the upper surface of the wing, aft of the wing
deice boots, in front of the ailerons. The crew received a clearance to descend to 8,000 feet. At 1557:23, as
they were descending at 185 KIAS, the CVR recorded the activation of the aural flap
overspeed warning. The flightcrew retracted the flaps in response to the

warning. The FDR data indicate that as the flaps retracted, the autopilot increased
the pitch attitude to maintain a preset vertical speed for the descent. As the airplane pitched nose up and the AOA increased through 5
degrees, the airflow in the area of the right aileron began to separate from the wing
upper surface because of the ice ridge. As the AOA continued to increase, the
airflow separation in the area of the right aileron also increased, causing a reversal of
the right aileron hinge moment characteristics. Although the right aileron hinge
moment reversal caused the ailerons to deflect rapidly to a right-wing-down (RWD)
position, the AOA was not sufficient to activate the stall warning system prior to the
aileron deflection. The autopilot could not control the aileron deflection rate, which
exceeded that allowed by the autopilot so the autopilot disconnected. Within 0.25 seconds of the autopilot disconnection, the ailerons fully
deflected to the RWD position79 and the airplane rolled rapidly to the right until
reaching 77 degrees RWD. An immediate nose-down elevator deflection reduced the
AOA; and the ailerons were deflected LWD by the flightcrew to counter the right
roll.</div>

flightcrew&#x27;s conversations with her contributed to the accident. However, a sterile cockpit environment would probably have reduced
flightcrew distractions and could have promoted an appropriate level of
flightcrew awareness for the conditions in which the airplane was
being operated.
37. The flightcrew’s failure to increase the propeller RPM to 86 percent
and activate the Level III ice protection system in response to the
1533:56 caution alert chime was not a factor in the accident.
38. Had ice accumulated on the wing leading edges so as to burden the ice
protection system, or if the crew had been able to observe the ridge of
ice building behind the deice boots or otherwise been provided a means
of determining that an unsafe condition was developing from holding
in those icing conditions, it is probable that the crew would have exited
the conditions.

209
39. The captain&#x27;s departure from the cockpit to use the rest room while the
airplane was in the holding pattern was neither prohibited by Federal
regulations nor inconsistent with Simmons Airlines/AMR Eagle
policies and procedures and did not contribute to the accident.
40. Although the Simmons Airlines/AMR Eagle policy does require
flightcrews to provide a PIREP of icing conditions, and it would have
been prudent for the crew of flight 4184 to provide such a report, their
failure to do so did not contribute to the accident.
41. Although the crew of flight 4184 received an aural traffic alert and
collision avoidance system (TCAS) alert shortly before the roll
excursion, this alert was not perceived by the crew as a conflict, and the
proximity of the two airplanes to one another did not contribute to the
accident.
42. Both pilots saw the ground, realized their close proximity and high
descent rate, and made a nose-up elevator input that, combined with the
high airspeed (about 115 KIAS over the certified maximum operating
airspeed) resulted in excessive wing loading and structural failure of
the outboard sections of the wings.
43. Although both crew members of flight 4184 were certified flight
instructors, this was probably the first time they had experienced such
unexpected and excessive roll and pitch attitudes in the ATR 72. If the
operators had been required to conduct unusual attitude training, the
knowledge from this training might have assisted the flightcrew in its
recovery efforts and might have prompted the captain to provide useful

any reports of hail in the area,

Hail, having generally a lesser reflectivity to radar than other
forms of moisture, coupled with misleading information presented by a
higher than normal a.tc1..a up-tilt, could have induced the crew to
continue to press for &amp; ceviation to the west. We do believe, however,
that the fact that the crew knew that another Braniff flight, coming
from the west, was deviating to the east parallel to the storm front,
taken in conjunction with the repeated comments from the controller
regarding deviations to the east, should have been sufficient reason
for the captain of Flight 352 to reconsider his decision to penetrate
the weather area,

ONE hog

After the penetration of the storm had been initiated, the
decision to reverse course was not in keeping with recomnended
company procedures for speration in areas of turbulence. Normally,
once in an area of turbulence, the crew is expected to maintain the
attitude of the aircraft as nearly straight and level as possible
and maneuvering is to be kept to a minimm until the turbulent area
is cleared. The possibility of gusts being added to control inputs,
and resulting in an upset, is a consideration that must be assumed by
the pliot. Because of certain apparent anomalies in the flight data recorder
readout, the Board analyzed the recorder readout in an attempt to
clarify the recorded data, These anomalies were apparent time reversals in the indicated heading and airspeed traces near the end of
the recording, They occurred during the short period of time following
the epparent upset and attempted recovery. During this period, the
aircraft was being subjected to violent and rapidly fluctuating accelerations. In addition, the heading and airspeed were changing very
rapidly due to aircraft maneuvering, and the heading trace was also
being affected by gimbal errors. Under these conditions, the advance
rate of the record mediwn can be very erratic and can even reverse in
direction momentarily. In addition, extremely rapid movement of the
styli can cause slight wrinkling of the aluminum foil. The aberrations,
in our opinion, invalidste the indicated advance or reversal of time
for this very brief period and also serve to confirm that the aircraft
was being subjected to extremely violent and rapidly fluctuating accelerations. There is nothing in this situation, however, to cause us
to doubt the validity of the magnitude of the recorded data points. The Board then analyzed the readout in an atteapt to define the
terminal maneuvers of the accident aircraft. This analysis indicated
that the aircraft commenced a 24° bank at 1647:10 and maintained this
bank for 10 seconds. During this 10-second period, a load factor of
1.1 &quot;g&quot; would have been required to maintained the 24° bank angle in
level flight. The centroid of the &quot;g&quot; trace peaks on the readout were
considered to be the average acceleration for the time period under
consideration and were determined to be 1.3 for the first 5 seconds
and 1.1 for the second 5 seconds.</div>

contact was lost. The captain of Braniff 352 told the copilot not to
talk to the air traffic controller too much because
they were &quot;trying&quot; to get the crew to admit they had
made a big mistake by going through the storm system. The captain of Braniff 352 ordered a reversal of course. The flight was immediately cleared by the controller
to make the course reversal turn in any direction,

The flight recorder traces were studied by three
separate groups. The consensus of the groups was that the aircraft was
upset subsequent to the initiation of a right turn to
reverse course. During the upset, NO7O7C rolled to the right to a bank
angle in exce :: of 90°.

NO7O07TC pitched nose dow to approximately 40°.

The heading information being fed to the flight recorder would be erroneous in steep bank angles due to
“gimbal errors,&quot;

The NASA studies indicate the maneuver which preceded
failure of the wing of N97O7C was well within the control and performance capabilities of the Electra aircraft. A rapid rate of descent is correlated with the observed
erroneous heading rates of change on the flight recorder
record from N97O7C.

~ ko -

A rapid increase in airspeed is correlated with the
high rate of descent and erroneous heading rates of
change,

As the rapid increase in airspeed ceases, an acceleration force increase begins and “peaks&quot; out at

4.35 &quot;ge&quot;,

fhe slope of the heading trace starts to flatten out
at 1647:26, indicating that a roll recovery maneuver
had been initiated. . :

Immediately following the initiat‘on of the right turn
for course reversal, &quot;g&quot; forces fluctuating between
{{0,2 and / 1.6 indicated the aircraft was encouitering

vertical gusts,

The initial structural failure was the compression
failure of the right wing upper planking at WS 101. This failure was the result of positive bending and
leading edge up torsional moments in excess of those
for which the aircraft was designed. No evidence of any significant pre-existing structuraL

damage was observed in the wreckage, and the nature of

4f a crack had precipitated the failure. No in-flight fire existed before the integrity of the
wing fuel tanks was disrupted by the breakup. The fuel
so released was ignited by some means, creating the ball
of fire observed by ground witnesses,

The lightning, which occurred at about the sane time
the ball of fire was observed according to ground
witnesses, was not a factor in this accident. A study of the flight recorder readout indicates that
the aircraft entered into first a lateral and then 4
longitudinal upset approximately 20 seconds before a
4.35 &quot;g&quot; peak was reached on the acceleration trace. At the time of this high maneuvering load factor, the
aircraft was in the process of recovering from the
spiral upset.

‘he recovery maneuver involved a left rolling pullout
from a dive. The failures of the outer right wing and empennage
were initieted by forces, accelerations or control
movements generated by the inboard wing failure. The left wing parts which separated came off during
the descending gyrations of the fuselage-left wing
contination. At the time of breakup, the flaps were retracted and,
during the breakup, the landing gear extended. The
right aileron was forced into the full-up position
when the aileron push-pull rod was pulled as the wing
separated. The breakup of N9707C occurred at an altitude of about
6,750 teet, 2,700 feet north and 800 feet east of the
initial impact point. Eyewitnesses did not observe the initiation or the turn
for the reversal of course of N9TO7C. None of the eyewitnesses observed N97O07C for the last
30 seconds prior to breakup. Eyewitnesses in the best position to have observed
NOT7O7G reported seeing it between clouds and then
disappearing into the storm,

These eyewitnesses support the air traffic controller
and Weather Bureau witnesses&#x27;s testimony that N9TO7C
entered the leading edge of the storn. Visual perception of the pilot might have been reduced
by a near lightning stroke. The reduction of visual perception or the startling
effect of a near lightning stroke should not have been
sufficient to cause over-control of the magnitude to
cause an upset by an experienced airline pilot.

(bo) Probable Cause

The Poard determines that the probable cause of this accident
was the stressing of the aircraft structure beyond its ultimate strength
during an attempted recovery from an unusual attitude induced by turbulence
associated with a thunderstorm. The operation in the turbulence resulted
from a decision to penetrate an area of known severe weather. 3. RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the Board&#x27;s findings of contaminated ‘hydraulic fluid and
corrosion of some of the hydrauiic components of the aircraft, the Board
recommended to the Pederal Aviation Administration that their Air Carrier
and General Aviation Inspectors be alerted to the necessity of constant
vigilance with respect to all operators’ procedures and practices in all
aspects of fluid handling. The Administrator concurred with this reconmendation and advised the Board that “our position is re-emphasized in
the text of a maintenance bulletin being processed for early issue to
Flight Standards field offices.&quot; This bulletin was publish:d August 30,

Aircraft Accident Report
Statements on the CVR recording indicated that the pilots did not fully understand
the aerodynamic and performance considerations associated with operations at an altitude
of 41,000 feet. Specifically, about 2154:07, the captain stated, “we’re losing here. We’re
gonna be … coming down in a second here.” About 3 seconds later, the captain stated,
“this thing ain’t gonna … hold altitude. Is it?” The first officer responded, “it can’t man. We … (cruised/greased) up here but it won’t stay.” About 2154:19, the captain stated,
“yeah that’s funny we got up here it won’t stay up here.”100
Pinnacle Airlines’ ground school upset training addressed high altitude
aerodynamics, swept-wing design characteristics, and the use of performance charts. Also,
the company’s ground school performance training provided pilots with instruction on
how to use climb capability charts to determine thrust settings for altitudes above
36,000 feet. The CVR recording did not indicate whether the flight crew consulted the
company’s altitude and climb ability charts before initiating the climb to 41,000 feet. However, the Safety Board concludes that the improper airspeed during the climb
demonstrated that the pilots did not understand how airspeed affects airplane performance
and did not realize the importance of conducting the climb according to the published
climb capability charts. Section 2.3.1 discusses high altitude training for regional jet
operations.
2.2.2 Aerodynamic Stall and Upset Event
Even though the pilots recognized that the airplane’s performance was
deteriorating, neither pilot appeared to respond to this situation with urgency. The pilots
contacted the controller about 2154:32 and requested a lower altitude; however, during the
time that the controller was coordinating the descent, the airplane’s airspeed further
deteriorated to Mach 0.53 (150 knots), and the stickshaker activated for the first of five
times. Afterward, the stickshaker activated four times, and the stickpusher activated four
times, pushing the control column forward automatically.101 The flight crew responded to
the stickpusher each time by pulling back on the control column. These control column
inputs caused the airplane’s pitch angle to increase to a maximum ANU value of 29º about
2154:59, and then the airplane entered an aerodynamic stall. Afterward, the airplane’s
pitch angle decreased to a maximum AND value of 32º about 2155:06. While the pitch
angle was decreasing, a left rolling motion began, which eventually reached 82º left wing
down, and the N1 and fuel flow indications for both engines declined steadily to zero,
indicating that both engines had flamed out.</div>

casual, and sounds of joking and laughing were heard during the recording. Also, the transcript showed that

Aircraft Accident Report
According to models of human error, the pilots’ performance during the climb and
their decision to operate at 41,000 feet can be described as “optimizing violations,” which
occur when someone disregards defined procedures intentionally to make a job more
interesting or engaging, to push limits, or to impress another.115 For example, the pilots’
CVR statements about operating at an altitude of 41,000 feet were consistent with
thrill-seeking behavior. It is not possible to determine the specific reasons that the pilots
demonstrated these optimizing violations. However, according to situational control
theory, the chance that someone will violate a rule increases when such a violation results
in personal achievement and is likely to go undetected.116 In this case, the Part 91
repositioning flight with no passengers or other crewmembers on board presented the
pilots with an opportunity to reach personal milestones associated with aggressive
maneuvering and operating the airplane at its maximum operating altitude. The Safety Board’s investigation of this accident did not reveal any evidence that
the pilots had previously engaged in the unprofessional behavior demonstrated during the
accident flight. Also, the CVR recording contained no indication that the pilots anticipated
the adverse outcome resulting from their intentional deviations from standard operating
procedures. Such intentional deviations can compromise the margins of safety that are in
place as a result of procedures established by the company, the manufacturer, and the
FAA. A consequence associated with compromising these margins of safety is that the
operator becomes more vulnerable to the catastrophic effects of unintentional errors.117 
Evidence indicated that the critical human performance failures during the flight
were the result of intentional behavior and were not consistent with typical errors (slips,
lapses, and mistakes) found in most flight crew-involved accidents involving Part 121
operators. Although the pilots demonstrated some performance failures and deficiencies
in basic airmanship that were consistent with the more typical errors found in accidents,
such as their failure to achieve required airspeeds during the descent (see section 2.2.3),
the pilots’ overall actions during the accident flight were not consistent with the degree of
discipline, maturity, and responsibility required of professional pilots. The Safety Board
concludes that the pilots’ unprofessional operation of the flight was intentional and causal
to this accident because the pilots’ actions led directly to the upset and their improper
reaction to the resulting in-flight emergency exacerbated the situation to the point that they
were unable to recover the airplane. The Safety Board is concerned about the willful misconduct demonstrated by the
pilots during the accident flight. The Board has investigated other recent accidents in
which pilots did not adhere to standard operating procedures and demonstrated a lack of
cockpit discipline.</div>

upset event, the flight control inputs made during the upset were opposite of what was
required to recover the airplane. FDR data showed that the flight crew moved the control
column aft after the first stickpusher activation and that the crew moved the control
column aft with increasing magnitude after the next three activations of the stickpusher. A reason that might explain why the pilots made these flight control inputs, which
exacerbated the upset event, was that Pinnacle Airlines’ stall recognition and recovery
simulator training focused on recovery with a minimum loss of altitude (which is common
throughout the aviation industry). As a result, the pilots were trained to apply power to
restore the energy state of the airplane and to maintain altitude.104 In this accident, the
pilots’ inputs could have been the result of their attempt to recover using a minimal
altitude loss recovery technique, and, as the repeated stall events occurred with increasing
nose-down pitch attitude, the pilots could have been instinctively trying to arrest the
102 The Safety Board compared the AOA recorded on the FDR at the time of the stickshaker activations
with Bombardier’s stickshaker design criteria for the flight condition and determined that the stickshaker
activated at the expected AOA (about 7.8º) and airspeed (about 150 knots).
103 In December 2004, the FAA sent a letter to Transport Canada that recommended, among other things,
that Bombardier change “the airspeed tape display software to more accurately depict the top of the Low
Speed Awareness (top of the red band) at all altitudes and Mach Numbers.” In February 2005, Bombardier
indicated that it would include an appropriate design change the next time the stall protection computer and
the air data computer were modified and that, in the interim, its FCOM would be revised to provide
necessary guidance material on changes to the computation required to determine the low speed cue. In
November 2006, Bombardier stated that it had not yet scheduled the modification; in December 2006,
Bombardier issued the revised FCOM.

nose-down pitch moment or responding inappropriately to the stickpusher. The Safety
Board concludes that the pilots’ lack of exposure to high altitude stall recovery techniques
contributed to their inappropriate flight control inputs during the upset event. Section 2.3.2
discusses stall recognition and recovery training.
2.2.3 Double Engine Failure
About 2155:06, the flight crew declared an emergency and asked the controller to
stand by. CVR evidence showed that the flight crew recognized the nature of the
emergency; specifically, about 2155:23, one pilot stated to the other, “we don’t have any
engines.” However, the CVR also showed that the flight crew did not begin the first item
of the double engine failure checklist (which is a memory item) until 1 minute 19 seconds

he failed to recognize the trainee’s severe disorientation, and atternpted to coach
the trainee through a recovery from an unusual attitude. In the process, the IP lost
awareness of the airplane’s altitude and rate of descent and may have become
spatially disoriented. As a consequence, the airplane entered an uncontrolled
descent and crashed into the ocean in less than 15 seconds. The spatial disorientation of the captain-trainee occurred in large part
because the IP exercised poor judgment in exposing the captain-trainee to a failure
of his attitude indicator followed by the simulated failure of the right engine while
the trainee was maneuvering the airplane at relatively low speeds and a low
altitude on a nonprecision instrument approach on a dark night. The disablement
of the trainee’s attitude indicator without a means of covering the indicator, despite
the trainee’s specific request, was in itself a significant hazard to the trainee’s
spatial orientation because it is difficult to completely ignore the instrument unless
it is covered. As a result, the false indications of airplane attitude as the speed of
the indicator’s operating gyro slowed would have tended to distract and confuse

the pilot. Also, the lapse of almost 6 minutes between disablement of the attitude
indicator and simulated failure of the right engine would have introduced
Significant errors in the indicator’s display of the airplane’s pitch and bank
attitudes. Since there was no mention on the CVR of covering the attitude
indicator, the Board believes that the IP used poor judgment in subjecting the
trainee to such conditions. Almost 6 minutes after disabling the trainee’s attitude indicator, the IP
compounded the trainee’s problems with spatial orientation by simulating the
failure of the right engine, which would have introduced significant lateral and
directional control problems. Failure of an attitude indicator in the BE 1900 did
not constitute an emergency as defined in the pilot’s operating handbook, because
of the airplane’s two independently-powered attitude indicators. Therefore, when
he simulated a failure of the right engine, the IP technically did not introduce
multiple emergencies. However, by not permitting control of the airplane by
reference to the IP’s operable attitude indicator, he effectively created multiple
emergencies for the captain-trainee, which again reflected poor judgment on the
part of the IP. Although it appears that none of the company’s operations specifications or
its operating policies and procedures were disregarded by the IP who was involved
in the accident, the Safety Board believes that considerable more attention and
communication from management was needed to assure adherence to standard
instructional methods and to flight safety. Instead, company management officials
relied on the judgment of the IPs. The evidence indicates that company management officials were not well
informed about the flight training activities within the company, at least with
respect to the BE 1900 airplane and Part 135 training. This probably occurred,
in part, because of the lack of a subordinate program manager for the BE 1900
airplane and the lack of an assistant chief pilot at the principal base.</div>

the airplane with his attitude indicator disabl’4d and uncovered,
followed about 6 minutes later by a simulated iailure of the right

control of the airplane (&quot;Your aircraft?&quot;)}}; instead, the IP attempted to
coach the captain-trainee inio a recovery from an unusual attitude. The attempted recovery from an unusual attitude was not successful,
apparently because the IP lost awareness of the airplane&#x27;s altitude and

altitude too low for recovery.

The airplane probably crashed into the ocean in a near-inverted
attitude with the outboard section of the left wing striking the water
first and with the longitudinal axis at a substantial angle with respect
to the surface of the ocean. Company management personnel did not adequately supervise the BE
1900 flight training program to ensure that training objectives were
met without exposing its pilots to conditions potentially hazardous to
flight safety. The FAA failed to adequately monitor the company’s flight training
programs and faiied to recognize that management&#x27;s oversight of and
involvement in the BE 1900 training program were minimal. 10. PROBABLE CAUSE

The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable
causes of this accident were the instructor pilot’s loss of altitude awareness and
possible spatial disorientation, which resulted in the loss of control of the airpiane
at an altitude too low for recovery; and company management’s lack of
involvement in and oversight of its Beechcraft 1900 flight training program. Contributing to the accident was the instructor pilot’s exercise of poor judgment
in éstavlishing a flight situation and airplane configuration conducive to spatial
disorientation that afforded the pilots little or no margin for error. 11. SAFETY RECOMMENDATIONS

As the resutt of the investigation of this accident, the National
Transportation Safety Board recommends that the Federal Aviation Administration:

Require principal operations inspectors of commuter
airlines to verify that appropriate and qualified levels of
airline management are actively involved in the airline’s
flight training programs. (Class II, Priority Action)
(A-93-70)

29

Encourage commuter airline managers to use approved
flight simulators for pilot training, qualiftcation, and
competency and instrument check purposes to the
maximum extent feasible. (Class II, Priority Action)
(A-93-71)

Consider an amendment to 14 CFR Part 135 to require
that commuter air carriers perform certain hazardous
training, testing, and checking maneuvers, such as
engine-out operations and recovery from unusual flight
attitudes, in approved flight simulators to the maximum
extent feasible. (Class IH, Longer Term Action)
(A-93-72)

The Safety Board also recommends that the Regional Airline Association:
Encourage its members to use approved flight simulators
for required pilot training, qualification, and competency ©
and instrument check purposes to the maximum extent
feasible. (Class II, Priority Action) (A-93-73)

The pilots of N811BE were qualified in the airplane in accordance with
FARs and company policies. Although neither autopsies nor post mortem
toxicological tests could be performed because the bodies of the pilots were not
recovered, there was no independent evidence of medical or physiological
problems that might have adversely affected their performance. Further, the CVR
conversations between the pilots suggest that neither had any physical problems
that might have affected their control of the airplane. The Safety Board concludes that there is no evidence to indicate that the
airplane was not airworthy or that structural failures, or systems defects or
malfunctions, precipitated control difficulties. All critical structural failures
observed were caused by overloads associated with forceful impact with the
surface of the ocean. Although the evidence was not conclusive with regard to when the outboard
section of the right wing separated from the airplane, the Safety Board believes
that the wing was intact when the airplane crashed into the ocean. The
postaccident drift analysis placed the wing section in the wreckage area when the

20

accident occurred. Metallurgical examination disclosed that there were no defects
in the structural components of the wing in the area of separation and_ that
separation occurred from overstress. Based on the airptane’s last transponder-reported position and altitude, the
airplane performance study disclosed that the airplane could have descended to the
wreckage location within the 15 seconds that elapsed between the last altitude alert
recorded on the CVR and the end of the recording. Further, the descent could
have occurred without exceeding performance limitations in terms of airspeed and
acceleration loads that could have caused major structural failures. Moreover, the
descent could have occurred without acceleration loads that would have made intra
cockpit conversation difficult--as noted before, the pilots’ conversation was not
abnormal throughout the descent and the IP continued to discuss unusual attitude
recovery actions with the captain-irainee almost until the end of the recording. The Safety Board cannot conclusively exclude the possibility of an event that
caused premature termination of CVR operation before the airplane struck the
water because the CVR events could not be precisely coordinated with the position
and altitude as recorded by ATC radar, nor was there any FDR information
available to establish the airplane’s actual performance during its final descent. However, throughout the approximate 32-minute CVR transcript there was no
mention by any of the pilots of any airplane systems problems, engine problems,
or instrument problems, other than those created by the IP. Therefore, considering
all of the evidence, the Board believes that any event that would have caused
termination of the CVR must have been sudden and probably catastrophic, which
leads to the conclusion that the event was a high speed coilision with the surface
of the ocean.</div>

The Safety Board considared the possibility that a failure of
the electrical systew had caused the unset. The aircraft had experienced
previous electrici&#x27;) problems. If the electrical systui; had failed,
flight manual pro: -dures for such an anomaly, if properly followed,
would not have allowed the power interruption to last long enough to
destroy flight guidence information. The flight cperatione manual
contained procedures to handle generator failures, geuerstor overheat,
out-of-balance generatur cutput, bus bar failure, (inverter fatlure,
abnormal voltage, or voltage fluctuation. Further, the aircraft was
equipped with an emergency electrical source to power instrument panel
lights. Pilot training records showed that both crewmembers had demoustreted
satisfactory proficiency in electrical system operation after they had
received additional training. Additional evidence that a total and prolonged electrical
systen failure did not occur includes: (1) Witnesses saw lights operating
on the aircraft; (2) the physical characteristic of light bulb filanent
failure at impect; and (3) the receipt of transponder signals during the
descent from 9,300 ft. However, the Safety Board cannot dismiss the
possibility that an electrical failure did occur and caused the flipghtcrew
to become distracted to the extent that control was lost before the:
electrical fault could be corrected. The Safety Board also examined the possibility that th. upset
was caused hy a loss of attitude reference information. The conflict
between the pilot&#x27;s and copilot&#x27;s attitude indicators indicated a need

for further investigation, since the difference between the two instruments
could be attributed to a failure or malfunction in one of the instruments
before the aircraft broke uv. The only abnormalities found during the
examination of either attitude system were the busned orushes in the
vertical gyro which provided cttitude information to the pilot&#x27;s aDI

and the discrepancy between his ADI and its controlling vertical gryo. This lends support to a theory that an attitude system failure occurred. As previously mentioned, review of the flight shows clearly that «he

pilot was experiencing difficulty in complying with the controller&#x27;s
instructions. The conflict in the information found on the pilot&#x27;s anc
copilot’s attitude indicators fndicates that they ceased nomial ope ation
at different times. Despite the fact that the breakup and power interruption should have occurred simultanesusly to both instruments, the
pilot&#x27;s flight director displayed a 4° nosedown, 7° right wing down,
upright attitude, and the copilot&#x27;s attitude indicator displayed a
30° noseup, 10° left wing down inverted attitude. Since the copilot&#x27;s
indicator is a self-contained unit and can function correctly for a few
min after removal of electrical power, the Safety Board believes that it
correctly indicates the aircraft&#x27;s inverted impact attitude.</div>

existed; however, the crew might have suspected that one existed
ani turned off the switch of the failed generator as a corrective
measure. This action would have removed 115 v.a.c. power from the
FDS. On the other hand, if one generator were inoperative and the
other became overloaded and cut off, it is conceivable that the
crew might have lost control of the aircraft while attempting to

restore power. A loss of control is evidenced by the fact that the aircraft,

‘10. The crew was properly certificated zor the flight
involved

The aircraft was properly certificated. The weight and balance and center of gravity of
the aircraft were within limitations at departure
from LaGuardia and at the time of the accident. Weather conditions near the accident site were
IFR with layered clouds up to 18,000 feet and
little or no visible horizon above that altitude. There was no fire in flight nor on the ground. There was no structural failure during the flight
other than the loss of landing gear doors. There was no malfunction or failure of the flight
control systen. There was no evidence of crew incapacitation although

-no post-mortem examinations were conducted. The left a.c. generator malfui ctioned or became inoperative in flight. Electrical power was not convinuously supplied to the
pilot&#x27;s (captain&#x27;s) essential flight instruments,
particularly the Flight Director System. This could
have been acconplished by: ,

a. either leaving the left generotor switch on,
thus allowing the right generator to assume
the load;

b. or, if the left generator switch is turned off,
turning on the static inverter switch. At the time of the &amp;.c. electrical power loss, the aircraft was in 4 20° right bank. —

The aircraft impacted the ground with the engines at
idle power, the speed brakes extended, and the landing
gear partially extended,

The aircraft turned right approximately 280° and
descended from approximately 18,000 feet above
the ground in the Last minute of flight, as
evidenced from the position of the landing gear
doors 2.4 miles northwest of the crash site.</div>

damage. The gas generator drive train seizure was caused by physical interference to gas generator 
accessory gear train rotation by the thermally distorted gearbox casing.45 The power turbine drive

Examination of the wreckage and analysis of the accident site location did not reveal any 
evidence of a preimpact hydraulic failure or anomaly. The caution light warning panel was 
removed from the wreckage for further examination. An analysis of the filaments for the light 
bulb corresponding to the hydraulic system failure light revealed that the filaments were not 
stretched, indicating that they were not illuminated at impact. Careful examination of all the 
light bulbs for systems other than the pitot heat revealed that no filaments exhibited stretch, 
further indicating that no system failures had occurred. Both of the pitot heat bulbs exhibited 
minor stretch, indicating that the advisory light for the pitot heat system was illuminated at the 
time of ground impact. The investigation revealed that none of the in-flight emergencies relating to the failure of 
the hydraulic system would have required the pilot to immediately execute an emergency landing 
in sloping hazardous terrain with a prevailing tailwind. Most anomalies and emergencies of the 
hydraulic control system result in stiff controls requiring a high degree of effort by the pilot to 
effect movement. Most hydraulics-off emergencies are terminated by the pilot executing a 
running landing47 into a suitable flat area with the actual touchdown being performed at or above 
translational lift speed48 (normally 15 to 20 knots). Several suitable areas, including an airstrip, 
were available to the pilot for such a landing within 8 nautical miles (about 5 minutes flying 
time) of the accident site. As previously mentioned, the investigation revealed that the engine was operating at 
considerable power at impact Other witness marks and evidentiary findings indicate that the 
pilot’s antitorque pedals were in the full-right position (consistent with counteracting the fulltorque effects of a running engine, at low-forward airspeed, and with the rotor blades at 
maximum climb or lift pitch), and the collective lever was in the full-up position (pilot 
commanding the rotor blades into the maximum lift configuration). Ground scar evidence at the 
initial impact point clearly establishes that the helicopter was not rotating or spinning and, thus, 
was under positive pilot directional control.</div>

2.4.2 Flight Control Systems
From the FDR data, it is apparent that the airplane&#x27;s departure from controlled
flight began with a sudden heading change to the right. A lateral or directional flight
control problem could produce such a maneuver whereas a longitudinal control system
malfunction would produce a pitching maneuver evident by a sudden change in the
airplane&#x27;s load factor. A pitch change was not evident in the FDR data. There were no anomalies found in the longitudinal flight control components that
were available for examination. The elevators were recovered at the accident site and the
horizontal stabilizer was trimmed in a normal range. During the attempted recovery from
the upset, the airplane&#x27;s load factor increased to about 4 G--a maneuver that would have
required a pilot-commanded elevator deflection. The Safety Board thus concludes that the
elevator control system was functional until impact. The lateral control system consists of ailerons and flight spoilers controllable by
the captain&#x27;s and first officer&#x27;s control wheels. The aileron power control units provided
evidence that the ailerons were at or near neutral at impact. There were no anomalies
noted in the actuators that could account for an uncommanded movement. Although there
was some conflicting evidence regarding flight spoiler position, all of the damage was
consistent with impact-applied loads. The aileron spring cartridge, which is installed to
permit independent operation of the left or right ailerons in the event that the opposite side
of the aileron system becomes jammed, was bent and extended. This damage also was
readily explainable by impact loading and is not viewed by the Safety Board as evidence
of an in-flight problem. Thus, there was no evidence that a lateral control system
malfunction occurred in flight. There is also no evidence that a ground spoiler deployed to cause the lateral upset. The condition of the ground spoiler control valve slide was consistent with a retracted
spoiler position. Further, had either the flight or ground spoilers been extended in flight,
the airplane would not have been able to achieve a 4-G load factor at 212 KIAS without
activating the stall warning stick shaker. The sound of the stick shaker was not heard on
the CVR.</div>

pumps remained powered throughout the flight. With both the A and B hydraulic systems operating, it can be assumed that, absent
some other unidentified failure, there was sufficient control capability to cope with any
combination of engine thrust variations. Thus, while the Safety Board cannot rule out the
possibility of engine surges or a momentary asymmetric thrust condition, the Board
concludes that these factors, if they did occur, should not have resulted in the loss of
control evident in this accident. Analysis

Structures
All of the airplane&#x27;s flight control structure was found and examined, except for a
portion of the rudder and vertical stabilizer. The wreckage was localized, and there was no
wreckage found along the flightpath. The portion of rudder and vertical stabilizer not
examined consisted of composite material located in the middle of the surfaces. Fragments of charred composite fabric were found with the extremities of the surfaces
indicating that they were present at impact and burned during the postcrash fire. Reconstruction of the wing structure indicated that all of the parts were attached
until impact. Examination of fractures of the wings indicate that the failure modes were
consistent with impact overload failures. Examination of the wing flaps showed that the
flaps were attached to the wing structure and there were no mechanical failures prior to
impact with the terrain. The positions of all of the flap jack screws indicated that there was
not a split flap condition and the flaps were at the 10-degree position at impact. This
position was further confirmed by metallurgical analysis of the detent track from the flap
handle module. Examination of the ailerons indicated that they were attached to the wings
until impact. The continuity of the flight control cables throughout the wings indicated
that the aileron cables did not malfunction in the wing areas. The attach points for the
spoilers indicated that they were attached to the wing structure until impact. Crushing of
the leading edge devices (slats) in the extended position indicated that all of the slats were
properly extended at impact. Reconstruction of the empennage revealed that all parts were attached to the
structure until impact. The recovery of the rudder top cap and the balance weights at the
crash site indicated that the rudder was present and intact at impact. The recovery of the
elevator end balance weights and the elevator hinges at the crash site indicated that the
elevators were present and intact at impact. Examination of the elevator control
mechanisms indicated that there was no elevator malfunction prior to impact. Examination of the horizontal stabilizer indicated that there was no preimpact malfunction
or failure of the horizontal stabilizer. Numerous examinations of the wreckage failed to produce evidence of preimpact
structural problems. Engine mount separation points showed evidence of impact overload. All doors were closed and latched. The Safety Board considered the possibility that the “mist” trailing the wing
observed by witnesses was produced by fuel or hydraulic fluid resulting from a structural
failure of some nature.</div>

Systems
From the flightcrew conversations recorded on the CVR and the flightpath
described by FDR data, it is evident that the loss of control occurred suddenly and that the Analysis

Aircraft Accident Report
crew were not aware of any prior problems with the airplane&#x27;s systems. However, the
lateral upset and the flightpath of the airplane during the final 9 seconds of flight could
have resulted from a flight control system malfunction. Thus, the Safety Board&#x27;s
investigation focused on an examination of the wreckage and all recovered components of
the airplane&#x27;s hydraulic and flight control systems in an effort to identify any anomalies
that could have produced the loss of control. The onset of the loss of control occurred nearly 30 seconds after the flaps were
extended to 30 degrees. The trailing edge flaps and leading edge devices would have
began extending immediately and would have reached the command position before the
first officer&#x27;s comment, “we&#x27;re at a thousand feet,” which was made in a tone of voice that
did not express unusual alarm. Thus, the Safety Board concludes that the flap operation
was symmetrical and normal.
2.4.1 Hydraulic Power
The primary flight controls of the B-737 are powered by the independent A and B
hydraulic systems previously discussed in section 2.2. A loss of fluid or pressure from
either of these systems would result in a loss or degradation of some flight control
functions. However, the Safety Board found no indications that the systems had
malfunctioned, except for a stretched bulb filament in the HYD indicating light on the
first officer&#x27;s annunciator panel. Because several other light bulb filaments were stretched,
some of which would normally illuminate only in a press-to-test check, the Board does
not view this evidence as meaningful. The evidence also shows that the motor-operated shutoff valves in both the system
A and System B flight control modules were open and that the motor-operated shutoff
valves in the standby hydraulic system module were off or closed. Because impact loads
do not usually affect the position of motor-operated valves, it is assumed that the systems
were operated in this normal configuration before impact. Had the flightcrew been aware
of an A or B hydraulic system problem, it would be expected that they would have talked
about it and perhaps selected the standby system. Thus, the Safety Board believes that the
A and B systems were pressurized and capable of delivering hydraulic power to the flight
controls. The teardown examination of the hydraulic components showed considerable
evidence of contamination in the A, B, and standby systems.</div>

utter. The separation of the horizontal stabilizer was caused by an abnormal
asym metrical afr load on the stabilizer. Structural failure was preceded by some other failure or malfunction of
the airplane&#x27;s elevator control system. The aft fracture of the left elevator control rod was due to compression
buekling at or near the midpoint. The aft fracture of the left elevator control rud occurred before the
elevator separated from the stabilizer. The elevator control rod failed in compression buckling with an applied
load of about 466 pounds. The elevator control rod would fracture at its midpoint when the load is

applied through the rod end bearings, as ii would be applied in the norma]
‘light through pilot input. A combination of commanded aircraft hose up pitch attitude and nose
down trim tab deflection results in compression forces in both the left

and the right control rods, with the force in the left rod being the
greatest. The control column pull force required to cause a compression fallure of
the left elevator control rod would approach or exceed the maximum

two-hand pull force of about 20% pounds, which can be applied by one
male pilot of average strength. The trim tab actuator Indicated full trailing edge up trim tab deflection
(airplane nose down).

The separation of the elevator tips from the elevators and the elevators
from the stabilizer occurred during or immediately after the horizontal
Stabilizer attachment failed and as a result of inertial and aerodynamic

loads which were imposed on the stabilizer and elevator assembly during
its separation from the fuselage. The left elevator trim tab requires about 30 seconds to travel from an
approximately neutral takeoff trim position to the full trailing edge up
position.</div>

also possible that the pilots&#x27; pull forces might have caused the control system to seize or
jam again, so that the available pitching moment was limited to the extent that the
airplane&#x27;s descending flightpath could not be corrected, The pilots might then have pulled
back on the control yoke to their maximum capability in an attempt to prevent impact

There was no tangible evidence from the examination of the wreckage of a
seized or jammed control system, nor have there been any known occurrences of such
problems in the EMB~-110P1 and P2 sevice history. However, there have been some SDRs
in which stainless steel elevator cables have become worn where they pass through
fairlead blocks near the midsection of the forward-to-aft cable run, an event which can
lead to seizure of a cable within a fairlead block. The identification of this problem
prompted the manufacturer to issue a service bulletin that recommended the replacement
of stainless stee] elevator control cables with harder carbon steel cables, which are more
resistent to wear. The aft cables were replaced on N96PB in February 1983, and the
cables were inspected In Jctober 1984, with no defects noted. Notwithstanding these
maintenance actions, it is possible that a worn cable seized within a fairiead block during
the takeoff rotation, particularly since problems have been reported with the carbon steel
cables. Also, &amp; control system jarn could have been caused by a foreign object interfering
with a cable pulley or by a control coluiun, or by a seized right elevator hinge bearing. Any of these conditions could have resulted in an elevator control system seizure or jam
which could have been relieved only by high control system forces or by a momentary
reversal of the force applied to the control yoke. In summary, the Safety Board believes that a control system seizure or jam,
followed by the foregoing sequence of events would expiain this accident and probably is
more easily understood that a runaway trim occurrence, because the pilots should have
been able to control a runaway trim by applying the required pull force on the control
wheel to prevent loss of control even though they might not have been able to
immediately diagnose the nature of the emergency. Further, it is not Ukely that the I
pilots could have taken actions to prevent the accident if the control system had seized or
jammed, The inability of the Safety Board to determine conclusively the initial event
which resulted in the full trailing edge up deflection of the elevator trim tab precluded
the Board from citing either runway trim or a jammed control as causal.</div>

was intact until the stabilizer separated. A similar conclusion regarding the left control
“0d could not be made because that control rod was fractured in two places with a 9-inch
intervening section missing. The aft failure of the left control rod was typical of compression buckling and
was initially attributed to impact forces applied when the rod struck the ground and was
foreed into the earth, However, after determining that differential elevator deflection
could explain the horizo ward attachment separation, the left control rod
fracture and the fuse : examined more closely for evidence that the left
elevator control rod fractured during flight. The examination disclosed that two facts
Supported an In-flight fracture: (1) the compression buckling fracture occurred at or very
near to the exact midpoint of the control rod (a failure which would be typical of a
control system compression induced fracture); and (2) there was an impact mark on the
aft side of an upper channel at fuselage bulkhead No. 35 which matehed the shape of the
fracture surface of the aft position of the left control rod. This impact mark indicated
that the rod fractured and the aft portion of the rod had struck the chunnel before tie
elevator separated from the stabilizer. Consequentiy, the Safety Board concludes that
the left elevator control rod failed as a result of compression overstress during flight;
that this failure, in conjunction with abnormal trim tab deflection, permitted clifferential
deflection of the left and right elevators; and that the resultant asymmetrical loads
caused the horizontal stabilizer separation.

2.11 Control System Overload

A load is applied to the elevator control rods whenever a pilot applies a force
to either of the control columns to maneuver the airplane in pitch. The load applied under
normal conditions is reacted to by the aerodynamic loads on the elevators which are
dependent upon the elevator deflection, elevator trim tab position, aud airspeed,

The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of the accident was an unwanted oxtension of the ground and
flight spoilers, which resulted in a loss of control at an altitude from
which recovery could not be made. The ground spoilers probably deployed
because of a hot electrical short {{n the spoiler extend circuitry, Whereas the spoilers probably deployed symnatrically, the left ground spoiler
actuator fatled in flight and caused a loss of lateral control. The sudsequent loss of pitch cuntrol was caused by the full nosedcwn elevator
trim tab position and the high airceaft speed.

3, RECOMMENDATIONS

On August 14, 1974, the Safety Board submitted Safety Recommendation
A~-74=61 to the Administrator, Federal Aviation Administration. A copy of
tha recommendation and the FAA&#x27;s response is contained in App .ndix E. The Grumman American Aviation Corporation has forwarded proposed
changes in the Jongitudinal trim and ground spoiler systems to the Federal
Aviation Administration for approval, The FAA has approved a change to
the longitudinal trim system which has been published as Aircraft Service
Change 186. The FAA has also issued a Notice of Proposed Rule Making in
the Federal Register (Volume 40, Nuirber 41, Page 8568, dated February 28,
1975) to require mandatory compliance with Aircraft Service Change No,
186, Another modification of the longitudinal system replacoment of the

- 16 =
single element trim switch with a double element switch is being prepared
for FAA consideration. A proposal to change the flight power shutoff system is being prepared and completion is expected by Grumman by September 1975, Upon com&gt;
pletion, this proposal will be forwarded to the FAA for approval. BY THE NATIONAL Th NSPORTATION SAFBTY BOARD

speed and the spoilers must be extended to a large angle, Largs agymmetric spoiler extensions, with their Strong rolling inputs, cannot be cons
trolled at high speed in either the powered or manual modes of flight
contrcl, In order to regain roll control under these circumstancas, the
aircraft would have to be decelerated substantially, To regain speed
brake synmetry, if the aireraft wes in the powered mode, the pilot could
revert to thea manual mode to blow the speed brake down or he could extend
the speec brakus through use of the cockpit control,

It is possible that excessive nosedown trim was inadvertently
applied during the attemted recovery from the rolls. It is also possible
that one or both of the pilots were injured or disabled through the rolls
and not able to assist in regaining control of the aircraft. 2.2 Conclusions

(3) Findings

i, The only evidence of an aircraft malfunction was the
extended position of the ground spotler panels at impact,

The elevator trim tab position waz full nosedown to the
electrical trim stop. The aileron manual trim wae sec
9.5° left wing down,

The landing gear and the wing flaps were retracted at
impact. The right and left ground spoilers were unlocked and exe
tended in flight. Their exact position could not be deter~
mined, The inboard and outboard flight svoLlers on each
wing were extended betwaen 24° and 55°, and 24° and 35°,
respectively,

The left ground spoiler panel actuator was fractured,
probably by high afrloads,

The cause of tha unwanted ground spotler extension was
probably a hot electrical short which bypassed the four
ground spoiler interlecks installed in the syetem,

The extension of the ground spoilers caused the flight
Spoilers to extend,

e 1 «

This unwantes extension of the spoilers occurred at a
relatively low airspeed and when the aircraft was ina
landing apprcach configuration,

The unwanted extension of the epollers resulted in an upset
and a rapid less of altitude. The pilots provably attempted recovery from this upset by
retracting the guar and flaps, increasing pewer, and ace
celerating the airplane to a speed of mre than 300 kn,

The resulting high airloads failed the actuator rod of
the left ground spoiler whch resulted in lateral asymmetry
and high rolling moments.</div>

effect will be reduced to almost zero or slightly nosedowm. As long as
the engines operate and there is sufficient altitude, the aircraft can be
accelerated co an aicspeed that will allow a pilot to maintain level
flight. Under some conditions, there would be an excess of thrust, and
the aircraft could climb to higher altitudes with all the spoiler panels
extended,

Deployment of the ground spoilers in flight at low speeds with the
landing gear and wing flaps extended could cause a temporary loss of contiol., Normal reflexive action in such an occurrence would be to increase
power, retract the gear and flaps, accelerate the aircraft, and attempt
to obtain straight and level flight, The pilot could not know that the
ground spoilers had been deploved, but would probably deduce from his
previous experience that the flight snoflers ware extended, He might,
under these circumstances, attempt to retrect the spoiler panels by
cycling the flight spoiler control handle in the cockpit or by activatir:
the flight power shutoff valve. Nefther of these actions would heve had
any effect on the extended ground spoile:s. Turning off the flight control power with the flight spoilers extended could have caused an unwanted
rolling condition, which may havc prompted the pilot to restore flight
control power and to extend the flight spoilers asymmetrically. If
hydraulic pressure were removed while the flight spoiler panels were exe
tended, thay would probably blow dowa at different rates because of the
different internal leakage rates in the actuators, ‘This situation has
caused unwanted rolls in the past. Effective lateral control could be
regained immediately by reactivating the hydraulic control system, Ale
ternately, any roll input caused by asymmetric flight spoiler deflection
would stop when all the panels returned to the faired position, even
with the hydraulic flight control system inoperativa,

based on the destruction of the aircraft, the ‘afety Board has esti-~
mated thet the aircraft velocity at impact was in e‘cess of 300 kn. Tha
velocity required to fail the spoiler actuator wae calculated to be above
300 kn, i.‘tneasses!&#x27; observations of the aircraft suggest that the aircraft
was proces “2g essentially level below tha clouds when the consecutive
rolls began, Although deactivation of the flight control power system
with the flight spoilers extended could have resulted in a transtent roll

input, the consecutive rolls observed were ist likely caused by fatlure
of the ground spoiler actuator or hydraulic line and the consequent ree
traction of ali the spoiler penels on the left wing of the atreraft,

This condition would have caused the atreraft to roll rapidly to the
right.</div>

FAA regulations and approved procedures. The original airplane certification process had
required demonstration of relevant handling qualities of the airplane, including conditions
normally encountered in the event of sudden loss of thrust of either engine. The results of
this investigation did not reveal any handling characteristics of the DC-9-14 which were
inconsistent with the original standards for certification of the airplane. For example,
the pilots who participated in the Safety Board&#x27;s DC-9-14 flight demonstration deseribed
the airplane&#x27;s handling characteristics as docile, even after the sudden and complete loss
of thrust from the right engine in a simulated takeoff/climb phase of flight. Consequently, the Safety Board concludes that the loss of control of the airplane was not
directly attributable to the loss of thrust from the right engine. The analysis of this accident thus examined those factors which, in conjunction
with, the failure of the airplane’s right engine, might have caused the pilots to lose
control. Those factors included:

° The possibility that fragments of the right engine separated with
sufficient energy and trajectory to cause critical damage to the
airpiane’s flight control system;

~47T-

° The possibility of control system malfenction(s) which, in
combination with a single or dual power loss, could have rendered
the airplane uncontrollable;

° The possibility of a mechanical failure of the left engine, either
related or unrelated to the failure of the right engine, which left

the airpiane with insufficient thrust to maintain flight; and

fe) The possibility of inappropriate flighterew response to the
emergeney presented by the failure of the right engine. To resolve the factors which precipitated the loss of control, it was first
necessary to examine the circumstances of the failure of the right engine.

2.2 ight ine Failure and Demage from Uneontained ine Parts

The physical damage to the engine and the condition of the inlet fan biades
and low pressure compressor blades indicated that the right engine had little or no
rotation at impact with the ground. The sound spectrum examination of the CVRrecorded engine sounds also indicated that this engine lost rom very rapidiy after the
engine failure. The hole in the high pressure compressor in the plane of rotation of the 9-10
Stage removable sleeve spacer and the damage to the compressor and spacer revealed
conclusively that the spacer had ruptured in flight and that the spacer parts were not
eontained by “he engine easing. The ejected spacer parts had ruptured the rear skirt
intermediate .ase at the 11 to 1 o&#x27;clock position, leaving a 4-by 7-inch opening in the top
of the case. The loss of the spacer and consequential Camage within the right engine
caused a rapid deceleration and a complete loss of thrust from that engine.</div>

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] Also, it was found that the
rudder hydraulic actuator, which controls rudder movement by hydraulic pressure or by
transferring control input to the aerodynamic tab, showed no evidence of preimpact
damage. Additionally, the rudder power shutoff vaive was found with a bent control rod
and discoloration, consistent with rudder hydraulic power on at ground impact. The Safety Board also examined the possibility that the right engine cowl was
biown open in flight or became distorted to such an extent that excessive drag was
produced, affecting controllability of the aircraft. Aithough the right engine upper
eowling was extensively damaged by impact forces, all four outboard iatches remained
latched. There was no evidence to indicate that the right cowl had opened in flight. A
recovered right cowl pieces which could be positively identified were found within the
impact area. Although a small (2- by 2-inch) piece of metal whieh resembled cowl
material was found near runway 19R, it was determined that each square foot of
deformed cowling would produce drag equivalent to a reduction of engine thrust by 160
pounds--a minor factor. Based upon the small hole (4- by 77-inch) found in the right engine
case, the absence of other case deformation (other than impact damages), and the
characteristics of typical uncontained engine pieces ejected at high velocity, the Safety
Board concludes that the cowling deformation probably was small and therefore caused
very little additional drag following the right engine failure.

2.3 Flight Control System Failure or Malfunction

The Safety Board considered the possibility of a flight control system failure
or malfunction, unrelated to the right engine failure, that might have occurred
simultaneously or nearly simultaneously with the right engine failure, and thet
subsequently led to the loss of control. The Safety Board does not believe that such a
failure or malfunction ceeurred for several reasons, ineluding those reasons cited
previously regarding possible damage caused by the ri¢ht engine failure. In addition, an
analysis of the contro! movements, which woukl have been required (commanded or
etherwise) for the airplane to have maneuvered as indicated by the FDR, revealed that:

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] The Safety Bogrd also considered the possibility that the captain&#x27;s left rudder
pedal support arm fractured after he deflected the left rudder pedal. Even though the
fracture mode of the pilot&#x27;s pedals cowld not be determined conclusively from
metallurgical examination, there was no evidence that a pedal failed during a critical
phase of flight. Review of CYR sounds revealed no noise or flighterew response that
could be associated with such en event. The similarity of the fractures on both the
captain&#x27;s and copilot&#x27;s pedals suggests that they were subjected to similar forces at
failure, most probably overstress at impact. Furthermore, failures of rudder pedals in
past incidents oceurred during braking actions while on the ground, rather than during inflight operation because rudder control forces applied in flight produce less stress on the
pedals. Finally, failure of the left rudder pedal would result in return of the rudder to a
near-neutral position, and would not account for the deflection of the rudder to the right. Therefore, the Safety Board concludes that the rudder pedal support arm fractures were
eaused by overstress forces at impact and were not related to the cause of the accident. In conclusion, the Safety Board determined, after examination of the
wreckage, trajectory study calculations, and research into the DC-9-14 control system,
that engine parts probably did not strike the aircraft after being ejected fram the right
engine. The Board believes that if any of the smali engine parts actuallv struck the
aircraft, no damage of any consequence would have oecurred as a result of that contact. Tne Board found that there was no basis upon which to conelude that flight control
systems malfunctioned or were damaged in flight, secondary ts the right engine failure,
and that ali of the onboard flight control systems on NIOQOME were available to the
fligntcrew following the abrupt loss of right engine power. Further, electrical power was available to the crew of flight 105 until impact
based upon the continuous operation of the FDR and the CYR and the elongation of the
right wingtip navigation light buib filament, which indicated that the filament was hot
and, therefore, on when subjected to impact forces.

2.4 Left ine Power Loss

The Safety Board does not believe that the left engine power loss was
signifieant with respect to the eventual loss of control of the airplane. Any reduction in
left engine thrust that occurred before stickshaker would have reduced the yawing of the
airplane which occurred after the right engine failure. While possibly necessitating a
foreed landing. a left engine power ioss should not have precipitated, or even contributed

to, a loss of control of the airplane. However, the reduction in ieft engine power could
have confused the crew.</div>

Manual (GMM) contained adequate procedures for

_ Maintenance and quality control. There was a lack of compliance with the GMM procedures by
the mechanics, inspectors, and supervisors responsible for
ensuring the airworthiness of N33701 the night before the I

engine separated early in the breakup sequence when the left wing failed. The -
failure of the left wing released fuel that probably led to the in-flight fire. The passenger seat that was ejected from the cabin at ground impact
suggests that the fire did not progress into the cabin area before impact. This I
conclusion is supported by the absence of soot deposits in the respiratory tract of
the occupants, and the absence of elevated carboxyhemoglobin in the tissues of the
occupants.

. The FDR data and examination of the wreckage revealed that the
flight control systems, engines, and propellers were operating normally before the
extreme attitude changes of the airplane. Consequently, engine and propeller
malfunctions were not a factor in the accident. .

The Safety Board&#x27;s analysis of this accident included an examination
of the circumstances that led to the loss of the left stabilizer leading edge,
including: flightcrew performance related to the accident; the maintenance and
inspection conducted by Continental Express the night before the accident; the
management of the Continental Express maintenance department; the FAA

34

approval and oversight of the Continental Express maintenance program; and the
procedures for establishing RIIs by the aircraft manufacturer, the airline, and the
FAA. The Safety Board’ s analysis also examined the aerodynamic and .
structural failure aspects related to the dynamics of the airplane after it lost the left
stabilizer leading edge.

2.2 Aerodynamic and Structural Failure Aspects

The Safety Board believes that the airplane experienced the following
sequence of events during the final moments of flight. The airplane was
descending at 260 KIAS, which was well within its operating envelope, the wings
were level, both engines were operating normally, and the pitch attitude was
10 degrees nose down. As the airplane descended through 11,500 feet, the leading
edge of the left horizontal stabilizer separated from the airframe. The left
horizontal stabilizer leading edge was the first piece of wreckage found along the
wreckage path, preceding the next piece by almost 1/2 mile. This indicates that it
_ was the first piece to separate from the airplane. The loss of the leading edge
exposed the front spar of the left side of the horizontal stabilizer to the airstream,
and an aerodynamic stall occurred that greatly reduced the downforce produced by
the horizontal stabilizer. The reduction in downforce created a large nose-down
pitching moment, and the airplane pitched down immediately. A peak load factor
of approximately -5 g was reached at the end of only 1 second. The airframe remained intact (minus the leading edge), and the load
factor fluctuated around -2 g, for approximately 6 1/2 seconds. The. airplane pitch
attitude decreased to 68 degrees nose down, airplane heading moved 20 degrees
nose left, and a 15 degree right roll attitude was reached at the end of this period. The airplane&#x27;s altitude was 9,500 feet, and it was flying at an airspeed of
280 KIAS.</div>

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] The 2 flight crewmembers,
1 cabin crewmember and 11 passengers aboard the airplane were fatally injured. The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the
probable cause of this accident was the failure of Continental Express maintenance
and inspection personnel to adhere to proper maintenance and quality assurance
procedures for the airplane&#x27;s horizontal stabilizer deice boots that led to the sudden
in-flight loss of the partially secured left horizontal stabilizer leading edge and the
immediate severe nose-down pitchover and breakup of the airplane. Contributing
to the cause of the accident was the failure of the Continental Express management
to ensure compliance with the approved maintenance procedures, and the failure of
FAA surveillance to detect and verify compliance with approved procedures.

- The issues in this investigation focused on:

1. The responsibilities of the Federal Aviation Administration
and aircraft manufacturers and operators to determine the
critical items and inspection levels of aircraft systems.

2. The procedures for relaying and standardizing maintenance
shift turnover information. As a result of this investigation, the Safety Board issued safety
recommendations to the Federal Aviation Administration on the feasibility of
developing a means to advise flightcrews of recent maintenance work on aircraft
and the need for reviewing regulations, policies and practices for establishing
required inspection items with a view toward developing more specific
identification of such items. Also, as a result of this investigation, on February 28,
1992, the Safety Board issued safety recommendations to the Federal Aviation
Administration that would enhance both flight standards surveillance of
Continental Express and flight standards Program Guidelines, including the
National Aviation Safety Inspection Program. I

further tail load changes inthe aircraft nosedown direction. Because of
the low gradient, the increase in contro! column force could have been
negligible. Although the captain could have relieved the contro! pressures
by use of the stabilizer trim, it is likely that he preferred to hold some
push force on the column, In this case the forward control column
pressure may have been relatively low and not indicative of the degree to
which the aircraft was out-of-trim,

After the accident, it was determined that a burned contact in the
stabilizer trim control relay would cause a 25-percent reduction in the
operating speed of the trim motor. The Safety Board believes that the
discrepancy would have had little effect onthe captain&#x27;s ability to tcim
out control loads and thus was not a factor in the accident, In addition,
the higher-than-allowable clevator hinge line friction would have had
little effect except to further mask the abnormal control forces. In any event, with the aircraft out-of-trim and the low control
column force gradient, even a slight relaxation of prassure on the
column would cause an abrupt pitchup. The captain and the first
officer reacted naturally to such a pitchup Ly applying more push
force to the control column, Again, because of the low force required,
the tendency was to overcorrect, Subsequent control cotumn motions
aggravated the oscillation, The crew propurly reduced power and
allowed the aircraft to slow. As the airspeed decreased the aircraft
response became less sensitive to control inputs and the oscillations
ceased.

Although tha stick free stability of the aircraft was probably not
impaired, the out-of-trim condition would preclude the relaxation of

control column force, ‘lhe best procedure would have beer to hold the
control column in a fixed position and allow the aircraft to stabilise,

In view of the acceleration loads being experienced, this procedure may
have been difficult to apply, I

Since the aircraft experienced g forces alternating from positive to
negative, the aircraft occupants were thrown to the ceiling and then back

tothe floor. Ifthe occupatts fell to the floor when the aircraft floor wa -

rising, the force of impact would have been great. Probably this type of

force and movement caus ed the serious injuries, Two passengers said
that although they were able to grab onto something with thetr hands,

descent from cruise altitude and consisted of about
55 cycles with maximum peak to peak vertical
acceleration loads at the aircraft&#x27;s C.g. of +2.4g to

There was no evidence of turbulence in the area of the
accident. The crewmembers were properly certificated, trained,
and qualified for the flight. :

The aircraft was certificated, equipped, and maintained
according to regulations, I

A waviness of tha upper skin on the left stabilizer disrupted the boundary layer onthe surface. The thickened
boundary layer was further disturbed by a step down in
the stabilizer-to-elevator contour fair produced by the
elevator hinge alinement, The resulting pressure diatribution on the elevator affected the longitudinal cont~ol
loads,

Critically weak push forces were required to displace the
control column and produce elevator trailing edge down
deflections which were necessary to counter aircraft
noseup, ont-of-trim conditions. The aircraft wae out-of-(rim when the autopilot was
‘disengaged. The light control forces masked the out-of.
trim condition,

The light control forces induced the flightcrew to overcorrect in response to aircy aft pitching motions and
initiate and sustain the longitudinal oscillation. The crew reacted properly by reducing power and slowing the aircraft. I

The &quot;fasten seatbelt&quot; sign was off before the porpoising
began, I

Unrestrained persons in their seats and those standing in
the aft cabin area were the most severly injured,

The injured occupants were repeatedly thrown from floor

sharp cornere, and protruding surfaces, (b) Probable Cause

‘The National Transportation Safety Board dstarmines that the
probable cause of this accident was a combination of design tolerances
in the aircraft&#x27;s longitudinal control system which, under certain conditions, produced a critical relationship between control! forces and

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS AND CONCLUSIONS &gt; ANALYSIS] The investigation has uncovered no evidence of longitudinal instability that would have presented a problem to the crew. Other carriers
have reported pitch problems and porpoising of the aircraft in flight,
but the B-99 has not demonstrated any instability that could be considered
dangerous. Types of control malfunction which could produce a pitchover would
be related to either the longitudinal trim system or to the primary
longitudinal control system. Of the two, the trim system is the more
eritical, since that system is capable of producing greater pitching
moments than the elevators. The FAA flight-test programs indicated that the longitudinal control
forces generated by the stabilizer were excessive and, as a result, the
nosedown trim capability of the aircraft was restricted to 3.5°. This
rrogram also reported that while stick forces generated by changes in
engine power, by themselves, weré acceptable, power changes made in
- conjunction with upsets due to turbulence, inadvertent flap operation,
or improper stabilizer position couid induce additive control forces
which could become uncontrollable. Inadvertent operation of the landing
flaps could result in high stick forces and could be confused with unscheduled stabilizer trim motion. User experience with the aircraft has
shown that unscheduled trim actuator motion can be induced by sticking
secondary trim system switches. The fault analysis of the horizontal stabilizer actuator prepared
by the manufacturer for the certification of the B-99 indicated that no
single fault in the actuator system could cause a failure of that system.

~ 27 -

The fact that a sticking secondary trim actuator switch could cause

the system to impose unwanted trim motion in the aircraft is considered
by the Board to be a failure of the system. Beyond that, however, the
fault analysis did not relate the actuator trim system to the performance
of the aircraft or the crew. It was also noted that the analysis was
not used to the maximum to train flightcrews in the operation of the aireraft. For example, the analysis indicated that if the pilots opposed
one another on the primary trim system, the system would stop. Actually
this condition would result in an opening of the trim system circuit
breaker and deactivation of the trim system. This possibility was not
brought to the attention of flightcrews before the Air South accident
occurred. Such an analysis was incomplete unless it was integrated with the
aerodynamic characteristics of the aircraft in which the actuator was
to be installed. Consideration of human response rates, recovery factors
in time, and variables such as c.g., airspeed, etc., should have been
inclujed in the report. When used as a basis of proof that the pitch
system met the requirements of certification, the analysis lacked several
critical elements that should have been included. The ramifications of possible faults of the trim system could
only have been evaluated in the performance of the aircraft. Then
corrective action could have been placed in effect on the aircraft, which
would have eliminated some of the problems that arose when the system was
evaluated ina flight test environment. Items such as the trim-intransit warning device might have been deemed necessary from the beginning.</div>

evidence of any medical condition that would have
incapacitated the crew. The wings separated from the aircraft in a negative
direction, symmetrically, and simultaneously. The mode
of failure indicates the application of a symmetrical.
negative load to both wings. All the flight control surfaces were found in the primary
wreckage area. There was no evidence of any structural
failure prior to the wing failure. There was no evidence
recovered of any malfunction or failure of the flight
control system. The record of this investigation does not support a
finding of longitudinal instability within the aircraft
operating envelope. The secondary longitudinal trim system had a history of
sticking switches that could induce unwanted pitch trim
changes. The primary trim system had no such history. The fault analysis of the primary trim system actuator
did not forecast the results of opposing primary trin
applications or sticking secondary trim actuator switches. The fault analysis of the trim actuator did not relate
‘the actuator to its operating envirorment, the aircraft,
or the flightcrew.

fhe horizontal stabilizer had the capability of producing
greater pitching moments than could the elevator. Flight tests and simulator tests have shown that excessive
stick forces can be generated by out-of-trim conditions
that result in higher-than-normal airspeeds. These stick
forces can exceed the capability of one pilot, and in

some cases two pilots, to control. The simulator tests indicated that it was possible to put

the the aircraft in a flight condition where the combined

pull capability of the pilots would not te sufficient ‘o
effect a recovery. At the time of the accident, published information was
not available to flightcrews regarding certain undesirable
design features of the longitudinal trim systen. Studies indicate that angular accelerations in any
plane of less than 2°/sec® may not be perceived by
piiots without supplementary visual cues. The angular acceleration in the vertical plane,

generated by a runaway or sticking secondary trim switch
condition, would be of less than 2°/sec* for several
seconds. Unprogrammed primary trim changes in the same
plane could go undetected for 1 to 2 seconds, particularly
if the initial motion was masked by light to moderate
turbulence.</div>

broken by the horizontal stabilizer, also fractured below that point

war tensile failure at a point where the cross-sectional area of the
stringer was approximately 1 square inch. For 7175 aluminum in this
state, a force of 80 to 100 kips would have been required to cause the
tensile failure. If the stringer had been broken above this point,

Both eilerons overtraveled upward. The left aileron overtravel
is believed to have oocurreé @uring the gyrations which resulted efter
the right wing separated, since the outboard hinges were driven so rer
into the wing trailing edge. The right aileron overtravel was fairly
a, uniform and not nearly as extensive as that of the left. Thie over-

travel appears to be consistent with that which the aileron push-pull
rod might be able to cause if the rod were loaded to its structural
limtt in tension. We believe the rod was loaded to its structural
limit in tension after the initial wing failure at WS 101. No evidence was found to indicate that any in-flight fire existed
. before the wing failed. Except for the empennage area, the smaller
Se pieces of structure which separated in flight were generally unburned
. and unscoted. The only indications of in-flight fire were the soot
patterns on the right horizontal stabilizer and the heat damage on tne _
trailing edge and flap sections of the main piece of the right wing.

poe Me fact that the initisl failure cecurred in the right wing is
clearly established by the soot and fuel wash patterns on the horizontal
stabilizer. Phe stabilizer had to be in place after the integrity of
the fuel tanks was disrupted. However, a review of the wreckage scatter
pattern indicates that both the right wing failures and the empennage
failures occurred very close together in time, since parts from both
areas were found together along the eastern edge of the scatter pattern.

“4 While it was established that the initial failure occurred in the

ne . right wing, it was not as clear whether the failure began inboard or

. outboard of the engines. The nature of the rear beam damage at the
outboard fracture indicates that both an upward aileron deflection and
the previously mentioned hydraulicking of the fuel in the No. 4 tank
were present at the time of the breakup, Both of these conditions can
be explained if the inboard failure occurred first. The pull on the
aileron push-pull rod as the wing separated would result in an upward
overtravel of the right aileron.</div>

moments applied to the WS 380 rib could cause failure of first the rib
and then the rear beam itself. The first failure in this area was
probably the separation of the upper chord from the top plank. However,
this same Loading does not appear to have been responsible for the outboard fracture where the rear beam failed primarily in tension at WS 516. The fracture between the chord and the upper planks progressed inboard
from WS 515 to 448. The nature of this failure and its location seem
more suggestive of an overpressure, probably caused by fuel hydraulicking,
than of eileron overloading. This belief is further supported by the
oily soot or dirt streaks left on the right aileron by fuel flowing over
tts surface. These streaks were roughly chordwise ani were more pronounced on the inboard end and the upper surface of the aileron. The right horizontal stabilizer failed in positive bending -- &amp;
direction opposite to that in which it is usually loaded, particularly
in a positive high angle of attack condition. The sooting seen on the
exterior and interior surfaces and on the fracture surfaces of the outer
part of the stabilizer indicates clearly that this was a secondary
failure. The stabilizer was also washed by unburned fuel. This must
have occurred when the stebilizer was intact, since the flow was aligned
with the normal airflow over the surface. It is evident that the stabilizer was engulfed in burning fuel which was ignited sometime after
the wing fuel tanks ruptured. The enount of soot inside the outer
section leads us to conclude that raw fuel was ingested by the fractured
end of the stabilizer and this fuel burned as the part fell, The source
of the loading which failed this surface was probably inertial forces
generated by the rapid roll of the aircraft immediately following wing
separation, Another source of loading which may have contributed to
the failure was an up airload caused by the loss of downwash, normally
generated by the wing, after the wing had separated. The left stabilizer did not fail but separated intact, taking its
fuselage attach structure with it. ‘The source of loading in this case
was probably the asymaetric tail load on the fuselage which resulted
after the separation of the right stabilizer. The vertical stabilizer, which separated to the left, also appears
to have failed as a result of inertial loads. This stabilizer was
struck by the leading edge of the right horizontal stabilizer, leaving
red paint marks on the leading cdge of the horizontal stabilizer from
the lettering on the vertical stabilizer. Although the damage caused by

-~ uy.

this strike was extensive, it did not cause the failure of the vertical stabilizer. The right-hand attach stringer at PS 1185, which was
broken by the horizontal stabilizer, also fractured below that point
in the plane of the vertical stabilizer failure. This lower fracture
war tensile failure at a point where the cross-sectional area of the

persists even though the CVR would not have contained any contemporaneous information

probable that the 25 minutes or more of recording which preceded the landing at Detroit
could have provided clues about causal factors and might have served to refresh the
flighterew&#x27;s memories about the whole matter. 3. CONCLUSIONS Findings

1. The flighterew was properly certificated and was qualified for the flight;
the captain had requalified in the B-727 only recently, had flown 21
hours 50 minutes since requalifying, had not flown for about 3 months
before requalification, and had flown exclusively as a first officer on B747&#x27;s from November 1977 to December 1978. The aircraft was certificated and maintained in accordance with existing
regulations and procedures,

The inboard slat track T-bolt on the No. 7 leading edge slat had failed
predominantly in fatigue.

the right outboard aileron actuator hinge fitting bolt rib had failed
predominantly in fatigue. The wear pattern on the slat alignment hooks indicated that the No. 7
leading edge slat was not aligned properly. There was no other evidence of irregularity, malfunction, or failure of
the aircraft&#x27;s flight control, autopilot, hydraulic, or flep systems that
might have caused or contributed to 4 lateral control problem. The aircrait&#x27;s gross weight and center of gravity were within the
authorized performance and maneuvering envelopes when a lateral
control problem develuped. The aircraft was cruising at 0.816 mach in level flight and smooth air at
39,000 feet when a lateral control problem developed. A failure of the right outboard aileron actuator hinge fitting bolt before
development of the lateral control problem would have permitted the
aileron to float ucward about 1 inch; this condition would have required
about 13° of left \leflection of the control wheel to maintain wings-level
flight and would have been noticeable. A right roli and a lateral control problem were caused by isolation of the
No. 7 leading edge slat in the extended position. There was no evidence of any combination of failures or malfunctions in
the aircraft&#x27;s flight control system that would have caused an
unscheduled extension of the No. 7 leading edge slat. The Neos, 2, 3, 6, and 7 leading edge slats were scheduled to the extended
position, and the Nos. 2, 3, and 6 slats were retracted as a consequence
of the flightcrew&#x27;s actions. When scheduled to re-ract, the No. 7 leading edge slat failed to retract
probably because tensile forces created by air loads combined with
friction and side forces on the piston rod, caused by preexisting
miscasignmen* of the slat, exceeded the available hydraulic retraction
force.</div>

The airline&#x27;s maintenance procedures involving the trim
system in the aircraft was deficient and flightcrew
training did not emphasize the hazard of a

mistrimmed stabilizer on takeoff. The FAA&#x27;s certification and surveillance of the airline&#x27;s maintenance procedures were tneffective and,

as a result, did not insure that maintenance personnel had sufficient knowledge of the trim system
and were capable of maintaining it in an airworthy
condition, end certification and surveillance

of flightcrew training in the aircraft were deficient
because they did not emphasize the potential problems,
other than runaway trim, induced through a mistrimmed
stabilizer. 3.2 Probable Cause

The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the
probable cause of the accident was the failure or inability of the
flightcrew to prevent a rapid pitchup and stall by exerting sufficient
push force on the control wheel. The pitchup was induced by the
combination of a ristrimmed horizontal stabilizer and a center of gravity
near the aircraft&#x27;s aft limit. The mistrimmed condition resulted from
discrepancies in the aircraft&#x27;s trim system and the flightcrew&#x27;s probable
preoccupation with making a timely Jeparture. Additionally, a malfunctioning
stabilizer trim actuator detracted from the flightcrew&#x27;s efforts to prevent
the stall. Contributing to the accident were inadequate flightcrew training,
inadequate trim warning system check procedures, inadequate maintenance
procedures, and ineffective FAA surveillance.

4, “RECOMMENDATIONS

As a result of this accident, on August 11, 1978, the Safety
Board recommended that the Federal Aviation Administration:

&quot;Tssue an Airworthiness Directive applicable to all Beech 99,

99A, A99, AIQA, and B99 model aircreft to require: an immediate
one-time inspection of the horizontal stabilizer trim system

to ascertain that all components of the system and its associated
position-indicating and —-warning wircuits are operational

within specified tolerances. (Class 1, Urgent Action)

actuator to stall or actuate at a slower-than-normal rate wher che
stabilizer was subjected to airloads during pitchup. The clutch would
have slipped in both main and standby modes of operation. ‘Thus, the
pilot&#x27;s ability to retrim the airplane would have been affected adversely. Maintenance personnel did not properly diagnose the deficiency
in tie actuator clutch mechanism, and, again, the flightcrew would not
have been aware of the deficiency, because the reported discrepancies
had not been recorded in the deferred maintenance portion of the daily
flight log and the stabilizer could have operated normally during ground
checks. Therefore, the Safety Board concludes that in view of the
nature of the mechanical discrepancies, the aircraft was not airworthy. FAA Surveillance

The Safety Board believes that the FAA had not effectively
performed its regulatory functions related to aircraft ani pilot
certification. The team of experts’ report attempted to describe the
potential longitudinal control problem with the Beech 99. The team had
recomnended that the control forces be reduced by aircraft modification
r, that a letter of competency be required for each pilot:-in-command.
‘ae Safety Board did not find during its flight tests that the control
forces expertenced in a takeoff with full noseup trim were substantially
reduced by the mdifications made by the Beech Aircraft Corporation. The Safety Board agrees with the team&#x27;s alternative--that a
letter of competency be required. The letter would certify that the
pilot is knowledgeable of those flight conditions judged to be most
detrimental to the sufe operation of the aircraft and had demonstrated
his skill in controlling the aircraft under those conditions. However,
the manner in which this certification was to be achteved was deficient,
because the instructions in FAA Order 8430.1A, paragreph 153, were
gen?ral and did not state how the flights were to be conducted. Also,
it did not clearly state the problem that may be encountered with a
mistrimmed stabilizer on takeoff, and this information was not listed in
the Aircraft Flight Manual. The tests conducted by the special investigation team were
conducted with the aircraft&#x27;s c.g. near the forward limit rather than
the aft limit. Consequently, the low control forces of 20 to 25 lbs of
push force identified might have influenced the team of experts’ conclusions
and recommendations. Therefore, the FAA evidently concluded that the
condition was not potentially dangerous and thit the aircraft was equipped
with features that would prevent unsafe operation. Therefore, only runaway pitch trim emergency training was emphas ‘22d. The FAA evaluated, but did not adequately document, the problem
of a takeoff with extreme noseup trim at aft c.g. Additionally, the FAA
did not implement the letter-of-competency recommendation associated
with the test evaluations and did not insure that its inspector was
aware of this problem in the Beech 99. Also, the principal operations
inspector had not been trained in either the Beech 99 or aircraft of
similar type.</div>

Federal regulations and approved procedures. There is no evidence that mechanical
malfunctions or failures of the airplane structures, flight control systems, or powerplants
contributed to the accident. The evidence indicates that the airplane’s hydraulic system was not configured for
landing. Because the hydraulic system remained in the low pressure mode, hydraulic pressure
was not available to lower the landing gear and deploy the flaps. The flightcrew failed to detect
this configuration error and continued its approach into Houston. Comments on the CVR and
postaccident statements by the flightcrew indicate that both pilots recognized that the flaps did
not deploy after the flaps were selected to 15o, but the flightcrew did not determine the cause of
this problem or execute a go-around. The landing checklist was not performed, and the flightcrew did not confirm that
the gear was down and locked. The gear warning horn sounded during the approach, indicating
that the landing gear was not extended, but it was ignored. When the airplane descended through
500 feet AFE, it was traveling 84 knots faster than the target airspeed of 132 knots. Although,
under COA standard operating procedures, this excessive airspeed mandated that the approach be
discontinued, the captain rejected a go-around request from the first officer, who was the flying
pilot. The GPWS sounded an alert 19 seconds before impact and was ignored. Unaware that the
gear was not down, the captain assumed control of the airplane and made a wheels-up landing. This analysis addresses flightcrew performance, including the role of fatigue in
the flightcrew’s performance, the adequacy of COA’s oversight of its pilots and the FAA’s
oversight of COA, checklist design, and survival factors.

2.2
Flightcrew Performance
Performance deficiencies exhibited by the flightcrew during this flight include: (1)
failure to configure the hydraulic system for landing during the performance of the in-range
checklist; (2) failure to detect initially that the flaps did not extend; (3) failure to determine the
reason the flaps did not extend after detection; (4) failure to perform the landing checklist and to
confirm the landing gear status; and (5) failure to discontinue the approach.
2.2.1
Failure to Properly Complete the In-range Checklist
Fifteen minutes before landing, as the airplane descended through 19,000 feet, the
captain omitted one item on the in-range checklist. The omitted item, “Hydraulics - ON &amp; HI,
CHECKED,” would have enabled the high pressure configuration of the hydraulic system,
thereby providing pressure to operate the flaps and landing gear. Three steps were required to
complete this checklist item: movement of the AUX and ALT pump switches from “OFF” to
“ON,” movement of the left and right engine-driven hydraulic pump switches from “LOW” to
“HI,” and confirmation that system pressures were between 2,800 and 3,100 psi.</div>

Findings
1. The two-member flightcrew and three flight attendants were trained and
qualified to conduct the flight in accordance with Federal regulations. There was no evidence of
any medical condition that might have affected the flightcrew’s performance.
2. The air traffic control request to maintain 190 knots to the outer marker did not
contribute to the accident because it did not affect crew actions, decisionmaking, or situational
awareness.
3. The airplane was certificated and equipped and maintained in accordance with
Federal regulations and approved procedures. There is no evidence that mechanical malfunctions
or failures of the airplane structures, flight control systems, or powerplants contributed to the
accident.
4. Because the captain omitted the “Hydraulics” item on the in-range checklist
and the first officer failed to detect the error, hydraulic pressure was not available to lower the
landing gear and deploy the flaps.
5. The “Hydraulics” item is placed too low on the in-range checklist, rendering it
vulnerable to omission.
6. The captain’s distraction from his duties as pilot-in-command and his disregard
for the sterile cockpit rule contributed to the pilots’ failure to detect their hydraulic system
configuration error when they selected 5o of flaps.
7. Both the captain and the first officer recognized that the flaps had not extended
after the flaps were selected to 15o.
8. The pilots’ lack of previous exposure, either through training or during line
operations, to the consequences of improper hydraulic system configuration contributed to their
failure to detect their hydraulic system configuration error.
9. The pilots failed to perform the landing checklist and to detect the numerous
cues alerting them to the status of the landing gear because of their focus on coping with the flap
extension problem and the high level of workload as a result of the rapid sequence of events in
the final minute of the flight.
10. Had the landing checklist been properly performed, the flightcrew would have
detected the failure of the landing gear to extend.

56
11. Although the first officer was unwilling to overtly challenge the captain’s
decision to continue the approach, he did attempt to communicate his concern about the
excessive speed of the approach to the captain.
12. There was no compelling reason for the captain’s decision to land the
airplane; multiple signals and guidance indicated that the approach should be discontinued, as did
Continental Airlines’ standard operating procedures.
13. The flightcrew’s degraded performance is consistent with the effects of
fatigue, but there is insufficient information to determine the extent to which it contributed to the
accident.
14. There were deficiencies in Continental Airlines’ (COA) oversight of its pilots
and the principal operations inspector’s oversight of COA.</div>

hydraulic system, this crew detected a problem with flap deployment when the airplane did not
respond with pitch and speed changes as flaps were selected to 15o and beyond. However, this

hydraulic system configuration. Neither the captain nor the first officer recalled events concerning

possess firsthand knowledge to help recognize that the symptom he was experiencing was the
result of this error. In addition, the Safety Board’s review of the information provided by COA to its
pilots concerning the DC-9 hydraulic system revealed that the flight manual and training
materials do not explicitly state that if the pumps are not switched to “HI,” the landing gear will
not extend and the flaps will not deploy. The Safety Board concludes that the pilots’ lack of
previous exposure, either through training or during line operations, to the consequences of
improper hydraulic system configuration contributed to their failure to detect their hydraulic
system configuration error. The Safety Board believes that the FAA should require all POIs of 14 CFR Part
121 operators using DC-9 and MD-80 airplanes with the “HI, LOW, OFF” hydraulic switch
configuration to ensure that operating manuals and training programs include information about
the consequences of improper hydraulic system configuration, specifically that the flaps and
landing gear will not function normally if the engine-driven hydraulic pumps are not set to “HI.”
2.2.4
Failure to Perform Landing Checklist and Confirm Gear Position
In accordance with company procedures, the first officer called for the landing
checklist after the gear-down call. Although he placed the gear handle in the down position, the
captain never initiated the checklist. Because the flaps remained stowed, the airplane did not slow during the approach. Traveling at a speed of approximately 200 knots, the airplane covered the distance between the
outer marker and the runway threshold in about 75 seconds. If the target approach speed of 132
knots had been maintained, it would have taken about 115 seconds to cover this distance. The
increase in speed allowed the flightcrew very little time to address the flap problem and
configure the airplane for landing. In the 27 seconds that elapsed from the time the captain said “I think the flaps *”
to the time the first officer stated “I don’t have flaps,” the captain manipulated the throttles and
then responded to the gear-down call, the flaps 25 call, the flaps 40 call, and the flaps 50 call. The captain had very little time to react to the directives he was being given by the first officer.</div>

flight-hours before the failure of the tail rotor blade. The fatigue crac.. in the spar developed over a period significantly
longer than 2 hours. The fatigue crack in the skin of the tail rotor blade was probably
present when the blade wa: inspected 45 min, before the accident. However, the crack could nat be ~_*tected readily. The visuai inspection procedures in effect were not adequate to detect
the fatigue crack in the skin which developed from a fatigue crack in
the spar. The loss of the 35-in. section of the ta:l rotor blade did not cause a loss
of directional control. The loss of the 35-in. section of the tail rotor blade generated
unbalanced forces, which caused three of the four tail rotor gearbox
housing attachment flanges to break from static overload and a portion
of a thread of the bolt in fourth fiange to fail.

The failure of the ettachiment flanges permitted the gearbox and
assemby to separate from the tail pylon, which caused the loss of
directional control and an abrupt nosedown pitch attitude change. The helicopter&#x27;s low altitude when directional control was lost and the
nosedown pitch change made further contrel of the helicopter
impossible. The flightcrew&#x27;s decision to attempt an emergency landing at Newark
International Airport was an appropriate decision under tte

number of fatalities and serious in!:-cies.

20. Fewer serious injuries would have occurred if the passengers had taken
a &quot;brace&quot; position. 3.2 Probable Cause

The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause
of this accident was the separation of the tail rotor assemb:y and gearbox from the
aircraft at an altitude which made further controlled flight impossible. The rotor
assembly and gearbox seperated because of severe vibrations in the rotor assembly
which were induced by the loss of a tail rotor blade due to fatigue failure. Contributing to the severity of the passengers’ injuries were the seat feilures
wriech occurred when the deceleration forces exceeded the relatively low design
strength of the FAA-approved seats, and the lack of guidance on a passenger brace
position for emergency landings.</div>

Flighterew Decisionmaking

The flightcrew was certificated properly und was qualified for the flight. They hed received the off-duty time required by regulation, and there was no
evidence thet medical or physiclogieal factors might have affected their
performances,

When the tail rotor failed, Flight 972 was at an altitude of about 1,400 ft, ana
1 mile east of the airport over the congested Port Newark area. The crew
recognized inmediately that the tai rotcr system had malfunctioned. As a result,
they had two opt.ons- - either to return to the airport or to autorotate. They
chose to atternpt an emergency landing ut the airport for several reasons; (1) The
airport, which was the only suitable fcrced-landing srea, was iess than a mile
away. (2) Once the appropriate emergency checklist had been accomplished and
the helicopter had been slowed to between 60 and 70 kns, the ere’. was able to
control the helicopter in spite of the severe vibrations. (3) There: was no yaw to
indicate a drive shaft malfunction and resultant loss of tail rotor rpm, (4) They
knew that if autorotation was initiated the rotor rpm would increase to about 105
to 108 percent, which would place a greater load on the tail rotor system. (5) The

firs\ officer believed tha, the additional rpm would have increased the vibration
and .aused complete luss of control of ine helicopter. (6) There was no suitable
landing «cea below them. Autcrotation may have resulted in an earlier landinz, but it may also have
caused the gearbox to separate sooner because of increased rotor rpm&#x27;s and
increased stress on the gearbox mouniing flanges. Also, it probably would have
resulted in a landing in a hazardous area of Port Newark. ‘fherefore, becuse
extended flight was not neressary, the helicopter was not yawing: significantly, and
the flichterew had no reason to believe
fail in the short ;eriod of time needed ‘to reach the ‘airport, the Safety Roard
concludes that the flighterew&#x27;s decision to niake a controlled emergeney landing at
autorutational speed was an appropriate decision

directly to the fuselage walls and flooring, causing localized flexion of the walls
end distortion of the floor. As a result, the passengers in the furward cabin were
probably thrown when the sidewall tiedown structure failed. The Safety Board is aware that similar inadequacies in design requirements
for passenger seats for general av-stion aircraft e.ust, Therefore, improvements in
general ay.ation aircraft crashworthiness have been made a special safety
objective. We expect to include improvements in design requirements for
helicopter passenger sets in this objective. Four ctcupants reported taking a brace position before the initial impact. These ce.upants receive? less severe upper torso and head injuries than other
occupants seated in the same rows who did not assume a orace position. For
example. one passenger whe was in the brace postioi received only minima! injuries
although both cecupants seated beside him were killed. Another passenger, a
former U.S. Army helicopcer crewman, assumed a brace position and received only
minimal tad and upper torse injuries while the passenger next to him received a
serious open, depressed fronta! skull fracture. The emergency procedures and the pessenger briefing cards should have
specifically required the flight attendant to instruet passengers to assume the
standard brace position, which would have red.ced tue possibility of serious injuries

during the emergency landing.

The flighterew was certificated properly and qualified for the flight. The aircraft was certificated, maintained, and dispatched in accordance
with Federal Aviation Regulstions and approved maintenance
procedures. The black tail rotor blade broke when the helicopter was at 1,200 ft and
abeut 1 mile east. of the airport. The blade broke because it had been weakener Sy &amp; preexisting fatigue
erack in the leading edge spar and the blade skin about 35 in. from the
tip of the blude. The facigue crack had propagated through 90 percent of the leading
edge spar and through less than 2 in. of the skin covering the spar. The spar fatigue origin was located at the outboard corner radius of the
aft face of the leading edge spar. The area where ‘he fatigue originated in the spar was covered by the
aluminum envelupe, which made it impossible to detect during a visual
inspection. The fatigue crack began in the spar before it started in the skin. The fatig e crack in the skin developed over a period of at least 2
flight-hours before the failure of the tail rotor blade. The fatigue crac.. in the spar developed over a period significantly
longer than 2 hours. The fatigue crack in the skin of the tail rotor blade was probably
present when the blade wa: inspected 45 min, before the accident. However, the crack could nat be ~_*tected readily.</div>

touchdown when the voice record began to show a sense of
{{mpending emergency in the tone cf voice and the comments
made ky the crew. Based upon the preceding evidence, the Board concludes
that the initial touchdown was not of a destructively hard
nature. The next possibility explored was that some
malfunction of $$the aircraft caused this accident. Malfunctions which might possibly have been involved include
loss of thrust, control system malfunction, landing gear
malfunction, and pilot seat failure. The first two

malfunctions may be dismissed summarily since the crew did
not report any problens in these areas and since no evidence
of such malfunctions was observed in the Board&#x27;s examination
of the wreckage or of the flight recorder data. The possibility that a malfunction of the right main
landing geax (RMLG) caused this accident precipitated an
extensive study of that system. This study produced no
evieence that any preimpact malfunction existed in the
landing gear or its attach structures; rather, it
demonstrated that the parts examined were sound, and that
all fractures were caused by overloczrds applied to the RMLG. The pxobable failuice sequence advanced by the Boeing
Company seems reasonable to the Board. The second
touchdown, which was described as the hardest of the three,
overstressed the year attach structure and the failure was
jnitiated at that time. Passengers, it should be noted,
described grinding sounds, and some thought that something
on the RMLG broke at that time. The aircraft then
apparently became airborne, after the FS 940 frame began to
separate from the fuselage skin, but before the separation
was complete. The pieces of fasteners reportedly found
about 2,000 feet down the runway are consistent with this
theory. The third touchdown then completed the failure of
the gear attach structure. . This final disruption of its
attach structure then allowed the landing gear to
displaced upward until the right wing tip and the trailing
edge of the outer wing flaps began to drag on the runway. Having thus determined that the environmental and
machine elements were not likely causal factors of this
accident, we now turn to the man and man/machine aspects of
the operation,

A study of the probable sequence of events which
occurred during the approach and landing,and the factors
which influenced those events, will show more clearly the
involvement of the crew in the causal areas of the accident. In this respect, certain aspects of the approach of Flight
505 seem noteworthy.

« 27 -

One such aspect is the somewhat reversed student ~
instructor relationship which developed in the cockpit
@uring the approach. ‘This relationsnip was evident in the
decision of the captain to experience the rasponse of the
aircraft at slower speeds while on final approach. The
factors influencing this decision will be discussed later in
this report.</div>

similar model 727 aircraft. A delay of this magnitude would
then place the actuation of the spoiler lever ac a time 1
second betore the circraft touched down the second time.
fhe physical data also agree with that interpretacion. The
impact of the tail skid at, or immediately after the second
touchdown, indicates that the aircraft was operating at a
high angle of attack at that tine. Thus, in order to set up
the high descent rate reflected by this second touchdown in
wpite of the relatively high angles of attack at which the
aircraft must have been operating, it appears that the
spoilers must have been used. Since the flight engineer stated that the spoilers were
retracted shortly after their actuation, the Board can offer
no reitson for the failure of the intermittent signal to stop
before the horn switched to a continuous signal 4.5 seconds
later, unless the spoiler lever was not placed back in the
0° detent. However, the continuous signal is a warning of
an unsafe landing gear configuration which is believed to
have actuated in tnia case because the final failure of the
RMLG attsch structure broke the electrical connection to the
landing year downlock switch. A question naturally arises concerning the reason ox
reasons that control of the aircraft was lost. One &lt;eagon considered was that the captain&#x27;s seat
locking mechaniam failei at the initial touchdown, and
caused hin to strike hie head on some portion of the cabin
interior. This b.low, it was reasoned, may have rendered the
captain ¢éither unconscious or dazed, and this would account
for his aubsequert loss of control of the aircraft and his

loss of mmory. It was noted that the carrier hed
experienced problems with the adjustment and locking
mechanisus on the pilot seats in that model aircraft, and in
this particular aircraft, in April 1970. Although the Board does not dispute the captain&#x27;s
statement that he suffered loss of memory, we cannot
conclude that failure of his seat wag the cause of this. Among the reasons for our belief that failure of the
captain&#x27;s seat was not a factor in this accident are the
following:

(1) The results of the Board&#x27;s tests indicate that
Lateral wovernent of the upper torso waa required to

forces which would be required to cause this

described the various impacts, and no one
mentioned other than vertical forces in the

aircraft impacted the slope of Sara Fil. At

12. The captain had no previously documented skill deficiencies that contributed to this
accident. Conclusions
70
Aircraft Accident Report
13. Air carrier pilots’ performance would be improved by additional guidance and
training in landing techniques.
14. The flight crew’s calculation error in determining the runway length required for
landing influenced the captain’s subsequent actions during final approach and landing
by creating a sense of urgency to touch down early and initiate maximum braking
immediately.
15. Some flight crewmembers may lack proficiency in the operation of airport
performance laptop computers, or similar airplane performance computing devices,
and confusion about calculated landing distances may result in potentially hazardous
miscalculations of available runway distances after touchdown.
16. The inoperative left landing light did not impede the captain’s ability to land the
airplane.
17. The MD-11&#x27;s tendency to pitch up at ground spoiler deployment did not contribute to
the accident.
18. The handling changes incorporated in the MD-11 flight control computer-908
software upgrade will provide valuable improvements in safety during MD-11
landings.
19. With the information that is currently available from the flight data recorder, it may be
impossible to distinguish the control inputs of the MD-11 flight control computer-908
longitudinal stability augmentation system from the pilots’ control inputs.
20. The MD-11’s throttle resolver angle-driven spoiler knockdown feature did not
contribute to this accident.
21. Additional basic research to identify undesirable landing phase combinations and to
compare the overall qualitative and quantitative stability and control characteristics of
widely used, large transport-category airplanes is needed to improve certification
criteria and reduce the incidence of potentially catastrophic landing accidents.
22. The energy transmitted into the right main landing gear during the second touchdown
was 3.2 times greater than the MD-11’s maximum certificated landing energy and
was sufficient to fully compress (bottom) the right main landing gear strut and cause
structural failure of the right wing rear spar.
23. The structural failure of the right wing rear spar resulted in the rupture of the right
wing fuel tanks and fire.
24. The failure modes and effects for vertically fused and overdesigned landing gear
designs may have been inadequately researched to identify whether, under overload
conditions, one design might provide a safer break-up sequence for the airplane than
the other design. Conclusions

Aircraft Accident Report
25. Current manufacturer guidance for hard landing identification and operator
maintenance readouts and analysis of flight data recorder data following suspected
hard landings may not be adequate to identify landings in which structural damage
may have occurred.
26. Risks to firefighters and the surrounding community were minimized substantially
because the incident commander assumed that hazardous materials were on board and
acted accordingly.
27. The Newark accident demonstrates that air carriers transporting hazardous materials
continue to need a means to quickly retrieve and provide consolidated, specific
information to emergency responders about the identity of all hazardous materials on
an airplane. 3.2
Probable Cause
The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of
this accident was the captain’s overcontrol of the airplane during the landing and his
failure to execute a go-around from a destabilized flare. Contributing to the accident was
the captain’s concern with touching down early to ensure adequate stopping distance.

Recommendations
4.1
New Recommendations
As a result of the investigation of this accident, the National Transportation Safety
Board makes the following recommendations:
To the Federal Aviation Administration:
Convene a joint government-industry task force composed, at a minimum,
of representatives of manufacturers, operators, pilot labor organizations,
and the Federal Aviation Administration to develop, within 1 year, a pilot
training tool to do the following:
Include information about factors that can contribute to structural
failures involving the landing gear, wings, and fuselage, such as
design sink rate limits; roll angle limits; control inputs’ roll rate;
pitch rate; single-gear landings; the effect of decreased lift; and
structural loading consequences of bottoming landing gear struts
and tires; (A-00-92)
Provide a syllabus for simulator training on the execution of
stabilized approaches to the landing flare, the identification of
unstabilized landing flares, and recovery from these situations,
including proper high sink rate recovery techniques during flare to
landing, techniques for avoiding and recovering from overcontrol
in pitch before touchdown, and techniques for avoiding overcontrol
and premature derotation during a bounced landing; (A-00-93) and
Promote an orientation toward a proactive go-around. (A-00-94)
Require principal operations inspectors assigned to Part 121 carriers that
use auxiliary performance computers to review and ensure the adequacy of
training and procedures regarding the use of this equipment and the
interpretation of the data generated, including landing distance data.
(A-00-95)
Require the installation, within 1 year, of the MD-11 flight control
computer-908 software upgrade on all MD-11 airplanes. (A-00-96)</div>

44
Aircraft Accident Report
After the airplane’s third touchdown, the data showed three simultaneous events
indicating that the pitch uncoupling mechanism had uncoupled. First, the control column
positions deviated from their normally recorded deviations. Second, the left and right
elevators began to move independently of each other. Last, the FDR pitch uncoupling
parameter showed “warn.” None of these events were present before the third touchdown. Therefore, the Safety Board concludes that the pitch control uncoupling mechanism
uncoupled when the airplane touched down for the third time; as a result, the pitch
uncoupling would not have prevented the flight crew from controlling or safely landing
the airplane. 
2.7
Failure of the Left Main Landing Gear 
CVR, FDR, and wreckage and impact information indicated that the airplane’s
third touchdown severely damaged the left MLG, which caused it to fracture
circumferentially at its vertical trunnion leg just below the actuator attach point. Examination of the fracture surfaces revealed evidence of overload failure. No evidence of
preexisting defects was found. The ATR-72 landing gear and associated structure were designed to absorb energy
equivalent to a maximum airplane descent rate of 10 fps when landing at the airplane’s
maximum design landing weight (consistent with the landing design limits imposed by
14 CFR 25.473 to 25.487). However, the Safety Board’s airplane performance study
determined that, when the airplane touched down for the third time, the left MLG touched
down at a descent rate of about 19 to 32 fps. Therefore, the Safety Board concludes that,
when the airplane touched down for the third time, the vertical forces on the left MLG
exceeded those that the gear was designed to withstand, and these excessive forces
resulted in overload failure.

Conclusions 3.1
Findings
1.
The captain was properly certificated and qualified under Federal regulations. No
evidence indicated any preexisting medical or physical conditions that might have
adversely affected his performance during the accident flight. The first officer held a
current Federal Aviation Administration airman medical certificate at the time of the
accident; however, he failed to provide information about his medical condition
(anxiety) or his use of the prescription drug alprazolam when he applied for the
certificate.
2.
The airplane was properly certificated, equipped, and maintained in accordance with
Federal regulations and approved company procedures. The airplane was loaded in
accordance with approved company weight and balance procedures. The weight and
balance of the airplane were within limits during all phases of the flight.
3.
Winds were within the airplane’s performance capabilities and did not adversely
affect the flight crew’s ability to maneuver the airplane during the approach and
landing as significant aircraft control authority remained.

(3) Findings

i, The only evidence of an aircraft malfunction was the
extended position of the ground spotler panels at impact,

The elevator trim tab position waz full nosedown to the
electrical trim stop. The aileron manual trim wae sec
9.5° left wing down,

The landing gear and the wing flaps were retracted at
impact. The right and left ground spoilers were unlocked and exe
tended in flight. Their exact position could not be deter~
mined, The inboard and outboard flight svoLlers on each
wing were extended betwaen 24° and 55°, and 24° and 35°,
respectively,

The left ground spoiler panel actuator was fractured,
probably by high afrloads,

The cause of tha unwanted ground spotler extension was
probably a hot electrical short which bypassed the four
ground spoiler interlecks installed in the syetem,

The extension of the ground spoilers caused the flight
Spoilers to extend,

e 1 «

This unwantes extension of the spoilers occurred at a
relatively low airspeed and when the aircraft was ina
landing apprcach configuration,

The unwanted extension of the epollers resulted in an upset
and a rapid less of altitude. The pilots provably attempted recovery from this upset by
retracting the guar and flaps, increasing pewer, and ace
celerating the airplane to a speed of mre than 300 kn,

The resulting high airloads failed the actuator rod of
the left ground spoiler whch resulted in lateral asymmetry

elevator trim tab to the full nosedown position,

The pilots were unable to miincain pitch control ard had
dnsufficfent altitude in which to recover from the ensuing
dive, (b) Probable Cause

The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of the accident was an unwanted oxtension of the ground and
flight spoilers, which resulted in a loss of control at an altitude from
which recovery could not be made. The ground spoilers probably deployed
because of a hot electrical short {{n the spoiler extend circuitry, Whereas the spoilers probably deployed symnatrically, the left ground spoiler
actuator fatled in flight and caused a loss of lateral control. The sudsequent loss of pitch cuntrol was caused by the full nosedcwn elevator
trim tab position and the high airceaft speed.

3, RECOMMENDATIONS

On August 14, 1974, the Safety Board submitted Safety Recommendation
A~-74=61 to the Administrator, Federal Aviation Administration. A copy of
tha recommendation and the FAA&#x27;s response is contained in App .ndix E. The Grumman American Aviation Corporation has forwarded proposed
changes in the Jongitudinal trim and ground spoiler systems to the Federal
Aviation Administration for approval, The FAA has approved a change to
the longitudinal trim system which has been published as Aircraft Service
Change 186. The FAA has also issued a Notice of Proposed Rule Making in
the Federal Register (Volume 40, Nuirber 41, Page 8568, dated February 28,
1975) to require mandatory compliance with Aircraft Service Change No,
186, Another modification of the longitudinal system replacoment of the

- 16 =
single element trim switch with a double element switch is being prepared
for FAA consideration. A proposal to change the flight power shutoff system is being prepared and completion is expected by Grumman by September 1975, Upon com&gt;
pletion, this proposal will be forwarded to the FAA for approval. BY THE NATIONAL Th NSPORTATION SAFBTY BOARD

in the takeoff position. Loss of power becaure of throttle mismanagement ie aleo a possible
contributing factor, Unintentional seduction of power to the extent that
flight could not be maintained could have resulted from incapacitation of
the flight engineer. Power reduction could also occur subtly if the
crewmembers failed to monitor the throttle friction tock. A factor that could have caused the crewmenbers&#x27; attention to be misdirected was the necessity to override the landing gear safaty solenoid
manually in order to retract the gear. This operation required two hands,
since the gear handle is on the aft, lower part of the center pedestal,
and the solenoid is recessed inside a hole on the lower right side of tha
center pedestal. An inexperienced and unqualified first officer might
have needed assistance tu retract the gear. Witnesses reported that the landing gear was raised late in tha takeoff and the landing gear was found in the full &quot;up&quot; position in the wreckage, The flight enginear would have had difficulty reaching either the
gear handle or the solenoid. Therefore, the captain or the first officer
could have been occupied raising the tanding gear during the critical
initial portion of the flighc. This fact, coupled with the loose throttle
friction, may have set the etege for the throttles to creep back during
the takeoff. In each of the preceding situations, the captain&#x27;s unexplainable
high COHb Level, the physiological condition of the flight engineer, and
the dnexperience of the first officer may have comp&#x27;icated events at a
critical time and, theri fore, contributed to the accident. 2.2 Conclusions

a. Findings

1. The aircraft was certificated and maintained in accordance
with 14 CFR 91; however, there were some discrepancies that
had not been corrected. There was no evidence of preimpact structural or flight control failure, fire, or powerplant failure. The captain and the first officer were certificated properly;
however, only the captain was qualified for the flight. The first officer did not meet the requirements of
14 CFR 91.213. The flight engineer lacked recency of experience as required
by 14 CFR 91.211 and was not medically qualified for the
flight,

The captain&#x27;s blood contained eufficient COHb to have adversely influenced his vision, coordination, and judznent,

The flight engineer&#x27;s blood contained sufficient meprobamate

The landing gear safety solenoid had to be depressed manually in order to raise the gear handle, and the throttle
friction lock on the pilot&#x27;s quadrant and at the flight
engineer&#x27;s station would not secure the throttles adequately.</div>

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS AND CONCLUSIONS &gt; ANALYSIS] All applicable airworthinass directives had heen corplied with. There was no evidence of an in-flight fire or exnlosion, structural
failure, flight control malfunctfon, or syetems fuitlure. Although the
elevator boost unit was in tha manual or boost “off position in the
wreckage, the position was cousistent with the impact damage it sustained. In addition, the boost lever in the cockpit was in the &quot;on&quot; position,

The primary hydraulic syatem&#x27;s low-pressure warning Light had a
stretched filament, which sugiests that it was illuminated at impact, [It
was probably triggered when the left wing struck the first -uilding and
destroyed the primary system angine pumps and lines, Hydraulic pressure
gauges reflected that there had been system pressure before impact. Since
the landing gear was retracted’ after lift-off, the secondary system was
operable. Since it automatically backs up the primary, if the primary
system had failed, the functioning secondary system would have powered
the controls, Thus, the elevator control boost unit did not malfunction
because of hydraulic power loss, In addition, teardown and testing revealed there was no evidence of a preimpact malfurction nor did maintenance records indicate a history of elevator control problems, On the
basis of these findings, hydraulic system failures were discounted as a
causal. factor. Examination and testing of the engines, propellers, and their pertinent accessories and components shoved that they were operating normally
at impact. The blades of the four propellers were found on the low pitch
stop. There are three porsible explanations for this finding: (1) Extremely low airspeed at impact; (2) the engines were not operating and
the propellers were windmnilling on the low pitch stop; (3) the engines
were operating with the engine power levers pulled back to the &quot;Idle&quot;
position,

Based on witnesses&#x27; observations, the damage pattern of the propel-~
lera, and the syimmetrical blade angles at impact, the power levers must
have been retarded just before impact. This is furcher substantiated by
the fact that even at low airspeeds, the propeller blade angles should be
at 18°, or higher, at takeoff power settings. The leak found in the low-pitch stop assembly of the No. 2 propeller
indicates that this propeller could not have been placed into the reverse
position. Since the stretched filament of the associated reversing light
bulb suggests that this light was illuminated, the light was probably
triggered during the impact sequence. Since there is no physical evidence of engine problems, the vuriations in engine sounds are attributed to power ssanagement procedures or

- 14-6

creeping throttles. Therefore, the mechanical condition of the engines
and propellers was nvt related to the direct cause of the accident,

The consensus of the witnesses’ statements was that the aircraft
rctated abruptly to an unusually high pitch attitude and tat the short
duration level flight after takeoff was essentially flown in a similar
attitude and at a slow spead.</div>

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] Because the airplane was not in the go-around
configuration, the Safety Board attempted to establish whether the airplane configuration
at impact was caused by a preimpact failure or malfunction of an airplane system, an
erroneous flightcrew decision, or the flightcrew&#x27;s failure to implement the go-around
procedure in a timely manner. Since all the wreckage was located at or beyond the initial impact point and &gt;
close examination of the structural failures and breakup indicated that all failures and
breaks were the result of impact or overload, the Safety Board concludes that an inflight
structural failure did not occur.

t

The onsite examination and subsequent engine tear down inspection showed
that both engines were operating at high thrust settings at impact. Although the Safety
Board concludes that the engines did not contribute to the accident, it was not possible to
ascertain precisely the engine thrust setting at impact, or when the thrust had been set to
the levels evidenced by the impact damage to the engines. The landing gear was down and locked, and the landing gear selector handle
was found in the down position. During a go-around procedure, the landing gear could not
be raised until after the flaps were raised to the 20° position and a positive rate of climb
had been established. Therefore, since the flaps were still extended to 45%, it appears that
the landing gear selector handle was properly positioned, and that the flighterew had
initiated a go-around by advancing the thrust levers very shortly before crashing into the
mountain.

2.1 Electrical System

The evidence was conclusive that there was no preimpact failure in the a.e.
electric generating and distribution system. The examination of the annunciator light
bulbs in the AC Power Management Panel did not reveal that any generator was
inoperative, or overloaded, or that the No.1 or No. 2 main bus off warning lights were
illuminated at impact. A similar examination of the Essential AC Power Transfer Panel
disclosed that the failure and transfer warning lights were not lit, thus, indicating that the
essential a.c. bus was powered by the No. 1 a.c. bus. ;

To further determine that the three main a.c. buses -- No. 1, No. 2, and
essential - were functioning at impact, operation of one or more pieces of equipment
which were dependent on power supplied from each bus was established. Hydraulic pump
No. 3B, yaw damper No. 2, and the No. 1 TR units cooling fan, all of which were powered
by the No. 1 a.c bus, were operating at impact. Also, the No. 2 TR unit&#x27;s cooling fan,
which was powered by the No. 2 a.c. bus, was operating at impact. Further, the air data
computer, yaw damper No.1, and the No.3 TR unit&#x27;s cooling fan, all of which were
powered by the essential a.c. bus, were operating at impact.</div>

not record the pilots completing the Engine/Fire/Damage/Separation checklist. Specifically, they 
did not start the APU, turn the fuel crossfeed on, or set the hydraulic system. About 1319:59, the flight crew attempted to extend the landing gear; however, the gear 
indicator lights did not provide valid information about gear status. Neither pilot detected the 
absence of the normal increase in cockpit noise associated with the extension of the nose landing 
gear67 or the loss of hydraulic pressure on the right side, which they might have detected if they 
had taken time to distribute their tasks and to become more deliberate and focused. Noticing 
these conditions might have helped them to detect the nose landing gear problem earlier. However, the NTSB recognizes that the detection of this anomaly would have been more 
difficult because of the errant cockpit indications caused by the fire-induced electrical problems. As events continued, rushing through and skipping tasks continued to cause problems for 
the pilots. The first officer asked ATC to verify whether the landing gear had extended. ATC 
responded that the main gear appeared to be down but that the nose gear did not appear to be 
down. If the pilots had continued performing the Engine Fire/Damage/Separation checklist, they 
would have reached the item to set the hydraulic systems, which would have provided them with 
an opportunity to notice the hydraulic anomalies that were being caused by the engine fire. If the 
pilots had detected the hydraulic anomalies, the pilots should have completed the checklist and 
then initiated the Left or Right Hydraulic Pressure Low or Hydraulic Quantity Low or 
Decreasing checklist. The first step on both checklists was to turn off the hydraulic transfer pump 
switch, which would have allowed the right hydraulic system to pressurize and enabled the nose 
gear to fully extend. The CVR did not record the flight crew performing either checklist during 
the flight. According to American Airlines, pilots were trained to check hydraulic pressure and 
quantity indications before responding to the hydraulic system-related item on the Engine 
Fire/Damage/Separation checklist. The NTSB concludes that the pilots’ interruption of the emergency Engine 
Fire/Damage/Separation checklist at a critical point prolonged the fire and led to additional 
problems, including the loss of hydraulic pressure, which caused the nose landing gear to fail to 
extend. 
2.4.3 Decision to Go Around 
After ATC verified that the nose landing gear had not extended, the captain decided to 
execute a go-around. During postaccident interviews, the captain stated that, by the time he was 
aware that the nose landing gear had not extended, the airplane was too low and close to the 
airport to manually extend the nose landing gear and that, even though fire indications were still 
alerting in the cockpit, he no longer trusted the annunciators because of the airplane’s electrical 
anomalies. The captain also stated that he did not want to attempt a landing without the nose gear

Safety Board believes that the spoilers were still extended. It was noted during the flight 
test that there is little difference in cockpit ::tal 
background noise level with spoilers 
either extended or retracted when the gear and flaps are down to alert the pilot that the 
spoilers are extended. The fourth profile of the test flight flown at Bradley International 
revealed that it took about 90 percent of power to maintain level flight with the gear and 
flaps down with spoilers extended. The engine teardown revealed that engines were 
operating at about 90 to 92 percent rpm at impact. Power required to maintain Level 
flight with spoilers retracted is about 87 percent. Consequently, the spoilers extended 
configuration only requires 3 percent more power than retracted configuration and a pilot 
could overlook the difference in power particularly if the spoiler warning lights were not 
lit. It is postillated that as the airplane passed over the approach lights, the pilot realized 
that the spoilers were extended and retracted them. The nose of the aircraft would have 
risen slightly due to spoiler retraction, but since the right spoiler did not retract the 
aimlane started a slow roE to the right. While the pilot sdded power, he apparently did 
not use enough aileron and rudder control input to arrest the roll, srd the airplane rolled 
inverted and crashed.

have been associated with engine surges (compressor stalls) that could have accompanied
an attempted relight and acceleration of engines in the presence of turbulent air. However, engine thrust variations alone, even with a total flameout, cannot
explain the loss of lateral control. Simulator tests showed that the asymmetrical thrust
differences produced by a failure of one engine or a 5-second split in engine acceleration
were easily handled with flight controls assuming all hydraulics systems were operational. The simulator tests showed that thrust differentials consistent with the signatures from the
CVR would produce some yawing and rolling moments. However, at the airspeeds
recorded on the FDR, the effects of asymmetric thrust would have been minimal and well
within the capability of the airplane&#x27;s lateral and directional control systems. The Safety Board also considered the effects that a failure of one or both engines
would have on the airplane&#x27;s hydraulic systems. In the B-737, the A hydraulic system is
powered by engine-driven hydraulic pumps on both engines. Either pump is capable of
maintaining the system operating pressure while delivering 22 gallons per minute flow. At
engine windmilling speed, the flow capability of the pumps drops to 4 or 5 gallons per
minute. However, even with maximum utilization of the flight controls, including a
simultaneous flap retraction, the flow requirement would be about 4 gallons per minute. Thus, even with a complete flameout of both engines, there should be adequate hydraulic
power available to the A hydraulic system to provide for flight control. Also, as an engine
accelerates from windmilling speed, the flow capacity of the engine-driven pump
increases immediately. Further evidence of normal hydraulic capability on the A system
was provided by the elapsed time for flap retraction. The time from the sound of flap
handle movement recorded on the CVR to impact was consistent with the normal flap
retraction speed from the 30-degree position to the 10-degree position as found after the
crash. The B hydraulic system is powered by two electrical motor-driven hydraulic
pumps, each of which is capable of maintaining system pressure while producing
6 gallons per minute flow. It is possible that, at engine windmilling speed, the constant
speed drive would not maintain the electrical generator frequency and the associated
electrical buss would drop off line. However, if this had occurred, the FDR and CVR,
which are powered by the same busses, would have ceased to operate. Since there is no
evidence of an interruption of electrical power to either of the recorders, the Safety Board
concludes that the electrical busses and the respective electrical motor-driven hydraulic
pumps remained powered throughout the flight. With both the A and B hydraulic systems operating, it can be assumed that, absent
some other unidentified failure, there was sufficient control capability to cope with any
combination of engine thrust variations.</div>

or failure of the horizontal stabilizer. Numerous examinations of the wreckage failed to produce evidence of preimpact
structural problems. Engine mount separation points showed evidence of impact overload. All doors were closed and latched. The Safety Board considered the possibility that the “mist” trailing the wing
observed by witnesses was produced by fuel or hydraulic fluid resulting from a structural
failure of some nature. However, the investigation disclosed no evidence of a structural
failure that would have allowed fuel or hydraulic fluid to escape. 
2.4
Systems
From the flightcrew conversations recorded on the CVR and the flightpath
described by FDR data, it is evident that the loss of control occurred suddenly and that the Analysis
119
Aircraft Accident Report
crew were not aware of any prior problems with the airplane&#x27;s systems. However, the
lateral upset and the flightpath of the airplane during the final 9 seconds of flight could
have resulted from a flight control system malfunction. Thus, the Safety Board&#x27;s
investigation focused on an examination of the wreckage and all recovered components of
the airplane&#x27;s hydraulic and flight control systems in an effort to identify any anomalies
that could have produced the loss of control. The onset of the loss of control occurred nearly 30 seconds after the flaps were
extended to 30 degrees. The trailing edge flaps and leading edge devices would have
began extending immediately and would have reached the command position before the
first officer&#x27;s comment, “we&#x27;re at a thousand feet,” which was made in a tone of voice that
did not express unusual alarm. Thus, the Safety Board concludes that the flap operation
was symmetrical and normal.
2.4.1 Hydraulic Power
The primary flight controls of the B-737 are powered by the independent A and B
hydraulic systems previously discussed in section 2.2. A loss of fluid or pressure from
either of these systems would result in a loss or degradation of some flight control
functions. However, the Safety Board found no indications that the systems had
malfunctioned, except for a stretched bulb filament in the HYD indicating light on the
first officer&#x27;s annunciator panel. Because several other light bulb filaments were stretched,
some of which would normally illuminate only in a press-to-test check, the Board does
not view this evidence as meaningful. The evidence also shows that the motor-operated shutoff valves in both the system
A and System B flight control modules were open and that the motor-operated shutoff
valves in the standby hydraulic system module were off or closed. Because impact loads
do not usually affect the position of motor-operated valves, it is assumed that the systems
were operated in this normal configuration before impact. Had the flightcrew been aware
of an A or B hydraulic system problem, it would be expected that they would have talked
about it and perhaps selected the standby system. Thus, the Safety Board believes that the
A and B systems were pressurized and capable of delivering hydraulic power to the flight
controls. The teardown examination of the hydraulic components showed considerable
evidence of contamination in the A, B, and standby systems.</div>

trapped in filter housings. In those cases where contaminants were found to potentially
affect the function of relief or check valves, it was determined that there would have been
no effect on essential flight control components. While the level of contamination in the
hydraulic systems of this airplane seemed excessive, the Safety Board did not determine
whether the level was atypical to that which would be found on other airplanes of

Aircraft Accident Report
2.4.2 Flight Control Systems
From the FDR data, it is apparent that the airplane&#x27;s departure from controlled
flight began with a sudden heading change to the right. A lateral or directional flight
control problem could produce such a maneuver whereas a longitudinal control system
malfunction would produce a pitching maneuver evident by a sudden change in the
airplane&#x27;s load factor. A pitch change was not evident in the FDR data. There were no anomalies found in the longitudinal flight control components that
were available for examination. The elevators were recovered at the accident site and the
horizontal stabilizer was trimmed in a normal range. During the attempted recovery from
the upset, the airplane&#x27;s load factor increased to about 4 G--a maneuver that would have
required a pilot-commanded elevator deflection. The Safety Board thus concludes that the
elevator control system was functional until impact. The lateral control system consists of ailerons and flight spoilers controllable by
the captain&#x27;s and first officer&#x27;s control wheels. The aileron power control units provided
evidence that the ailerons were at or near neutral at impact. There were no anomalies
noted in the actuators that could account for an uncommanded movement. Although there
was some conflicting evidence regarding flight spoiler position, all of the damage was
consistent with impact-applied loads. The aileron spring cartridge, which is installed to
permit independent operation of the left or right ailerons in the event that the opposite side
of the aileron system becomes jammed, was bent and extended. This damage also was
readily explainable by impact loading and is not viewed by the Safety Board as evidence
of an in-flight problem. Thus, there was no evidence that a lateral control system
malfunction occurred in flight. There is also no evidence that a ground spoiler deployed to cause the lateral upset. The condition of the ground spoiler control valve slide was consistent with a retracted
spoiler position. Further, had either the flight or ground spoilers been extended in flight,
the airplane would not have been able to achieve a 4-G load factor at 212 KIAS without
activating the stall warning stick shaker. The sound of the stick shaker was not heard on
the CVR.</div>

Findings
1. The two-member flightcrew and three flight attendants were trained and
qualified to conduct the flight in accordance with Federal regulations. There was no evidence of
any medical condition that might have affected the flightcrew’s performance.
2. The air traffic control request to maintain 190 knots to the outer marker did not
contribute to the accident because it did not affect crew actions, decisionmaking, or situational
awareness.
3. The airplane was certificated and equipped and maintained in accordance with
Federal regulations and approved procedures. There is no evidence that mechanical malfunctions
or failures of the airplane structures, flight control systems, or powerplants contributed to the
accident.
4. Because the captain omitted the “Hydraulics” item on the in-range checklist
and the first officer failed to detect the error, hydraulic pressure was not available to lower the
landing gear and deploy the flaps.
5. The “Hydraulics” item is placed too low on the in-range checklist, rendering it
vulnerable to omission.
6. The captain’s distraction from his duties as pilot-in-command and his disregard
for the sterile cockpit rule contributed to the pilots’ failure to detect their hydraulic system
configuration error when they selected 5o of flaps.
7. Both the captain and the first officer recognized that the flaps had not extended
after the flaps were selected to 15o.
8. The pilots’ lack of previous exposure, either through training or during line
operations, to the consequences of improper hydraulic system configuration contributed to their
failure to detect their hydraulic system configuration error.
9. The pilots failed to perform the landing checklist and to detect the numerous
cues alerting them to the status of the landing gear because of their focus on coping with the flap
extension problem and the high level of workload as a result of the rapid sequence of events in
the final minute of the flight.
10. Had the landing checklist been properly performed, the flightcrew would have
detected the failure of the landing gear to extend.

56
11. Although the first officer was unwilling to overtly challenge the captain’s
decision to continue the approach, he did attempt to communicate his concern about the
excessive speed of the approach to the captain.
12. There was no compelling reason for the captain’s decision to land the
airplane; multiple signals and guidance indicated that the approach should be discontinued, as did
Continental Airlines’ standard operating procedures.
13. The flightcrew’s degraded performance is consistent with the effects of
fatigue, but there is insufficient information to determine the extent to which it contributed to the
accident.
14. There were deficiencies in Continental Airlines’ (COA) oversight of its pilots
and the principal operations inspector’s oversight of COA.</div>

hydraulic system, this crew detected a problem with flap deployment when the airplane did not
respond with pitch and speed changes as flaps were selected to 15o and beyond. However, this

hydraulic system configuration. Neither the captain nor the first officer recalled events concerning
improper hydraulic system configuration in his previous DC-9 experience and, therefore, did not

information about the flaps.

possess firsthand knowledge to help recognize that the symptom he was experiencing was the
result of this error. In addition, the Safety Board’s review of the information provided by COA to its
pilots concerning the DC-9 hydraulic system revealed that the flight manual and training
materials do not explicitly state that if the pumps are not switched to “HI,” the landing gear will
not extend and the flaps will not deploy. The Safety Board concludes that the pilots’ lack of
previous exposure, either through training or during line operations, to the consequences of
improper hydraulic system configuration contributed to their failure to detect their hydraulic
system configuration error. The Safety Board believes that the FAA should require all POIs of 14 CFR Part
121 operators using DC-9 and MD-80 airplanes with the “HI, LOW, OFF” hydraulic switch
configuration to ensure that operating manuals and training programs include information about
the consequences of improper hydraulic system configuration, specifically that the flaps and
landing gear will not function normally if the engine-driven hydraulic pumps are not set to “HI.”
2.2.4
Failure to Perform Landing Checklist and Confirm Gear Position
In accordance with company procedures, the first officer called for the landing
checklist after the gear-down call. Although he placed the gear handle in the down position, the
captain never initiated the checklist. Because the flaps remained stowed, the airplane did not slow during the approach. Traveling at a speed of approximately 200 knots, the airplane covered the distance between the
outer marker and the runway threshold in about 75 seconds. If the target approach speed of 132
knots had been maintained, it would have taken about 115 seconds to cover this distance. The
increase in speed allowed the flightcrew very little time to address the flap problem and
configure the airplane for landing. In the 27 seconds that elapsed from the time the captain said “I think the flaps *”
to the time the first officer stated “I don’t have flaps,” the captain manipulated the throttles and
then responded to the gear-down call, the flaps 25 call, the flaps 40 call, and the flaps 50 call. The captain had very little time to react to the directives he was being given by the first officer.</div>

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] Therefore, it is unlikely
that the norm contributed to the captain’s failure to properly configure the hydraulic system. However, the existence of informal norms, the findings from the line checks conducted after the
accident, and the recent history of flightcrew-related accidents at COA raises concerns that an
operational climate may have existed in which crews occasionally deviated from standard
operating procedures. This significant issue is addressed in section 2.4 of this analysis. In summary, the Safety Board found no evidence indicating that the captain was
interrupted or distracted during the performance of the in-range checklist, that the omitted
checklist item was obscured, or that the captain believed the first officer would configure the
hydraulic system. The Safety Board was unable to determine the specific reason for the captain’s
omission of the “Hydraulics” item on the in-range checklist. The COA DC-9 Flight Manual states that both pilots are responsible for visual
confirmation that all checklist items are completed. The first officer’s response to two items on
the checklist, “Flight Instruments, Altimeters” and “Shoulder Harness,” indicates that he was
aware that the in-range checklist was being completed. However, the first officer did not detect
the captain’s omission of the “Hydraulics” item. The Safety Board concludes that because the
captain omitted the “Hydraulics” item on the in-range checklist and the first officer failed to
detect the error, hydraulic pressure was not available to lower the landing gear and deploy the
flaps. The Safety Board is concerned that the normal in-flight operating procedure for
the DC-9 hydraulic system deactivates (or, in the case of the MD-80, impairs the operation of)
certain hydraulic components, including the landing gear and the flaps, without providing an
overt signal to the flightcrew of the non-functional status of those components. If the hydraulic
system is not configured properly during performance of the in-range checklist, the error can
initially only be determined by direct observation of the hydraulic pump switches and pressure
gauges. Because the flaps and landing gear are not typically extended until the later stages of an
approach, the next opportunity for the flightcrew to detect such an error occurs during a period of
higher workload when there is less time for problem diagnosis. The February 1995 ASRS report and statements by other DC-9 pilots indicate that
failure to configure the hydraulic system for landing is not an uncommon occurrence.38 A review
of checklists from several DC-9 and MD-80 operators revealed that none of the checklists,
including the Douglas Aircraft Company’s checklist, emphasize the importance of the

“Hydraulics” item by placing it as the first item on the in-range checklist or requiring mandatory
cross-check of the item by both pilots. Further, the item requires only an “ON &amp; HI,
CHECKED” response to the challenge and does not require verbal notation of the pressure
values. NASA-sponsored research on checklist design39 indicates that critical items should be
placed first on a checklist because the probability of successfully accomplishing the first items on
a checklist is the highest.</div>

6. The antiskid control valves. There are two hydraulic valves that regulate
hydraulic fluid flow to the wheel brakes. These valves operate through an antiskid control unit. Since the mainwheel brakes were inoperative during the
accident sequence, the failure of these valves cid not affect the outcome of

The tests accomplished on the deHavilland hydraulic test stand indicate that as the fire
breached the left system hydraulic lines, the hydraulic pressure from the No. 1 engine-driven
hydraulic pump to the No. 1 hydraulic reservoir dropped rapidly. The differential piston within the
pump and the diaphragm in the reservoir then relaxed io the point where normal hydraulic pump
inlet pressure in the reservoir rapidly dropped to near 6 psi. The No. 1 hydraulic pump then
cavitated because of the loss of pump inlet pressure. Had the pump not cavitated, the hydraulic test stand experiments indicate that most of the
fluid in the reservoir would have been expelled from the system through the breached lines. This
also would have caused the loss of all left system hydraulic components. Last, the No. 1 electcic-standby hydraulic pump was rendered inoperative because wiring from
its power source (the No. 2 contactor junction box in the right nacelle) was burned severely. The
crosstie circuitry (also located in the right nacelle) that would have allawed the pump to operate
from the No. 1 generator was destroyed! alsa. if this pump nad been operating, the outcome of the

documentation and analysis of the No. 2 engine components and surrounding 
structure, led the Safety Board to conclude that the No. 2 engine stage 1 fan 
disk fracture and separation was the initial event that led to the liberation 
of engine rotating parts with sufficient energy to penetrate the airplane&#x27;s 
structure. 
· 
· 
Shortly after the engine failure, the crew noted that the hydraulic 
fluid pressure and quantity had fallen to zero in the three systems. Approximately l minute after the engine failure, the FDR recorded no further 
powered movement of the flight control surfaces. Consequently, the No. 2 
engine failure precipitated severe damage that breached the three hydraulic 
systems, leaving the flight control systems inoperative. Titanium alloy was found on the fracture surfaces of severed lines 
of hydraulic systems No. 1 and No. 3 located in the right horizontal 
stabilizer. Several of the major components of the engine, including the 
stage I fan blades and fan disk, were made from titanium alloy and no other 
components of the surrounding airframe were made from such material. These 
factors led the Safety Board to conclude that the systems&#x27; No. 1 and No. 3 
hydraulic lines were severed by fragments released during the failure 
sequence of the No. 2 engine. The loss of hydraulic system No. 2 required further analysis. The 
engine-driven No. 2 hydraulic pumps were attached to and received power from 
the No. 2 engine accessory section. This unit was mounted to the engine 
directly below the fan section of the engine. Portions of the No. 2 engine 
accessory section and associated No. 2 hydraulic system components, including 
hydraulic supply hoses, were found in the Alta, Iowa, area. Therefore, 
portions of the No. 2 hydraulic system and supply hoses mounted on, or 
adjacent to, the No. 2 engine accessory section were damaged and separated by 
the forces and disruption of the engine fan section during the engine 
failure. The investigation disclosed no evidence of other system anomalies 
that would have contributed to the hydraulic system or flight control 
difficulties experienced in the accident. 
2.3 
Performance of UAL 232 Flightcrew 
Because of the loss of the three hydraulic systems, the flightcrew 
was confronted with a unique situation that 1 eft them with very limited 
control of the airplane. The only means available to fly the airplane was 
through manipulation of thrust available from the No. 1 and No. 3 engines. The primary task confronting the flightcrew was controlling the airplane on 
its flightpath during the long period (about 60 seconds) of the &quot;phugoid&quot; or 
pitch oscillation.</div>

Douglas Aircraft Company, the FAA, and UAL considered the total 
loss of. hydraulic-powered flight controls_ so remote as to negate any 
requirement for an appropriate procedure to counter such a situation. The 
most comparable maneuver that the fl ightcrew was required to accomplish 
satisfactorily in a DC-10 simulator was the procedure for managing the 
failure of two of the three hydraulic systems; however, during this training, 
the remaining system.was available for movement of the flight controls. The 
CVR 
recorded 
the flightcrew&#x27;s discussion of procedures, 
possible solutions, and courses of action in dealing with the loss of 
hydraulic system flight controls, as well as the methods of attempting an 
emergency landing. The captain&#x27;s acceptance of the check airman to assist 
in the cockpit was positive and appropriate. The Safety Board views the 
interaction of the pilots, including the check airman, during the emergency 
as indicative of the value of cockpit resource management training, which has 
been in existence at UAL for a decade. The loss of the normal manner of flight control, combined with an 
airframe vi brat ion and the visual assessment of the damage by crewmembers, 
led the flightcrew to conclude that the structural integrity of the airplane 
was in jeopardy and that it was necessary to expedite an emergency landing. Interaction between the fl i ghtcrew and the UAL system aircraft maintenance 
network (SAM) did not lead to beneficial guidance. UAL flight operations 
attempted to ask the flightcrew to consider diverting to Lincoln, Nebraska. However, the information was sent through flight dispatch and did not reach 
the flightcrew in time to have altered their decision to land at the Sioux 
Gateway Airport.

The simulator reenactment of the events leading to the crash 
landing revealed that 1 ine fl ightcrews could not be taught to control the 
airplane and land safely without hydraulic power available to operate the 
flight controls. The results of the simulator experiments showed that a 
landing attempt under these conditions involves many variables that affect 
the extent of controllability during the approach and landing.</div>

1.3.5.3 Previous Dual-Hydraulic AS350-Series Helicopter Events Involving Loss of 
Yaw Control 
On April 9, 2014, an Airbus Helicopters AS350 B3e crashed into a hospital rooftop in 
Albuquerque, New Mexico, after departing from the hospital’s heliport. The helicopter was 
operating under the provisions of 14 CFR Part 91 as a local positioning flight. The pilot and two 
medical technicians received minor injuries, and the helicopter was substantially damaged.31 The 
pilot reported that he completed the preflight hydraulic check and did not note anything abnormal

with the pedal movement. During the takeoff, the pilot expected to make a slight left turn to clear 
the heliport platform and hospital for departure, but the helicopter kept turning. The pilot attempted 
to apply right pedal to stop the turn but reported that the pedals felt jammed or locked in the neutral 
position. The helicopter began spinning to the left. Although the yaw servo hydraulic switch was found in the “ON” position, the switch’s 
position at takeoff could not be determined because of the lack of an onboard image recorder. The 
NTSB determined that the probable cause of the accident was “the pilot’s loss of yaw control 
during takeoff due to the absence of hydraulic boost to the tail rotor pedals for reasons that could 
not be determined based on the available information.” A finding in the accident was “the lack of 
a caution indicator to alert the pilot of the lower hydraulic system configuration.” 
During the investigation of the Albuquerque accident, the NTSB learned about a 
2009 event involving a Eurocopter AS350 B3 helicopter with a dual hydraulic system that was 
operated by the US Customs and Border Protection.</div>

11. The flight nurse in the left aft seat had likely been restrained in his seat and was likely ejected 
from the helicopter with his seat during the accident sequence. 
12. The impact forces of this accident were survivable for the helicopter occupants. 
13. If the helicopter had been equipped with a crash-resistant fuel system, the potential for thermal 
injuries to the occupants would have been reduced or eliminated. 
14. Those who purchase, lease, or contract for helicopter services and those who operate or fly 
aboard helicopters as part of their job are likely unaware that the designs of most existing and 
newly manufactured helicopters do not include the improved crashworthiness standards 
required of newly certificated helicopters, which could compromise occupant protection if an 
accident were to occur. 
15. Data to better understand the safety issues involved in this accident could likely have been 
recovered from a flight recorder system that complied with the provisions of Federal Aviation 
Administration Technical Standard Order C197, “Information Collection and Monitoring 
Systems.” 2.2 Probable Cause 
The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of this 
accident was Airbus Helicopters’ dual-hydraulic AS350 B3e helicopter’s (1) preflight hydraulic 
check, which depleted hydraulic pressure in the tail rotor hydraulic circuit, and (2) lack of salient 
alerting to the pilot that hydraulic pressure was not restored before takeoff. Such alerting might 
have cued the pilot to his failure to reset the yaw servo hydraulic switch to its correct position 
during the preflight hydraulic check, which resulted in a lack of hydraulic boost to the pedal 
controls, high pedal forces, and a subsequent loss of control after takeoff. Contributing to the 
accident was the pilot’s failure to perform a hover check after liftoff, which would have alerted 
him to the pedal control anomaly at an altitude that could have allowed him to safely land the 
helicopter. Contributing to the severity of the injuries was the helicopter’s fuel system, which was 
not crash resistant and facilitated a fuel-fed postcrash fire. NTSB

components. No engine anomalies were found other than the ground fire-produced thermal 
damage. The gas generator drive train seizure was caused by physical interference to gas generator 
accessory gear train rotation by the thermally distorted gearbox casing.45 The power turbine drive 
train seizure resulted from a temporary lockup of the reduction gear train due to thermal degradation 
of the gearbox oil.46 The absence of power turbine overspeed-related damage suggests an engine 
fuel supply interruption occurred almost coincident with the drive train arrest. Hydraulic and Flight Control System Malfunctions 
 
Examination of the wreckage and analysis of the accident site location did not reveal any 
evidence of a preimpact hydraulic failure or anomaly. The caution light warning panel was 
removed from the wreckage for further examination. An analysis of the filaments for the light 
bulb corresponding to the hydraulic system failure light revealed that the filaments were not 
stretched, indicating that they were not illuminated at impact. Careful examination of all the 
light bulbs for systems other than the pitot heat revealed that no filaments exhibited stretch, 
further indicating that no system failures had occurred. Both of the pitot heat bulbs exhibited 
minor stretch, indicating that the advisory light for the pitot heat system was illuminated at the 
time of ground impact. The investigation revealed that none of the in-flight emergencies relating to the failure of 
the hydraulic system would have required the pilot to immediately execute an emergency landing 
in sloping hazardous terrain with a prevailing tailwind. Most anomalies and emergencies of the 
hydraulic control system result in stiff controls requiring a high degree of effort by the pilot to 
effect movement. Most hydraulics-off emergencies are terminated by the pilot executing a 
running landing47 into a suitable flat area with the actual touchdown being performed at or above 
translational lift speed48 (normally 15 to 20 knots). Several suitable areas, including an airstrip, 
were available to the pilot for such a landing within 8 nautical miles (about 5 minutes flying 
time) of the accident site. As previously mentioned, the investigation revealed that the engine was operating at 
considerable power at impact Other witness marks and evidentiary findings indicate that the 
pilot’s antitorque pedals were in the full-right position (consistent with counteracting the fulltorque effects of a running engine, at low-forward airspeed, and with the rotor blades at 
maximum climb or lift pitch), and the collective lever was in the full-up position (pilot 
commanding the rotor blades into the maximum lift configuration). Ground scar evidence at the 
initial impact point clearly establishes that the helicopter was not rotating or spinning and, thus, 
was under positive pilot directional control.</div>

to an unwanted brake application was also examined. Various system failure
mode conditions were postulated and exemined as to their effect on the brake
system. It was found that under certain, albeit remote, conditions a flow
of hydraulic fluid in excess of nornal quantity could raise the pressure on
the brake supply lines, through the return system, and apply brakes. For
this situation to occur there would have to be failures to several of the
cylinders which return fluid into the brake manifold in common with the
fluid from the brake return lines. Excess pressure could then be transmitted from tne brake manifold through the return systen. Along these same lines, if a restrictor check valve in the return
system were to stick open, an abnormal pressure on the return side of the
aff«:cted check valve could block the returning pressure of the brake return
fluid and, thereby, delay the release of brakes previously applied, Similarly, if a one-way check valve in the return system to the reservoir
became blocked the resultant pressure in this line could build up and hold
the brakes on. Because nost of the hydraulic and brake system components such as
valves, accumulators, and associated plumbing were virtually destroyed in
the fire, no information could be derived concerning the system&#x27;s preimpact
condition. Therefore, from the evidence availabie no conclusions can be
estabiished as to the possible relationship between a hydraulic system
malfunction and the locked brakes,

One chronic complaint noted in the maintenance records of this
aircraft concerned a pull to the left during taxi operations. This
frequently logged complaint was tr::.ced as a nosewheel steering
discrepancy but it was not positiv.iy determined if this was, in fact,
the actual problem causing the complaint, or if it had been satisfactorily corrected. It was theorized that the pull to the left may have
been caused by a dragging brake rather than a nosewheel steering fault,
If this were the case, it would seem reasonable that the problem would
have noticeably manifested itself both through routine brake inspections
or, possibly, through slower than normal takeoff acceleration during the
course of actual line operation. However, no such docimentetion was
found in log sheets or maintenance records to substantiate this possibility
or any other theory pertaining to a brake system malfunction. (See
Appendix C.)

The maintenance records indicated that six of the eight wheels had
been changed at the company&#x27;s maintenance base in Wilmington, Delaware,
prior to the aircraft&#x27;s departure for this flight. All of the main
landing gear wheels «nd related wheel bearings were examined by the Board
for evidence of high friction forces that possibly could have impeded free
wheel rotation. All of the wheel bearings were in operational condition
and there were no unusual surface markings or discolorations to indicate
high frictional activity. Similarly, the bearing cups were in good order
and showed no evidence of secring or overheating. Under the category of an unintentional and unwanted braxe application,
consideration was given to the possitility of an inadvertent foot pressure
on the brake pedals during the takeoff by either the captain or first
officer.</div>

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] Examination of the light bulbs did not reveal
that any low fluid pressure or high fluid temperature warning lights had been lit on any of
the airplane&#x27;s three hydraulic systems. There was no evidence to indicate that either of the two engine driven
hydraulic pumps had failed. The firewall shutoff valves were found in the open position. The hydraulic fluid taken from the hydraulic systems after the erash was
contaminated by particles of rubber and other seal materials. However, examination of
the hydraulic pumps and microscopic examination of the hydraulic system warning light
bulbs disclosed no evidence of a preflight malfunction or failure of these systems. The lowest of three rudder power control units exhibited an intermittent
reduction in its no-load ‘velocity while being cycled. The no-load velocity dropped to
about one-third of the required value. The reduction was probably caused by the
contaminants in the airplane&#x27;s hydraulic fluid being lodged in the inlet slot to the main

control valye. The Safety Board believes that this condition, by itself, would not cause a
rudder control problem. The upper and middle power control units probably. would have
) been able to position the rudder to the commanded position, although the speed of
° movement would have been reduced. In addition, roll control also would have been
available to the flighterew through the operation of the ailerons. Blockage of the elevator and aileron power control units, depending on the
degree, would manifest itself to the pilot as a control jam. The flight control system
incorporates pitch disconnect and roll disconnect mechanisms which are to be used to
isolate that half of the control system which has jammed from the other half of the
system which is functioning Properly. Had the elevator or aileron flight controls
evidenced any sign of jamming, the flightcrew Probably would have activated the
appropriate disconnect mechanism in an attempt to relieve the jam. The evidence showed
that the pitch disconnect and roll disconnect mechanisms had not been activated. In
addition, the physical evidence at the impact site also showed that the airplane was in -
controlled flight when it struck the ground. Therefore, the Safety Board concludes from
the preponderance of the available evidence that there was no preimpact malfunction of
the airplane&#x27;s primary flight controls.

2.4 I Anti-Ice Systems

The position of the engine anti-ice system valves and the examination of the
annunicator light bulbs showed that the engine anti-ice system was off at impact. Examination of the wing anti-ice annunciator lights indicated that that system also was
off at impact. Since there was no reported icing in the Sun Valley area -- only a thin
overcast in the area -- and the descent was to have been made clear of clouds, the
Safety Board concludes that the wing anti-ice system was also off at impact. Further,
since both anti-ice systems were off, the airplane would have been able to attain
maximum available climb performance had it been commanded by the flighterew.</div>

The captain initially responded correctly with deflection of the rudder
pedal to the left to compensate for the loss of right engine thrust and by
lowering the nose of the aircraft; however, he appeared to be unaware of
the exact nature of the emergency. The crew response to the right engine failure was not coordinated. Neither pilot verbally identified the emergency condition or made the
emergency callouts required by FAA-approved Midwest Express
procedures. The rudder was incorrectly deflected to the right 4 to 5 seconds after
the right engine failure. An accelerated stall and loss of control occurred 10 seconds after the
failure of the right engine. Forward visual cues (outside the cockpit) were nut available to the crew
at the time that the right engine failed. Peripheral visual cues were
available. The visual flight simulator, which wes used by the crewmembers in
training, did not provide onset y-w aad longitudinal acceleration cues,
peripheral visual cues, or aural cues which were available to the crew in
the airplane. The captain and first officer misinterpreted the inside visual cues which
were presented in the airplane. The differences in visual motion and aural cues presented in the visual
flight simulator and in the airplane may have limited the ability of the
flighterew to recognize and react ar-oropriately to the emergency. Failure to recognize the nature of the emergency and improper operation
of flight controls precipitated the loss of control. The DC-9-14 does not require unusual pilot skill or strength to maintain
continued flight foliowing an engine failure on takeoff. Both crewmembers were relatively inexperienced in DC-93 flight
operations. The FAA Principal Operations Inspector who was responsible for
oversight of Midwest Express was inexperienced in FAR 121 turbojet air
carrier operations. A &quot;silent cockpit&quot; philosophy was suggested by Midwest Express in
response to certain emergency situations, although the concept was not
approved by the FAA and was in conflict with approved emergency
procedures.</div>

rudder hydraulic actuator, which controls rudder movement by hydraulic pressure or by
transferring control input to the aerodynamic tab, showed no evidence of preimpact
damage. Additionally, the rudder power shutoff vaive was found with a bent control rod
and discoloration, consistent with rudder hydraulic power on at ground impact. The Safety Board also examined the possibility that the right engine cowl was
biown open in flight or became distorted to such an extent that excessive drag was
produced, affecting controllability of the aircraft. Aithough the right engine upper
eowling was extensively damaged by impact forces, all four outboard iatches remained
latched. There was no evidence to indicate that the right cowl had opened in flight. A
recovered right cowl pieces which could be positively identified were found within the
impact area. Although a small (2- by 2-inch) piece of metal whieh resembled cowl
material was found near runway 19R, it was determined that each square foot of
deformed cowling would produce drag equivalent to a reduction of engine thrust by 160
pounds--a minor factor. Based upon the small hole (4- by 77-inch) found in the right engine
case, the absence of other case deformation (other than impact damages), and the
characteristics of typical uncontained engine pieces ejected at high velocity, the Safety
Board concludes that the cowling deformation probably was small and therefore caused
very little additional drag following the right engine failure.

2.3 Flight Control System Failure or Malfunction

The Safety Board considered the possibility of a flight control system failure
or malfunction, unrelated to the right engine failure, that might have occurred
simultaneously or nearly simultaneously with the right engine failure, and thet
subsequently led to the loss of control. The Safety Board does not believe that such a
failure or malfunction ceeurred for several reasons, ineluding those reasons cited
previously regarding possible damage caused by the ri¢ht engine failure. In addition, an
analysis of the contro! movements, which woukl have been required (commanded or
etherwise) for the airplane to have maneuvered as indicated by the FDR, revealed that:

system had failed, the functioning secondary system would have powered
the controls, Thus, the elevator control boost unit did not malfunction
because of hydraulic power loss, In addition, teardown and testing revealed there was no evidence of a preimpact malfurction nor did maintenance records indicate a history of elevator control problems, On the
basis of these findings, hydraulic system failures were discounted as a
causal. factor. Examination and testing of the engines, propellers, and their pertinent accessories and components shoved that they were operating normally
at impact. The blades of the four propellers were found on the low pitch
stop. There are three porsible explanations for this finding: (1) Extremely low airspeed at impact; (2) the engines were not operating and
the propellers were windmnilling on the low pitch stop; (3) the engines
were operating with the engine power levers pulled back to the &quot;Idle&quot;
position,

Based on witnesses&#x27; observations, the damage pattern of the propel-~
lera, and the syimmetrical blade angles at impact, the power levers must
have been retarded just before impact. This is furcher substantiated by
the fact that even at low airspeeds, the propeller blade angles should be
at 18°, or higher, at takeoff power settings. The leak found in the low-pitch stop assembly of the No. 2 propeller
indicates that this propeller could not have been placed into the reverse
position. Since the stretched filament of the associated reversing light
bulb suggests that this light was illuminated, the light was probably
triggered during the impact sequence. Since there is no physical evidence of engine problems, the vuriations in engine sounds are attributed to power ssanagement procedures or

creeping throttles. Therefore, the mechanical condition of the engines
and propellers was nvt related to the direct cause of the accident,

The consensus of the witnesses’ statements was that the aircraft
rctated abruptly to an unusually high pitch attitude and tat the short
duration level flight after takeoff was essentially flown in a similar
attitude and at a slow spead.</div>

this strike was extensive, it did not cause the failure of the vertical stabilizer. The right-hand attach stringer at PS 1185, which was
broken by the horizontal stabilizer, also fractured below that point
in the plane of the vertical stabilizer failure. This lower fracture
war tensile failure at a point where the cross-sectional area of the
stringer was approximately 1 square inch. For 7175 aluminum in this
state, a force of 80 to 100 kips would have been required to cause the
tensile failure. If the stringer had been broken above this point,
sufficient load to cause the lower failure could not have been ‘ransmitted into the angle by the surrounding structure,

Both eilerons overtraveled upward. The left aileron overtravel
is believed to have oocurreé @uring the gyrations which resulted efter
the right wing separated, since the outboard hinges were driven so rer
into the wing trailing edge. The right aileron overtravel was fairly
a, uniform and not nearly as extensive as that of the left. Thie over-

travel appears to be consistent with that which the aileron push-pull
rod might be able to cause if the rod were loaded to its structural
limtt in tension. We believe the rod was loaded to its structural
limit in tension after the initial wing failure at WS 101. No evidence was found to indicate that any in-flight fire existed
. before the wing failed. Except for the empennage area, the smaller
Se pieces of structure which separated in flight were generally unburned
. and unscoted. The only indications of in-flight fire were the soot
patterns on the right horizontal stabilizer and the heat damage on tne _
trailing edge and flap sections of the main piece of the right wing.

poe Me fact that the initisl failure cecurred in the right wing is
clearly established by the soot and fuel wash patterns on the horizontal
stabilizer. Phe stabilizer had to be in place after the integrity of
the fuel tanks was disrupted. However, a review of the wreckage scatter
pattern indicates that both the right wing failures and the empennage
failures occurred very close together in time, since parts from both
areas were found together along the eastern edge of the scatter pattern.

“4 While it was established that the initial failure occurred in the

ne . right wing, it was not as clear whether the failure began inboard or

. outboard of the engines. The nature of the rear beam damage at the
outboard fracture indicates that both an upward aileron deflection and
the previously mentioned hydraulicking of the fuel in the No. 4 tank
were present at the time of the breakup, Both of these conditions can
be explained if the inboard failure occurred first. The pull on the
aileron push-pull rod as the wing separated would result in an upward
overtravel of the right aileron.</div>

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS AND CONCLUSIONS &gt; ANALYSIS] This failure was
a result of overstress of the material and, if any prior damage did
exist, it did not contribute significantly to the failure. The lightning stroke occurred at approximately the same time that the high
maneuvering recovery loads were reaching the ultimate strength of the
wing. ‘The ball of fire occurred after the integrity of the integral
wing fuel tenks was disrupted by the failure of the wing structure. The remaining structural failures sustained by the aircraft were
either a direct consequence of the right wing failure at WS 101 or of
the descending maneuvers of the fuselage-left wing combination. The exact path of the initial fracture as it progressed through
the wing box section components is not certain because much of the
material from this area was not identified. However, enough was
identified to ascertain that this section of the wing was subjected
to positive spanwise bending overloads with some leading edge up torsion
at the time it failed. The failure probably originated as a chordwise
compression buckle of the upper surface at W5 101. The lower surface
fractures disclosed the existence of torsional loads on the wing. The
failure was primarily tensile in nature in the forward wing planks, but
the longitudinal splitting and twisting evident in the diagonal fractures
in the aft planks was indicative of torsional-shear loading. The rear beam failure probably originated at WS 141. The section
of beam between WS 101 and 141 was bent aft on both inboard and outboard
ends. These aft bends were caused by aft bending moment acting on the
beam after the continuity of the forward part of the box beam section
was interrupted. This evidence indicates the wing failed, with the wingtip and wing
leading edge moving up relative to their normal position, and with the
wingtip moving aft. ‘The initial failure occurred in the section of the
wing, which is usually critical for compressive stress in the positive
high angle of attack loading condition. Such a loading condition
normally occurs in a pullout from a dive. The torsional nature of the outboard wing front beam and lower
surface failures is not consistent with the mode of failure which would
be expected if the wing box section was intact at the time these parts
fatled, Although the diagonal rupture which existed in the lower surface
was not apparent in the upper surface, the extensive longitudinal frac-~
turing of the upper surface between WS 397 and 516 is indicative of
torsional loading at failure.

- ho -

Because of this extensive torsional deformation, we believe that
the primary failure of this section of wing occurred in the rear beam
which appears to have been pulled away from the box section. The
fracture of the rear beam at WS 397 is consistent with that type of
fracture which would be caused by aileron loads. Excessive hinge
moments applied to the WS 380 rib could cause failure of first the rib
and then the rear beam itself. The first failure in this area was
probably the separation of the upper chord from the top plank. However,
this same Loading does not appear to have been responsible for the outboard fracture where the rear beam failed primarily in tension at WS 516.</div>

probably the separation of the upper chord from the top plank. However,
this same Loading does not appear to have been responsible for the outboard fracture where the rear beam failed primarily in tension at WS 516. The fracture between the chord and the upper planks progressed inboard
from WS 515 to 448. The nature of this failure and its location seem
more suggestive of an overpressure, probably caused by fuel hydraulicking,
than of eileron overloading. This belief is further supported by the
oily soot or dirt streaks left on the right aileron by fuel flowing over
tts surface. These streaks were roughly chordwise ani were more pronounced on the inboard end and the upper surface of the aileron. The right horizontal stabilizer failed in positive bending -- &amp;
direction opposite to that in which it is usually loaded, particularly
in a positive high angle of attack condition. The sooting seen on the
exterior and interior surfaces and on the fracture surfaces of the outer
part of the stabilizer indicates clearly that this was a secondary
failure. The stabilizer was also washed by unburned fuel. This must
have occurred when the stebilizer was intact, since the flow was aligned
with the normal airflow over the surface. It is evident that the stabilizer was engulfed in burning fuel which was ignited sometime after
the wing fuel tanks ruptured. The enount of soot inside the outer
section leads us to conclude that raw fuel was ingested by the fractured
end of the stabilizer and this fuel burned as the part fell, The source
of the loading which failed this surface was probably inertial forces
generated by the rapid roll of the aircraft immediately following wing
separation, Another source of loading which may have contributed to
the failure was an up airload caused by the loss of downwash, normally
generated by the wing, after the wing had separated. The left stabilizer did not fail but separated intact, taking its
fuselage attach structure with it. ‘The source of loading in this case
was probably the asymaetric tail load on the fuselage which resulted
after the separation of the right stabilizer. The vertical stabilizer, which separated to the left, also appears
to have failed as a result of inertial loads. This stabilizer was
struck by the leading edge of the right horizontal stabilizer, leaving
red paint marks on the leading cdge of the horizontal stabilizer from
the lettering on the vertical stabilizer. Although the damage caused by

utter. The separation of the horizontal stabilizer was caused by an abnormal
asym metrical afr load on the stabilizer. Structural failure was preceded by some other failure or malfunction of
the airplane&#x27;s elevator control system. The aft fracture of the left elevator control rod was due to compression
buekling at or near the midpoint. The aft fracture of the left elevator control rud occurred before the
elevator separated from the stabilizer. The elevator control rod failed in compression buckling with an applied
load of about 466 pounds. The elevator control rod would fracture at its midpoint when the load is

applied through the rod end bearings, as ii would be applied in the norma]
‘light through pilot input. A combination of commanded aircraft hose up pitch attitude and nose
down trim tab deflection results in compression forces in both the left

and the right control rods, with the force in the left rod being the
greatest. The control column pull force required to cause a compression fallure of
the left elevator control rod would approach or exceed the maximum

two-hand pull force of about 20% pounds, which can be applied by one
male pilot of average strength. The trim tab actuator Indicated full trailing edge up trim tab deflection
(airplane nose down).

The separation of the elevator tips from the elevators and the elevators
from the stabilizer occurred during or immediately after the horizontal
Stabilizer attachment failed and as a result of inertial and aerodynamic

loads which were imposed on the stabilizer and elevator assembly during
its separation from the fuselage. The left elevator trim tab requires about 30 seconds to travel from an
approximately neutral takeoff trim position to the full trailing edge up
position.</div>

2.6 Preexisting Condition of Airplane Structure

The investigation determined that before takeoff there was no Gamage t¢
either the stabilizer or to the elevator components sufficient to suggest a preflight a
collision between the airplane and another vehicle, such as a fuel truck or baggage cart. .
Further, those persons who observed and serviced the airplane during its Jacksonville turn *
around did not see any vehicle come in contact with the airplane. No baggage cart was Euse, Therefore, the Safety Board concludes that the airplane was not subjected ta
external loads of sufficient magnitude to produce a deformation or failure of the

stabilizer attachment structure during « preflight collision, such as contact with a ground
vehicle. The Safety Board determined that the fractures of the male lugs of the i
forward attachment fitting at buikhead No. 33 eaused the horizontal stabilizer assembly a
to separate from the fuselage. The deformation and fractures of the attachment fitting a
indicate that the male lugs fractured first in shear and then in tensile overstress as the c
horizontal stabilizer moved aft and twisted clockwise (looking forward) relating to the Sy
fuselage, Because the loads on the forward attachment fitting are carried into the a
fuselage monocoque structure by rivets and channels at bulkhead No. 33, and because =
there was evidence of preexisti damage in (sis area, the effects of such preexisting Ei
damage on the load carrving capability of this stcueture were analyzed in depth. Z

The fretting around some of the fastener holes in the channels which transmit ia
the loads from the upper right corner of the forward attachment fitting into the fuselage
forward of bulkhead No. 33 indicated that some fasteners had been loose before the fina)
structural failure. Looseness in these attachments would have resulted in a transfer of
inereasad stabilizer loads into the bulkhead No. 33 web. The small pre-existing fatigue

erack ($/16-ineh long) in the bulkhead web supported the contention that loose or sheared 4a
rivets had bewn present before the accident and that the web hud »een exposed to excess E
stress, I

I The susceptibility of the EMB-110P1 and P2 models to fastener distress and
web fatigue cracking in the bulkhead No. 33 structure was known before the accident. ‘”
The knowledge had prompted the manufacturer to issue a service bulletin which described f
an inspection program to deteet loose fasteners and web fatigue cracks. The service
bulletin also described an alternative modification to correct the loose fasteners and a
procedure t. repair the web cracks.</div>

peas to nme aa! The consultant&#x27;s analysis of flutter characteristics of the empennage
considered a reduction in stiffness attributable to loose rivets at bulkhead No. 3., a
completely separated elevator hinge, the actual balance weight distribution of N96PB, and
a broken elevator control rod. The analysis showed that the airplane would not have
encountered an aerodynamic flutter condition in the speed range between 50 and 200
knots. Therefore, the Safety Bow&#x27;d concludes that the structural failure was not caused
by a divergent aerodynamie flutter. Although analys?s and tests showed that the existence of loose or sheared
fastenets in the bulkhead No. 33 structure of W96PB did not affect the ability of the
structure to withstand applied static loads or the airplane&#x27;s aeroelastic characteristics,
the Safety Board remains concer-ed that this condition on other EMB-110P1 and P2
airplanes could lead to progressive fatigue and premature structure failure. The Safety
Beard believes that the FAA should require the horizontal stabilizer attachment structure
of EMB-110P1 and P2 airplanes be modified to preclude such damage in accordance with a
procedure set forth by the manufacturer. The Safety Board agrees that the tests showed
that the stabilizer forward attachment structure at bulkhead No. 33 would carry ultimate
stabilizer loads even though weakened by cracks and the removal of fasteners in the
bulkhead web. Nevertheless, the Safety Board is concerned that the tests were not
sufficient tu show conclusively whether the resulting change in load distribution would
affect the fatigue life of the redundatit load path.

2.8 Vibratory Load Considerations

The missing part of one blade of the right propeller prompted concern that the
blade might have been damaged before or during takeoff and that 4 resultant imbalance
might have caused structural failure of the horizontal stabilizer. The damage to the other
blades of the right propeller and to the blades of the left propeller were not typical of

damage which would be expected from a takeoff ground strike. Further, the end of that

portion of the blade on the right propeller which remained attached to the hub had melted
and sagged under its own weight during exposure to the posterash fire. Therefore, the
Safety Board believes that the missing portion of the blade was consumed in the ground
fire. Moreover, the manufacturer&#x27;s tests in which the horizontal stabilizer and elevator
structures v..~¢ instrumented to measure the vibration loads caused by propeller
imbalance disclosed that high loads sufficient to damage the elevators, could be produced
only with a 14-inch or longer length of one propeller blade missing. However, the
manufacturer stated that a propeller imbalance of this magnitude also would cause
destruction of the engine mounting structure.</div>

engine separated early in the breakup sequence when the left wing failed. The -
failure of the left wing released fuel that probably led to the in-flight fire. The passenger seat that was ejected from the cabin at ground impact
suggests that the fire did not progress into the cabin area before impact. This I
conclusion is supported by the absence of soot deposits in the respiratory tract of
the occupants, and the absence of elevated carboxyhemoglobin in the tissues of the
occupants.

. The FDR data and examination of the wreckage revealed that the
flight control systems, engines, and propellers were operating normally before the
extreme attitude changes of the airplane. Consequently, engine and propeller
malfunctions were not a factor in the accident. .

The Safety Board&#x27;s analysis of this accident included an examination
of the circumstances that led to the loss of the left stabilizer leading edge,
including: flightcrew performance related to the accident; the maintenance and
inspection conducted by Continental Express the night before the accident; the
management of the Continental Express maintenance department; the FAA

34

approval and oversight of the Continental Express maintenance program; and the
procedures for establishing RIIs by the aircraft manufacturer, the airline, and the
FAA. The Safety Board’ s analysis also examined the aerodynamic and .
structural failure aspects related to the dynamics of the airplane after it lost the left
stabilizer leading edge.

2.2 Aerodynamic and Structural Failure Aspects

The Safety Board believes that the airplane experienced the following
sequence of events during the final moments of flight. The airplane was
descending at 260 KIAS, which was well within its operating envelope, the wings
were level, both engines were operating normally, and the pitch attitude was
10 degrees nose down. As the airplane descended through 11,500 feet, the leading
edge of the left horizontal stabilizer separated from the airframe. The left
horizontal stabilizer leading edge was the first piece of wreckage found along the
wreckage path, preceding the next piece by almost 1/2 mile. This indicates that it
_ was the first piece to separate from the airplane. The loss of the leading edge
exposed the front spar of the left side of the horizontal stabilizer to the airstream,
and an aerodynamic stall occurred that greatly reduced the downforce produced by
the horizontal stabilizer. The reduction in downforce created a large nose-down
pitching moment, and the airplane pitched down immediately. A peak load factor
of approximately -5 g was reached at the end of only 1 second. The airframe remained intact (minus the leading edge), and the load
factor fluctuated around -2 g, for approximately 6 1/2 seconds. The. airplane pitch
attitude decreased to 68 degrees nose down, airplane heading moved 20 degrees
nose left, and a 15 degree right roll attitude was reached at the end of this period. The airplane&#x27;s altitude was 9,500 feet, and it was flying at an airspeed of
280 KIAS.</div>

attitude decreased to 68 degrees nose down, airplane heading moved 20 degrees
nose left, and a 15 degree right roll attitude was reached at the end of this period. The airplane&#x27;s altitude was 9,500 feet, and it was flying at an airspeed of
280 KIAS. A second peak in negative load factor was then experienced, and the
Safety Board believes that the left wing failed and the right wing tip detached at _
this point. The airplane then rolled to the right at a roll rate exceeding
160 degrees per second. The Safety Board believes that the lift produced by the
intact right wing produced the extreme roll. The high airspeed and roll rate created
large airloads on the airplane&#x27;s structure. The Safety Board believes: that excessive —
airloads induced by the high airspeeds and/or roll rate caused the horizontal
stabilizer and left engine to separate from the airframe. The airplane then entered a

35

spin to the right, fell uncontrollably toward impact, its pitch attitude oscillating
between approximately -40 degrees and +40 degrees. To recreate this sequence, the Safety Board relied on the substantial
amount of evidence obtained from the wreckage, CVR, and FDR. Flight dynamics
and structural simulations by Embraer provided additional data for use in the
investigation. The Safety Board analyzed the airloads that were applied to the
partially secured leading edge on the accident airplane. The atmosphere was calm;
therefore, gust loads were probably not a factor in the separation of the leading
edge. Aerodynamic lift and drag both produce loads on the horizontal stabilizer
structure. In general, aerodynamic loads are significantly greater at higher
airspeeds since the dynamic pressure of the airstream varies directly with the
square of airplane velocity. Aerodynamic drag exerts a force on the airplane that is opposite to the
direction of motion and parallel to the relative wind. Therefore, aerodynamic drag
created an aft load on the horizontal stabilizer structure of the accident airplane. This force compressed the partially secured leading edge against the front spar of
the stabilizer structure and helped to keep the leading edge in place. However,
aerodynamic lift is also an important factor in the determination of airloads acting
on the stabilizer. The horizontal stabilizer in this case provides negative, or downward,
lift to balance the pitching moment of the wings, engines, and fuselage. Airplane
nose pitch attitude is controlled up or down by deflecting the elevator attached to .
the rear of the horizontal stabilizer. The lift force required at the horizontal
stabilizer to establish trimmed flight is a function of many factors, such as the
center of gravity, engine thrust, airspeed, and airplane configuration. The airplane
is described as being &quot;trimmed&quot; in pitch if the sum of the pitching moments created
by these factors is equal to zero. Calculations that defined the horizontal stabilizer
lift required (downward) for the two postmaintenance flights on N33701 showed
that the peak download occurred at the time of the accident flight upset.</div>

Analysis
2.1
General
The captain and the first officer were properly certificated and qualified under 
Federal regulations. No evidence indicated any medical or behavioral conditions that 
might have adversely affected their performance during the accident flight. There was no 
evidence of flight crew fatigue. The accident airplane was certificated and equipped in accordance with Federal 
regulations. The recovered components showed no evidence of any system or powerplant 
failures but showed evidence of multiple failures of wing structural components. The fire damage to the fuselage and empennage was a result of the failure of the 
right wing and the subsequent breach in the wing fuel tank. The accident was not 
survivable. The emergency response was timely. This analysis discusses the in-flight separation of the accident airplane’s right 
wing, Chalk’s Ocean Airways’ maintenance of the accident airplane and other airplanes in 
its fleet, the FAA’s oversight of the Chalk’s Ocean Airways maintenance program, and 
certification issues pertaining to aging aircraft.
2.2
In-flight Breakup Sequence
On the basis of the accident airplane’s takeoff weight and airspeed, the wing 
structure developed normal aerodynamic loads during takeoff, and these loads, in turn, 
created normal internal loads. However, the right wing separated from the airplane at 
WS 34 while the airplane was operated within its certificated design envelope, rendering 
the airplane uncontrollable. The airplane departed on the accident flight with preexisting 
damage to some wing structural components, however, the damaged components were not 
visible to the flight crew. The Safety Board concludes that there was no evidence from the 
performance or appearance of the airplane that would have provided warning to the flight 
crew of the right wing’s imminent failure and that there was nothing that the crew could 
have done to regain control of the airplane after the in-flight separation of the right wing. Section 2.2.1 discusses the fracture scenario and the right wing’s structural performance.
2.2.1 Fracture Scenario
Examination of the right wing revealed preexisting fatigue fractures and cracks in 
the rear Z-stringer, lower skin, and rear spar lower spar cap, each of which contributed to 
reducing the wing structure’s ability to carry load. An analysis of each component’s 
fracture characteristics, rub evidence and other characteristics observed on some Analysis

components and on some maintenance repairs, and evaluation of the typical load-bearing 
characteristics of the wing structure design were performed to produce a general timeline 
and likely sequence for the respective failure of each fractured component. Section 2.3 
discusses the importance of this sequence as it relates to opportunities for repairing each 
damaged component before they cumulatively resulted in wing failure. The analysis revealed that the airplane’s right rear Z-stringer (as shown in figure 5) 
likely fractured first. Several features indicated that the right rear Z-stringer had been 
fractured for some time, most likely years, before the accident.71 Fatigue initiated at the 
slosh hole in the web of the Z-stringer just outboard of right WS 34.</div>

over months and years, company maintenance and inspection personnel had multiple 
opportunities to identify and correct the individual damaged components and, thus, could 
have prevented the wing failure. 
2.3.1 Ineffective Repairs on the Accident Airplane 
Although maintenance personnel detected some problems and attempted repairs, 
many of the repairs were ineffective in that they did not properly restore the load-carrying 
capability of the wing structure. Ineffective repairs observed on the accident airplane 
included documented repairs performed by company maintenance personnel and some 
undocumented repairs. Also, company inspection personnel failed to identify that the 
repairs were ineffective. The ineffective repairs observed on the accident airplane included 
the following:
•
Sanding marks were observed around the rear Z-stringer slosh hole and 
fracture lips at right WS 34, suggesting that the sanding was an attempt to 
remove cracking that had been detected in the Z-stringer. The cracking, 
however, was not completely removed, and the crack continued to propagate 
over time.
•
One of the three internal doublers at right WS 34 had a portion that covered the 
lower flange of the rear Z-stringer, suggesting that the portion of the doubler 
covering the Z-stringer was an attempt to reinforce the fractured Z-stringer. Doubling only the lower flange did not restore the strength of the fractured 
Z-stringer.
•
Multiple-site fatigue damage at the inboard fastener row for the doublers at 
right WS 34 linked up in the area of the rear Z-stringer before the wing 
separated, indicating that repairs in this area did not restore the strength of the 
rear Z-stringer. Analysis
41
Aircraft Accident Report
•
Several fasteners in the inboard row of fasteners for the doubler repair at right 
WS 34 were inserted through sealant near the fuel sump drain instead of the 
lower skin.77 This resulted in ineffective load transfer between the skin and the 
doublers in that area.
•
Three stop drill holes were located in the area of the doubler repair to the lower 
skin at right WS 34. The stop drill holes showed that the skin crack was 
detected at least three times before the doublers were applied and that the crack 
had extended twice from the location of a previous stop drill hole. Continued 
crack growth from a stop drill hole is indicative of an underlying structural 
problem that was not properly addressed in previous maintenance actions.</div>

any adverse inflight handiing characteristics and/or structural loads. There was no distress call received from N100UV, which indicates that some
emergency condition occurred suddenly and fully engrossed the pilot&#x27;s attention.

2.2 Aircraft Breakup

Witnesses saw the aircraft fall from a cloud. They also saw that both wings
and the tail were missing from the aircraft before it struck the ground,

The wreckage distribution revealed that the fairly compact scatter path was
about 1,150 feet wide (north to south) and 1,600 feet long (east to west). With a surface
wind of 10 knots from the west, some components could have been subjected to wind drift. The inflight breakup probably occurred somewhere between the time the aircraft was at
its assigned cruise altitude of 8,000 feet and when it was seen coming out of the cloud
before ground impact. Taking into consideration that the breakup occurred at altitude,
the wind drift of the components, and the relatively confined scatter path, the Safety
Board concludes that the separation of the aircraft components -- horizontsi and vertical
stabilizers, elevators, rudder, and wings -- occurred, in sequence, within a few seconds. The sequence of the separation was established by the mode of separation. The horizontal stabilizers probably received an excessive downward loading force, as

evidenced by the downward spanwise bending deformation on both stabilizers. The source

f this loading was most likely e nose-up control input initiated by the pilot at high speed.

s the elevator deflected upward in response to the nose-up control input, the center of

pressure acting on the horizontal stabilizers would travel aft, creating &amp; Jeading edge up
twisting moment. It was under this loading that the stabilizers failed and separated. The horizontal stabilizers separated in an upward direction as evidenced by the
black rubber smear marks across both sides of the vertical fin. The marks were made by
the horizontal stabilizer deicer boots. Since both horizontal stabilizers appeared to have
failed simultaneously and separated in a sym metrical manner, the aircraft wings were
intact before the horizontal stabilizer failuce. If a wing hac failed first, the resultant
rolling forces created by the unsymmetrical aerodynamic condition, would make a
syminetrical failure and separation of the stabilizers unlikely. Upon failure and separation of the horizontal stabilizer, the normal flight
downward force acting on the aircraft tall would be released which wold allow the
aircraft to pitch nose down violently, At that point, the aircraft was beyond controllable
flight and the continued inflight breakup and failures of the aircraft structure should be
considered secondary. Although the flight control surfaces were examined during the on-scene
investigation for evidence of possible flutter, further examination and testing of the
control surfaces was conducted after it was learned that the aircraft had been repainted

~13-

and the control surfaces had not been balanced after being repainted. Close examination
of the control surfaces showed areas where the skin surface had deen stripped and
repainted without the control surface being removed from the aircraft.</div>

The pilots of N811BE were qualified in the airplane in accordance with
FARs and company policies. Although neither autopsies nor post mortem
toxicological tests could be performed because the bodies of the pilots were not
recovered, there was no independent evidence of medical or physiological
problems that might have adversely affected their performance. Further, the CVR
conversations between the pilots suggest that neither had any physical problems
that might have affected their control of the airplane. The Safety Board concludes that there is no evidence to indicate that the
airplane was not airworthy or that structural failures, or systems defects or
malfunctions, precipitated control difficulties. All critical structural failures
observed were caused by overloads associated with forceful impact with the
surface of the ocean. Although the evidence was not conclusive with regard to when the outboard
section of the right wing separated from the airplane, the Safety Board believes
that the wing was intact when the airplane crashed into the ocean. The
postaccident drift analysis placed the wing section in the wreckage area when the

20

accident occurred. Metallurgical examination disclosed that there were no defects
in the structural components of the wing in the area of separation and_ that
separation occurred from overstress. Based on the airptane’s last transponder-reported position and altitude, the
airplane performance study disclosed that the airplane could have descended to the
wreckage location within the 15 seconds that elapsed between the last altitude alert
recorded on the CVR and the end of the recording. Further, the descent could
have occurred without exceeding performance limitations in terms of airspeed and
acceleration loads that could have caused major structural failures. Moreover, the
descent could have occurred without acceleration loads that would have made intra
cockpit conversation difficult--as noted before, the pilots’ conversation was not
abnormal throughout the descent and the IP continued to discuss unusual attitude
recovery actions with the captain-irainee almost until the end of the recording. The Safety Board cannot conclusively exclude the possibility of an event that
caused premature termination of CVR operation before the airplane struck the
water because the CVR events could not be precisely coordinated with the position
and altitude as recorded by ATC radar, nor was there any FDR information
available to establish the airplane’s actual performance during its final descent. However, throughout the approximate 32-minute CVR transcript there was no
mention by any of the pilots of any airplane systems problems, engine problems,
or instrument problems, other than those created by the IP. Therefore, considering
all of the evidence, the Board believes that any event that would have caused
termination of the CVR must have been sudden and probably catastrophic, which
leads to the conclusion that the event was a high speed coilision with the surface
of the ocean.</div>

human error. As previously discussed, this investigation has identified several weaknesses
in the lubrication and inspection procedures that could affect their intended results and
compromise safety.272 Further, several Safety Board accident investigations, including the
Alaska Airlines flight 261 investigation, have demonstrated that even simple maintenance
tasks are sometimes missed or inadequately performed and can have catastrophic
results.273 Therefore, the current horizontal stabilizer trim system design remains

273 For example, following the September 11, 1991, crash of a Continental Express Embraer 120 in Eagle
Lake, Texas, the Safety Board concluded that the airline’s maintenance inspection and quality assurance
programs failed to detect that the upper row of screws on the leading edge of the left horizontal stabilizer had
been removed during maintenance and had not been replaced. The partially secured left horizontal stabilizer
leading edge separated in flight, causing a severe nose-down pitchover. The airplane broke up in flight, and
all 14 people on board were killed. For more information, see National Transportation Safety Board. Britt

July 6, 1996, uncontained engine failure on a Delta Air Lines MD-88 in Pensacola, Florida, determined that
a fluorescent inspection process used to detect fatigue cracks during maintenance was susceptible to error
because it involved multiple cleaning, processing, and inspection procedures dependent on several
individuals and because of a low expectation of finding a crack. Shrapnel from the uncontained engine
failure pierced the fuselage and entered the rear cabin. Two passengers were killed, and two others were
seriously injured. For more information, see National Transportation Safety Board. Uncontained Engine

loud noise recorded on the CVR at 1619:36.6 was likely made as the fairing brackets
failed and caused the loss of the tip fairing and structural deformation of the tail under
flight loads, resulting in local aerodynamic disturbances.223
Valid airplane performance data do not exist for horizontal stabilizer positions
beyond 14º airplane nose down. Although the exact horizontal stabilizer angle required to
produce the final pitchover could not be determined, the Safety Board’s airplane
performance studies determined that the airplane’s pitch rate during the final dive could
only have resulted from a rapid increase to a stabilizer angle significantly beyond
14º airplane nose down.224 
In sum, the Safety Board concludes that the cause of the final dive was the
low-cycle fatigue fracture of the torque tube, followed by the failure of the vertical
stabilizer tip fairing brackets, which allowed the horizontal stabilizer leading edge to
move upward significantly beyond what is permitted by a normally operating jackscrew
assembly. The resulting upward movement of the horizontal stabilizer leading edge
created an excessive upward aerodynamic tail load, which caused an uncontrollable
downward pitching of the airplane from which recovery was not possible.
2.2.5 Flight Crew Decision-Making
2.2.5.1 Decision to Continue Flying Rather than Return to PVR 
Safety Board investigators considered several reasons that might explain the
captain’s decision not to return immediately to PVR after he experienced problems with
the horizontal stabilizer trim system during the climbout from PVR. Neither the Alaska Airlines MD-80 Quick Reference Handbook (QRH) Stabilizer
Inoperative checklist nor the company’s QRH Runaway Stabilizer emergency checklist
required landing at the nearest suitable airport if corrective actions were not successful. These checklist procedures were the only stabilizer-related checklist procedures contained
in the QRH, and the flight crew most likely followed these checklist procedures in their
initial attempts to correct the airplane’s jammed stabilizer. 
222 The Safety Board notes that the fairing brackets were not intended to carry the load of the horizontal
stabilizer.
223 As discussed in section 1.11.1.1, sound tests indicated that neither this sound nor any of the other
sounds recorded by the accident airplane’s CVR were similar to sounds associated with the failure of the
torque tube. The investigation could not determine exactly what caused the sound. 
224 Structural analysis indicated that the horizontal stabilizer must travel to a position of greater than
15º airplane nose down to allow the acme screw to completely exit the top of the acme nut, as it did during
the final dive. Symmetrical structural damage was found on the tail, indicating that the horizontal stabilizer’s
hinge fittings contacted the vertical stabilizer’s rear spar, which would occur at a horizontal stabilizer
position of 16.2º airplane nose down. Analysis

scenarios using vertical stabilizer structural models, conducted three postaccident static
lug tests, and evaluated certification documents. No deviations from the original design and materials specifications were found in
the vertical stabilizer (including the repair to the left center lug area that was made during
manufacturing) that would have contributed to the vertical stabilizer separation. Also, a
detailed inspection of flight 587’s wreckage, including an extensive examination of the
vertical stabilizer main attachment fitting fractures, revealed that each main attachment
fitting had features that were consistent with overstress fracture and exhibited no evidence
of fatigue features or other preexisting degradation. Fracture features and damage patterns
on the right forward, center, and rear lugs were consistent with overstress failure under
tensile loading. The right rear lug, in particular, had fracture features that were consistent
with failure in the cleavage-tension mode. Fracture features and damage patterns on the
left forward, center, and rear lugs had features that were consistent with the vertical
stabilizer bending to the left after separation of the lugs on the right side. Safety Board investigators conducted an airplane performance study to describe
the motion of the accident airplane, identify the causes of the motion, and calculate the
resulting aerodynamic loading on the vertical stabilizer.177 The airplane performance study
revealed that the first officer’s cyclic rudder pedal inputs, which began about 7 seconds
before the vertical stabilizer separation, led to increasing sideslip angles that, along with
the continued rudder deflections, produced extremely high aerodynamic loads on the
vertical stabilizer.</div>

Aircraft Accident Report 2.
Analysis
2.1
General
The captain and the first officer (the flying pilot) were properly certificated and
qualified under Federal regulations. No evidence indicates any preexisting medical
conditions that may have adversely affected the flight crew’s performance during the
flight. Flight crew fatigue was not a factor in this accident. The accident airplane was properly maintained and dispatched in accordance with
Federal regulations. Before takeoff, the number 2 pitch trim and yaw damper system
would not engage. American Airlines avionics technicians found a fault with the number 2
flight augmentation computer, and the fault cleared when the circuit breaker for this
computer was reset. The air traffic controllers who handled American Airlines flight 587 were properly
trained and qualified. The local controller complied with Federal Aviation Administration
(FAA) wake turbulence spacing requirements when handling flight 587 and Japan Air
Lines flight 47, which departed immediately before flight 587. Flight 587’s vertical stabilizer and rudder separated from the fuselage before
impact and were recovered separately about 1 mile before the main wreckage site. At
0915:58.5, the flight data recorder (FDR) recorded a 0.2 G lateral acceleration, which
corresponded to the sound of a loud bang recorded by the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) at
the same time. The Safety Board’s airplane performance study indicated that this change
in lateral acceleration and the ensuing out-of-control airplane motion resulted from the
separation of the vertical stabilizer from the fuselage. In addition, the study showed that,
before vertical stabilizer separation, the airplane responded properly to all rudder
deflections and that the rudder remained properly attached until the vertical stabilizer
broke off the fuselage. (The vertical stabilizer separation is discussed further in
section 2.2.)
Both engines separated from the airplane before ground impact. Neither engine
showed evidence of uncontainments, case ruptures, or preimpact failure, and engine
operation was normal throughout the airplane’s ground operations, takeoff, and initial
climb. FDR and CVR data showed that engine separation occurred during the
out-of-control airplane motion that followed the separation of the vertical stabilizer. Fuel
may have been ignited during the engine separation and may have caused a flash fire. Also, during the airplane’s descent, the out-of-control motion would have disrupted the
airflow into the engines and likely caused engine compressor surges. (Visible flames
emanating from the engines are typical during engine compressor surges.) Therefore, the Analysis
134
Aircraft Accident Report
Safety Board concludes that the witnesses who reported observing the airplane on fire174
were most likely observing a fire from the initial release of fuel or the effects of engine
compressor surges. Shortly after takeoff, flight 587 encountered wake turbulence from Japan Air Lines
flight 47—first at 0915:36 and again at 0915:51.</div>

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS AND CONCLUSIONS] It is the opinion of the Board that tite cause
of the wing separation muse be attributed to
the preexisting fatigue crack in the right-hand
CPH-2004 fitting. The initiating sous for this
fatigue was a sinall pit formed by fretting
between the wing attaciy bolt and the wall of
the attach bolt hole. The fretting was, in turn,
likely caused by localized high bearing stresses
at the upper aft and lower foavard walls of the
bolt hole. After if had examined the cause of the wing
separation, the Board then directed its efforts

toward determining the underlying factors
which permitted this fatigue failure. The results
of that phase of the investigation led back to
the modification of the aircraft from a stardard Dove to the Von Carstedt Model
104-7AXC. In reviewing the design of this modifcation
the Board noted two errors which affected the
fatigue life and load-carrying capability of the
CPD-2004 fitting. One of these was, the failure
to transfer information regarding dimensional
tolerances from the design data to the engineceing drawing from which the parts were
manufactured. This omission seems particularly
significant to the Board in view of the known
premature failure of the DeHavilland fatigue
test specimen, and that company’s finding tnt
the failure was related .o bolt clearances. Although deformation of the failed fitting in
the accident aircraft precluded the determina-
‘tion of the actual diameter of the hole, the
hole tolecance callout on the engineering draw:
ing was considerably larger than that specified
in the fatigue data. Excessive clearances could
have caused high bearing stresses at the hole
wall. The Board, therefore, concludes that this
increase in «‘varanc’ may have contributed to
the iniciacion of the fracture. The other ercor was the selection of an alloy
stecl (4130) that did not hardin uniformly in
the various sections of the fitting when the part
was heat treated. This resuited in a fitting
which had a lower average tensile strength than
the value used in the stress analysis. The Board
believes that this lower strength may also have
contributed to the premature failure of the
fitting. In addition to the influence of the design
etrors on the cause of this accident, other
facets of the certification prograia must be
considered significant. For example, both of
the errors discussed might have been detected
if the DER&#x27;s had properly reviewed the design
data and engineering drawings which they, in

effect approved by affixing their signatures or
initials thereto. However, the Board noted that
the DER’s involved were not fully aware of the
responsibilities associated with that position. Also, the crroncous heat treatment callout on
the design drawing might well have been
detected by the Manufacturing Inspector if he
had followed up on his rejection of the entire
lot ip which tne fitting was heat treated.</div>

after shutdown of the engine and extinguishing of the engine fire.

&quot;During the return to the airport, the flightcrew experienced
difficulty in extending the landing gear and the wing flaps after
parts of the feiled engine severed the hydraulic and pneumatic
systems&#x27; supply lines. The captain elected to &quot;go around&quot; and
extended the landing gear by the alternate system. The aircraft
made a successful landing, and there were no injuries tc the 15
crewnembers or the 127 passengers.

“Our preliminary investigation of the engine failure revealed
that a separation occurred to the rim portion of the second-stage
turbine disk. It has been confirmed that failures of at least four
of seven first-stage turbine slades contributed to the fracture of
nunerous second-stage turbine vane fect. As a result of the
cumulative effect of the broken vane feet, an aft deflection of
the nozzle support resulted, causing interference with and rubbing
of the second-stage turbine disk. Progressive weakening of the
disk rim area resulted in the in-flight failure of the rim. We have
also confirmed that although failure mode of this second-stage
turbine disk rim was similar to that of the Air France JT9D-3A engine
failure of August 17, 1976. the failure mechanism was entircly
different.

“As a result of our investigation and meeting with Pratt &amp;
Whitney engineering staf® personnel and your Eastern Region Flight
Standards personnel, immediate inspection action was initiated. This was considered fully responsive to the immediate needs of this
situation. The Safety Board commends the Administrator&#x27;s formalizing
this corrective action in the form of your engineering alerts of
September 19 and 23, 1970.

&quot;In view of the potentially catastrophic results of the failure
such as experienced by American Airlines, the Board remains concerned
about this matter in the longer range sense and would urge the
Administrator to initiate further expeditious actions in order to
preclude recurrence of similar failures. Accordingly, the Board
offers the following observations.

&quot;It is generally recognized that the JTQD engine is normelly
operating near critical turbine temperature conditions. This is
particularly crue when operating in high ambient temperatures. Several JTQ9D engines have recently been removed from service and
returned to Pratt &amp; Whitney for overhaul, because cf failed firststage turbine blades as well as broken second-stage vane feet. There is evidence that these failures had occurred as the result
of operation at higher-than-desirable temperatures.

&quot;In the case of the most recent American Airlines turbine
disk rim separation, there was evidence that at least six firststage turbine blades had sustained varying degrees of fractures
some time prior to the final failure. Our technical staff finds
it most difficult to reconcile the fact that the airborne vibration
monitoring equipment installed in the aircraft was either inadequate
or was not effectively utilized in detecting this condition.</div>

temperatures and therefore requires most precise monitoring
of all vital operating parameters and effective analysis of
any confirmed deviations from normal parameters,

Vibratory stresses in exzess of four times their normal
level were imposed upon the second-stage vane feet after
stress rupture of first-stage turbine blades. Multiple failures of second-stage vane feet and resultant
rearvard shift of the nozzle inner support caused rubbing
of the support against the second-stage turbine disk until
separation of the disk rim occurred,

Deterioration of vital engine operating parameters was
evident on both the narrative portion of the flight log

and the computerized engine condition monitor log. Maintenance actions taxen by the carrier in attempting to
correct the in-flight discrepancies as reported on the
No. 1 engine were not responsive to the problem that existed. While the computerized engine monitor log used by the carrier
was effective in accurately identifying the progressive
decrease of N2 and increase in EGT and fuel flow, the data
was not available for use in time to effect corrective action
prior to severe engine failure,

The fire which resulted from the turbine failure was terminated by the immediate response of the flightcrew in sucecssfully shutting off fuel supply to the No. 1 pylon. The fire
extinguishing agent appeared to have little effect in conbating the fira. The results of the primary failure affected other systems
critical to the landing phase and compounded the already
existing emergency by placing an additional burden upon the
flightcrevw. PROBABLE CAUSE

Tne National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable
caus: of this incident was e progressive faflure in the high-pressure turbine sodule in the No. 1 JTYD-3\ engine. This failure was initiated by
the undetected stress rupture fractures of several first-stage turbine
blades and culminated in in-flight separation of the second-stage turbiuie
disk rim.

-lRECOMMENDATIONS AND CORRECTIVE ACTION

On September 25, 1970, the Board sent the following letter to the
Adninistretor of the Federal Aviation Administration:

“The National Transportation Safety Board is now investigating
the JT9D-3 engine failure and in-flight fire involving American
Airlines, Boeing 747, N743PA, which occurred during takeoff from
the San Franetsco International Airport on Septemher 18, 1970. A
failure occurred in the No. ] engine 13 seconds after lift-off,
followed by a fire warning. The flight returned to the airport
after shutdown of the engine and extinguishing of the engine fire.

&quot;During the return to the airport, the flightcrew experienced

&quot;In the case of the most recent American Airlines turbine
disk rim separation, there was evidence that at least six firststage turbine blades had sustained varying degrees of fractures
some time prior to the final failure. Our technical staff finds
it most difficult to reconcile the fact that the airborne vibration
monitoring equipment installed in the aircraft was either inadequate
or was not effectively utilized in detecting this condition. We
&amp;lso feel that other engine instrumentation, namely: fuel flow,
engine pressure ratio, and exhaust gas temperature should have been
capable of collectively reflecting appropriate changes in the
engine&#x27;s operating parameters, if such instrumentation were properly
calibrated and the respective readings were recorded and closely
analyzed,

&quot;In this area, we recommend the following be ccnsidered,

1, Initiate appropriate action toward the operators’
maintaining a program of current engine condition
monitoring. Review engine instrumentation calibration and
existing instrument tolerances to assure the most
precise engine operating parameter indications.

&quot;Further, it appears that the reliability of the Boeing 747
auxiliary power units is somewhat marginal. When engine starts
must be accomplished by the use of ground units, pneunatic duct
- pressures may often be less than what is required, even when
multiple units are used, The result is usually a start that may
involve a temperature rise, approaching the “recoverable stall”
condition. Since exhaust gas temperature, although above normal
under these conditions often do not exceed the published limits,
no record is made of these occurrences, and there is no possible
way to determine how many times an engine hot section has been
exposed to higher-than-normal temperatures, The effects of thermal
transients are known to be cumulative and conceivably affect turbine
vlade reliability.

~-19-

&quot;As another measure toward improving the service reliability
of first-stage turbine blades, it is recommended that appropriate
action be initiated to:

1. Improve the reliability of auxillary power units in
order to reduce the probability of high thermal
transients while starting engines with marginal air
supply. Ensure that flightcrews maintain adequate pneumatic
air duct pressure during engine starts. Record any abnormal starts when an approach to 4
“recoverable stall&quot; is experienced. Establish precise limitations regarding the number
of &quot;approaches to recoverable stall&quot; conditions
which may be tolerated without cumulative adverse
effects upon turbine blade durability.

&quot;The Safety Board is aware that the manufacturer has developed
an improved type first-stage turbine blade (vented) which is expected
to provide improved cooling characteristics and be more reliable when
operating at high temperatures.

&quot;With respect to the improved first-stage turbine blades, the
Safety Board recommends:

1. Incorporation of the “vented” first-stage turbine
blade in ali JT9D series engines be the subject of
regulatory action as soon as sufficient production
is assured and service bulletins and engineering
orders are formulated by the manufacturer.

&quot;Water tnjection is presently being used on an optional basis
by individual operators. Since water injection allows utilization
of 45,000 pounds of thrust versus 43,500 pounds for take-off, some
operators elect to use water only when takeoff weight, runway
lengths, and ambient temperature conditions require the maximum
thrust rating of 45,000 pounds.</div>

2. ANALYSIS AND CGNCLUSIONS 2.1 Analysis

There was no evidence of structural failure,
malfunction, or abnormality of the airframe,
contro! systems, powerplants, and other comnponents other than the failure of the No. 1
engine. The failure of this engine occurred at a
height of approximately 50 feet and above V4
speed. Failure of this engine would not have
caused the accid’ .t, as the aircraft at the time of
the engine failuse was capable of continuing to
climb on one engine and to make a subsequent
safe landing. The only causal factors involved in the accident were those directly associated with the
powerplants and the operational procedures
used by the crew. In assessing the powerplant factors involved,
it was confirmed that the Ne. 1 engine was not
rotating at ground contact. The cause of the
inflight failure of the engine was a M082 heatcode first-stage turbine blade failure. This blade
failure is typical of other M082 heatccde failures
ia that the blade material contained a concentration of 1.6 parts per million of che cramp eletacnt bismuth, Laboratory examination of previous M082 heatcode blade failures &lt;-eclosed
concentrations of 1.4 co 1.9 parts per million of
besmuth. The airline operators and the engine manyfacturer are cognizant of this problem. The
engine manufacturcr has recommended that the
first-stage turbine blades be examined at the
next heavy maintenance and that all blades
identified with heatcode M082 be removed from
setvice. To accomplish this, United Air Lines initiated
a prograny on March 13, 1970, to identify and
remove these blades from service. United had

I

examined more than 260 engines in the implementation of this program. The No. 1 engine was scheduled for examination at the next heavy maintenance check,
which would notmally have occurred at 5,800
hours or less. Ie is apparent the No. 2 engine was in an
operable condition at the time of the accident. All tie evidence reveals the engine was operating
in the aie, during the thrust reversing cycle, and
until the aircraft came to rest. Results of examination and testing of the fuel
pump drive shaft showed that the fracture was
caused by fatigue resulting from a rotating beam
type loading. The ioading induced on this shaft was due to
an extreme misalignment between the fuel pump
and the spur gear drive shaft. tt was estimated
that che misalignment created a bending stress in
excess of 180,000 p.s.i. in the fucl pump drive
shaft. Such a high bending stress results in
ratchet marks, indicating multiple fatigue
origins, which increase in number with the
degree of stress concentration and stress level. The number of cycles to failuce is primarily
dependent on the level of this bending stress. In
this case, the number of cycles is assumed to
have been low.</div>

cause of this accident was the termination of the takeoff, after the No. 1
engine Failed, at a speed above V» at a
height of approximately 50 feet, with
insufficient runway remaining to effect a
sate landing, The captain&#x27;s decision and
his action to cerminate the takeoff were
based on the erroncous judgment that
both engines had failed. 3. RECOMMENDATIONS

During its deliberations, the National Transportation Safety Board found that important
safety lessons were evident from the facts, conditions, and circumstances of this and similar
accidents. The Board, therefore, recorimenils to
the Fee-ral Aviation Administration the fol-

lowing:

1. Reassess the respective duties and responsibilities of the captain and the first officer
during critical pases of flight.</div>

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] Such a high bending stress results in
ratchet marks, indicating multiple fatigue
origins, which increase in number with the
degree of stress concentration and stress level. The number of cycles to failuce is primarily
dependent on the level of this bending stress. In
this case, the number of cycles is assumed to
have been low. Inspection of the fuel pump
drive shaft fracture surfaces revealed an extremely high number (at least 50) of fatigue
origins.

[t is not possible to determine the specific
number of cycles from the initiation of the
crack to failure since the stress level and time
exposure arc not known, However, based on
laboratory tests conducted at higher than
normal bending load (180,060 p.s.i.}}, there is an
indication that the failure could have occurred
in less than 2,000 cycles from initiation of the
crack, This was evidenced by the similarity
between the rig failed shaft and engine failed
shaft in thae the rig failure had at least 40
fatigue origins. These origins were very similar in
appearance. This type of fracture could have occurred
only at impact when the shaft was sulojected to
an extreme misalignment over a short period of

time. The location of the O-ring rub indicated
thac the shaft was operating in an improperly
aligned position,

The roller bearing on the gearbox drive shafe
nearest the fuel pump had pieces of the backside
of the inner race broken out. The only plausible
explanation is severe distortion of the gearbox
housing which resulted in a thrust load from the
outer race being teansferred through the rollers
to the inner race. Microscepic analyses performed on the four
first-stage nozzle guide vanes showed that the
metal splattcr on the vanes was aluminum. Similar matevial was found lodged in the cooling
air spigot of « vane and was deposited inside the
vane core surfaces. The soutce of the aluminum
was the chain link fence that the aircraft passed
through, approximately 2,000 feet afser tauchdown. The melting point range of this type
aluminum is approximately 1,150 to 1,250°F.

in addition to the tactallurgica! analysis findings of the fucl pump drive shafe failure at
impact, there are other factors to substantiate
the fact that the No. 2 engine was operating at
couchdown and throughout the overrun. The turbine inlet temperature decay graph
shows at fucl shutoff the remperature will drop
from 1,800°F. to 900°F. in 1 second and down
to 600°F. in 2 seconds. It is recognized that turbine vane cooling rate
is slower than the rate of decay of turbine intet
gas temperature. However, the uniformity and
degree of adherence of the aluminum splatter
observed on the blades and vanes indicated that
sutticient heat, pressure, rotation, and air flow
were available upstream of the first-stage nozzle
guide vanes co mele and fuse the alurninum splatter to the vanes and blades.</div>

The stage 1 to stage 2 rotor bolt heads were smeared with this M-50
alloy steel. The failure of the stage 1 to stage 2 rotor bolts and the subsequent
failure of the stage 1 Jow pressure turbine rotor was caused by the
impingement of the pieces of M-50 alloy steel un the rotor bolts. The engine&#x27;s main bearings are inade of M-50 alloy steel. All of the
main engine bearings forward of the low pressure turbine section were
undamaged,

The part of the low pressure turbine cavity where the M-50 fragments
were found is sealed from the path of gas flow through the ngine. The
M-50 fragments could not have migrated either forward or aft into the
low pressure turbine cavity while the engine wus in operation,

The M-50 fragments found inside the low pressure turbine rotor cavities
were not part of this engine. Debris from the stage 1 low pressure turbine rotor disk eut the slat
follow-up cable which connects the inboard slni actuator mechanism to
the servo valve. The right wing outboard slat group was almost
completely retracted as a result of this damage. The Nos. 1 and 3 hydraulic systems were inoperative from lack of fluid. The firewall fuel shut off valve actuating cables and the fire
extinguishing discharge line from the two agent bottles for the No. 3
engine were severed. The No. 3 engine&#x27;s thrust lever control cable was
severed. All three generator AC buses and all TR buses remained powered. The
stall warning systems and flight director systems remained operative. V2 speed was 6 KIAS faster than the slats retracted stall speed. Had the
engine failure occurred at or after V1 speed, the flighterew should have
been able to continue the takeoff safely. The DC-10-30 cngine installation configuration and its leading edge wing
slat system were certified in accordance with the applicable regulations
and Special Conditions. The present certification regulations do not establish precise standards
and guidelines for analyzing the effects of an uncontained rotor burst. 3.2 Probable Cause

The National Transportation Safety Board uecermines that the probable cause
of this accident was the failure of quality control inspections to detect the presence of
foreign material in the low pressure turbine cavity during the reassemb’y of the low
pressure turbine module after installation of the stage 1 low pressure turbine rotor disk.</div>

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] This cross sectional area would &quot;neck down&quot;
during a turbine disk overspeed. In addition, the metallurgical examination of the pieces
of the failed disk showed no evidence of preexisting fatigue or cracking and that the
fracture surfaces were consistent with overstress separations. In order for the stage 1 low pressure turbine rotor to have accelerated to the
overspeed condition, it would had to have been free of the torque load of its rotor
assembly. This freedom was accomplished by the failure of some of the 60 bolts which
attached the stage 1 rotor to the stage 2 rotor at the bolted flanges of their spacer arms. Five pieces of foreign material--M-50 alloy steel-- were found in the engine. Three of
these pieces were found in the low pressure turbine&#x27;s stage 2 rotor cavity; two pieces were
found in the engine&#x27;s stage 1 toroid cavity. In addition, the stage 1 to stage 2 bolt heads
were smeared with M-50 alloy steel. This condition indicated that, over a relatively lcag
period, the impingement of this material damaged a sufficient number of these 60 bolts to
destroy the bolts&#x27; capability to hold the stage 1 rotor to the stage 2 rotor. The bolts
failed, the rotors separated, and the stagei rotor was free of its rotor

assembly load. Asa result, the stage 1 rotor disk oversped during the high takeoff power
demand on the engine. The overspeed resulted in tne fragmentation of the rotor disk and
exit of the fragments through the low pressure turbine casing. Consequently, the Safety
Board concludes that the faiture of the stage 1 low pressure turbine rotor disk was caused
by the foreign material in the engine. The five frrngments of M-50 alloy steel found inside the low pressure turbine
module were severely oxidized and battered indicating that they had been exposed to heat
and impact damage for a considerable period. The main engine bearings of the CF6
engine fleet are made with M~50 alloy steel; however, all the main bearings forward of
the low pressure turbine section were undamaged and all the engine bearings’ inner races
were intact. In addition, the part of the low pressure turbine section where these
fragments were found is sealed from the path of gas flow through the engine. Consequently, this material could not have migrated either aft or forward into the low
pressure turbine cavity while the engine was in operation. The evidence appears
conclusive that either these fragments were inside the low pressure turbine module when
it was installed on the engine or they got inside the turbine module the last time it was
disassembled and were not detected during maintenance. Further, the battered condition
of these fragments precluded all attempts to match them with the toois used in the engine
build-up procedure, or with any other type M-50 alloy steel tool, consequently the Safety
Board could not identify the source of these M-50 alloy stee) fragments,

Exainination of the damaged low pressure turbine indicated that the initial
exit of the rotor disk fragments occurred just outboard of the top of the engine.</div>

the cams, and the valves, bore no evidence of a sustained overspeed con-
‘dition that would have contributed to the malfunctions. Sinjlurly, the master rod bearings for the Nos. G and 3 cylinders
evidenced no indications of bearing chatter, burning and/or spalling to

indicate a distressed bearing condition as the initiating mechanism of
the engine failure. Metallurgical examination of the hold dow studs for Nos. 6 and 8
cylinders showed that, in both cases, the studs on the aft side of the
eylinder bas? hed failed in tension and those on the forward side nad
failed in canbined tension, bending, and shear. The pattern of failures
indicated thet the No. 6 cylinder barrel had bent slightly forward and
upward, and the No, 8 cylinder barrel had been bent forward and slightly
to the left as the studs on the forwani sides failed. None of the studs showed ai.y evidence of fatigue failure. These finiings, in addition to the lack of any significant pounding
camage to the base of the crankcase, indicate that the cylinder separations
were of a secondary nature rather than an initiating factor, as would be
caused by the cylinders&#x27; lifting off the crankcase mount base due to a
fatigue feilure of the hold down studs. Tre remains cf the &quot;I&quot; section of the broken No. 6 master rod
were attached to the piston and exhibited eviderce of fatigue over an
area enccapassing one-eighth of the &quot;I&quot;. Examination of the part revealed no apparent menufacturing or retallurgical defect that would
cause a master rod failure either through stress or fatigue; however,
a slight turned-over section was observed at the master red facture
which would indicate that the rod had been subjected to bending in the
direction of failure. Further, the type and extent of the breakup within the front
cylinder crankcase was typical of the damage that would cccur as a
resuit of &amp; master rod failure. Therefore, it is considered that the
failure ~-f the No. 6 master rod was most probably the initiating factor
resulting in the engine disintegration. However, as was stated previously,
there was insufficient evidence to support this conclusion positively. Other possibilities for the initial failure would include a link
rod or piston separation which would produce much the same type of danage. However, due to the massive damage, these possibilities cannot be confirmed. Inascuch as the failure occurred shortly after lirtoff, it is
cifficult to explain why it was not secured and its propeller feathered
within a reasonable tine following the ralfunction. Conver-ely, inspection of the exsninable portions of the No. 4&amp; engine disclosed only the
oil pressure relief valve problen, discussed previously, but no other
evidence of a failure or malfunction thst sould have necessitated its
discontinuance, yet the propeller was observed in the feathered position

shortly after takeoff. This propeller stayed in the feathered positim

2. ANALYSIS AND CONCLUSIONS 2.1 Analysis

The No. 2 engine sustained a massive failure. The No. 4 engine oti
pressure relief valve tested functionally belcw the recomended operating
limits following the accident. As discussed .nder Section 1.12, various
coaponents of the No. 4 engine were destroyed by impact and ground fire
and could not be documented as to operability prior to impact. However,
the examinable portions of the No. 4 engine as well as the Nos. 1 and 3
engines and all other structure, systems, and components of the aircraft
revealed no evidence of any preimpact failure or malfunction. A review of the maintenance records indicates that the aircraft
had been maintained in accordance with the procedures and regulations
prescribed by CDA and the Dominican Government ard vithin the requirements of the applicable ICAO provisions. All required aircraft inspections and overhauls had been performed within specified times.

_ he captain and first officer were properly certificated in accordance
with the requirenents of the Dominican Governnent and the ICAO provisions
and, accordingly, were qualified to conduct this flight. A flight engineer

is not required for Carvair operations; however, in this instance, 2
CDA flight engineer (DC-6 qualified) was assigned to the flight and
was seated in the observer seat in the cockpit. It is concluded thet the initial failure of the No. 2 engine
occurred immediately after takeoff when it emitted heavy shite smoke. Witness observations, as well as the physical evidence found in the
engine and on the propeller, indicate that the engine continued to
cperste, or was at least winduilling fron air strean effect, throughout the rest of the flight until impact. This continued operation
resulted in almost complete destruction of the internal cperatirg
components of the front rov cylinders. The No. 2 engine was completely disassexbled in an attenpt to
isolate the initial mode end mechanism of the failure. The state of
physical destruction of the front row link rods, master rod and pistons,
hovever, precluded positive definition of the initial failure. The
condition of the internal operating parts in the vicinity of the Nos. 6
and £ cylinders, as well as the evidence of these cylinders’ having
separeted frac the crankcase base prior to impact, does indicate,
however, that the failure sequence originated in this vicinity. Exanination of the engine tearings, the conponents associated with
the cams, and the valves, bore no evidence of a sustained overspeed con-
‘dition that would have contributed to the malfunctions. Sinjlurly, the master rod bearings for the Nos. G and 3 cylinders
evidenced no indications of bearing chatter, burning and/or spalling to

indicate a distressed bearing condition as the initiating mechanism of
the engine failure.</div>

the white smoxe, a few puffs of black smoke were observed
coming fros the right side of the aircraft, in the
vicinity of the No. 4&amp;4 engine. Tie No. 4 propeller was feathered shortly after takeoff. The No. 2 propeller was not feathered during the flight. The flight was attempting to return to the airport and
land on Runway 27R. Examination of the No. 2 engine revealed that it had
experienced a massive failure of the internal operating
components of the front row cylinders. Because of the
damage to these components, the cause of the failure
could not be positively determined. There was a small area of fatigue evidenced on the broken
end of the No. 6 master rod from the No. 2 engine. Several components of the No. 4 engine were destroyed. by
fire and could not be documented as to operability prior
to impact. However, the examinable portions of the

No. 4 engine, as well as the Nos. 1 and 3 engines and
all other structure, systems, and components of the aircraft, revealed no evidence of any preimpact failure or
malfunction. Functional testing of the No, 4 engine ofl pressure relief
valve after the accident showed oil pressure values that
were below the recommended operating limits. Aircraft performance data for the Carvair ATL. 98 shows
that with two engines inoperative at a gross weight of
69,710 pounds, level flight cannot be maintained and that
a descent rate of approximately 170 feet per minute can
be expected. With the aircraft in a turn, and the No. 2
engine windmilling, the descent rate would be increased. Tne aircraft descended into industrial tuicdings approximately 1 mile from the approach end of Runway 27R at the
Miami International Airport.

(bo) Probable Cause

Te Safety Board determines that the probable cause of this accident
was the confused action on the part of the crew while attenpting to cope
with the catastrophic failure of an engine during takeoff.

-273. RECOMMENDATIONS

The Board considers the present standards and recommended practices
(SARP&#x27;s) established under the provisions of ICAO to be adequate. Furthermore, such SARP&#x27;s are subjected to continuing international review in the
interest of assuring that required amendments are made in a timely manner. The record of the investigation of this accident does not show any
contravention of the airworthiness requirements imposed by these international standards. However, the matter of compliance with certification,
*aining, and a number of other operational practices required by these
standards, could not be verified by review of official records during
this investigation. Under the provisions of Article 38 of the ICAO convention, a member
State may indicate full compliance with all existing ICAO standards and
practices by simply not registering any differences. No notification to
ICAO in this regard implies full compliance with these standards by the
ember State. However, there is no international surveillance authority
or system to insure such compliance.</div>

accident illustrates further the need for early accomplishment of these
measures to insure that this critical information is available to all
piiots. 2.2 Conclusions (a) Findings

1. Neither wrather nor air traffic control were
factors in this acciderc.

2. When the aircraft was between 50 and 100 feet
above the runway, its left engine fatled because
the crankshaft broke at the No. 7 crankcheek. The crankshaft broke because a pre-existing
fatigue crack had propagated through the
crankcheek and the cheek could no longer
withstand ncrmal operating stresses. No material defects were found in the crankshaft
that could have contributed to the initiation

of the crack. The reason for the initlation of

the crack was not determined, but it probably was
initiated by a combination of residual stresses and
operating stresses. The right engine continued to function normally
after the left engine fatled. According to performance. charts and flight tests,
the aircraft was cupable of climbing about 300
fre at 117 mph witht one engine inoperative, its
propeller feathered, and the landing gea™ retracted. According to performance charts and fligh* tests,
the aircraft could not maintain level or climbing
flight in the takeoff configuration with one engine
inoperative and its propeller windmilling, and a
descent of 100 to 200 fpm was required to maintain
te: soff airspeed.

Following failure of the left engine, the

pilot lost control of the aircraft because

he permitted the airspeed to decrease below Vee,
and he permitted the aircraft to stall. The pilot did not retract the lending gear
either before or after the engine fatted. The left propeller probably feathered automatically

after the camshaft broke; however, until the propeller
blade angles had increased substantially, the propeller
would have windmilled and would have produced significant
drag. The pilot&#x27;s ability to maintain flight after the
engine failed was marginal beceuse of nix rime
conditions, the aircraft&#x27;s low altitude, and

the aircraft&#x27;s inability to climb or maintain
lev-1 flight in the takeoff configuration with

one engine inoperative and its propeller initially
windmilling. The accident was not survivable because of the
high impact forces generated by the high rate
of descent and the fire that erupted after
impact. (b) Probable Cause

The National Transportation Safety Board determines that
the probable cause of this accident was the sudden failure of the airplane&#x27;s left engine at a point on the takeoff flightpath where the
airplane&#x27;s single-engine performance in the takeoff configuration anu
{{ts height above the ground combined to make the pilot&#x27;s ability vo

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS AND CONCLUSIONS &gt; ANALYSIS] The Safety Board&#x27;s metallurgical tests disclosed no material defects in
the crankshaft, nor did the manufacturer&#x27;s testing produce a probable
operating stress that could have contributed to the initiation of the
fatigue crack. Therefore, the cause of the crack&#x27;s initiation was not
determined. However, because ne metallurgical defects existed, we
believe that the crack probably was initiated by stresses inherent and
applied; that is, by a combination of residual stresses (which probably
were introduced sometime during the manufacturing process) and normal or
cbnormal operating stresses. Although major repairs had been made to the left engine abuut
a year before the accident, there is no evidence that these repairs
affected the condition of the crankshaft. This is because the fatigue
crack originated from a subsurface crea rather than an area that might
have been exposed and damaged during the course of the repair work,

The right engine continued to function properly after the left
engine failed. The ccndition of the right propeller indicates that it
was turning at a relatively high rpm at impact but was not under full
power from the engine. This condition is consistent with the pilot&#x27;s
apparent retention of lateral and directional cuntrol of the aircraft,
whicn struck slightly right-wing low, because he probably reduced power
or the rigiit engine sometime shortly before tryact in an effort to
control the aircraft laterally and directionally.

-~ 15 -

The exact time at which the crankshaft broke wars not determined. However, since the landing gear apparently remained extended until the
aircraft struck the ground, the crankshaft probably broke before the
pilot normally would have retracted the gear, or when the aircraft was
somewhere between 50 and 100 feet above the runway. Consequently, che
pilot probably was distracted from tnitfally retracting the gear hy the
failure of the left engine. After the engine failed, the pilot apparentiy did not perform
the first item in the &quot;Engine Failure After Lift-Cff&quot; procedure because
the landing gears were extended in the wreckage. It is not known why he
did not retrac® the gears, but under the circumsrances, and where insufficteat
runway remains on which to land the aircraft, an almost instinctive
reaction might have occurred: An immediate atterpt to seek and correct
the cause of the perceived engine malfunction and, in the process, to
increase the aircraft&#x27;s altitude by increasing the rate of climb at the
expense of any ecess airspeed. It is possible that this pilot reacted
in such a@ manner.

(n the other hand, considering (1) the possible elapsed time
between engine failure and impact, (2) the rapid degradation tn airspeed
that occurs after loss of an engine if the landing gear are not retracted,
the propeller feathered, or the pitch attitude decreased, and (3) the
single-engine stall speed of near 90 mph, the pilot had little time or
altitude in which to recognize the problem and respon? with the appropriate
corrective action.</div>

traveled after impact, the crushed and flattened unterside of the fuselage
and engines, and the impact damage to the pilots&quot; and passengers‘ seats. The Safety Board is concerned thet such an engine failure can
be catastrophic. We believe that 13 fractures in the same area of the
No. 7 crankcheek for undetermined reasons are sutficient to indicate
that a problem exists with ttis particular crankshaft. Because the
reason for the initiation of -ne futigue crack probably involved a
combination of residual stresses and operating stresses, we believe it
important that the wanufacturer continue its efforts to identify and
eliminate the causs: of the crack initiation. Yiese efforts should
include a complete analysis of residual stresses introduced during the
manufacturing process. Furthermore, the Federal Aviation Administration
should initiate a program: (1) For inspecting the crankshafts from I10520 series en;zines for cracks whenever the crankshafts are available for
inspection, ana (2) for reviewing the results uf these inspections to
determine whether any deficiencies exist in chese engines. However, because engines fail for many reasons, including a
substantial number involving operator errcer, and to fur her reduce the
possibility that catastrophic accidents of this kind will be repeated,
we believe that improvements are needed in the information and training
on single-engine performance that is provided to pilots of light twinengine airplanes. Most pilots of these aivplanes are probably aware
that, under some combinations of gress weight, density altitude, and
airspeed, the airplanes can maintain level flight or climb in the takeoff
configuration with one engine inoperative and the propeller windmilling. These generally are tine conditions which pSlots are exposed to in training,
initial checkouts, and flight checks. However, they may or may not know
that under other conditions, the airplane will be unable to climb or
maintain level flight in the takeoff configuration with one engine

inoperative and its propeller windrilling. This is particularly true

for high gross weights and high density altitudes--conditions that the
average pilot is not exposed to in training. Consequentiy, a careful
study and analysis of the =irplane&#x27;a performance charte, if available i,
is required to deternine the airplane&#x27;s single-engine capabilities for

a given set. of conditions. Many pilots night not fully appreciate the its significance of
Vac 865 related to aircraft stall speeds with takeoff power on one engine. As shown in the Baron 58 flight tests, the single-engine st3l&#x27; speed in
the takeoff conf-guration was near 90 mph, cr quite close to the certificated
Vac Of 94 mph. Also, although the test aircraft was controllable at 90
mph, it is likely that iateral and dircctional controi beiew Vy, would
be difficult to maintain with full power on one engine the lower density
altitude existing at the time of the accident.</div>

the 300-knot or greater airspeed required for the windmill engine restart procedure
and then did not demonstrate command authority by taking control of the airplane and
accelerating it to at least 300 knots. Conclusions
71
Aircraft Accident Report
11. The first officer’s limited experience in the airplane might have contributed to the
failed windmill restart attempt because he might have been reluctant to command the
degree of nose-down attitude that was required to increase the airplane’s airspeed to
300 knots. 
12. Despite their four auxiliary power unit-assisted engine restart attempts, the pilots
were unable to restart the engines because their cores had locked. Without core
rotation, recovery from the double engine failure was not possible.
13. The General Electric CF34-1 and CF34-3 engines had a history of failing to rotate
during in-flight restart attempts on airplanes undergoing production acceptance
testing at Bombardier.
14. Both engines experienced core lock because of the flameout from high power and
high altitude, which resulted from the pilot-induced extreme conditions to which the
engines were exposed, and the pilots’ failure to achieve and maintain the target
airspeed of 240 knots, which caused the engine cores to stop rotating; both of these
factors were causal to this accident.
15. The importance of maintaining a minimum airspeed to keep the engine cores rotating
was not communicated to the pilots in airplane flight manuals.
16. The captain’s previous difficulties in checklist management, the situational stress, and
the lack of simulator training involving a double engine failure contributed to the
flight crew’s errors in performing the double engine failure checklist.
17. The pilots’ failure to prepare for an emergency landing in a timely manner, including
communicating with air traffic controllers immediately after the emergency about the
loss of both engines and the availability of landing sites, was a result of their
intentional noncompliance with standard operating procedures, and this failure was
causal to the accident.
18. The pilots’ unprofessional operation of the flight was intentional and causal to this
accident because the pilots’ actions led directly to the upset and their improper
reaction to the resulting in-flight emergency exacerbated the situation to the point that
they were unable to recover the airplane.
19. Revised high altitude training syllabuses for pilots who operate regional jet airplanes
would help ensure that these pilots possess a thorough understanding of the airplanes’
performance capabilities, limitations, and high altitude aerodynamics.
20. Because most training for stalls occurs with the airplane at low altitudes, the training
methods may introduce a bias in stall recovery techniques by encouraging pilots to
minimize altitude loss and not fully recognizing other available recovery techniques. Conclusions
72
Aircraft Accident Report
21. Additional training might improve pilot response to stickpusher activation, but such
training, if not provided correctly, could have an adverse impact on existing stall
recognition and recovery protocols.

out from high power and high altitude, whereas the engines installed on the production
airplanes were shut down only after their internal temperatures were stabilized.108
Flameouts at high power and high altitude produce even greater thermal distress
because internal temperatures are the hottest at high power settings and the air is colder at
high altitudes. The increased thermal shock exacerbates the loss of component clearance
106 The FDR parameter for the LCV position shows that the valve is open once it reaches a position that
is greater than 4.8º from its normally closed position.
107 The FDR recorded a steady decline in engine oil temperature after the upset and showed that this
steady decline ceased at the time of the engine restart attempts. 
108 On November 20, 2006, the Safety Board issued recommendations to the FAA to address this and
other core lock-related issues; see sections 1.18.3.1 and 4.3 for information. Analysis

and alignment. Because the accident engines flamed out under these conditions, axial
misalignment caused the seal teeth, which were positioned aft of their normal operating
grooves, to contact stationary abradable material when radial seal clearances closed down. Once core rotation stopped, binding prevented core rotation from resuming during the
windmill and APU-assisted restart attempts. No physical evidence of core lock was found
inside the engines because the thermally induced interference occurred after core rotation
had stopped and operating clearances were restored afterward as the engine cooled. The Safety Board concludes that both engines experienced core lock because of
the flameout from high power and high altitude, which resulted from the pilot-induced
extreme conditions to which the engines were exposed, and the pilots’ failure to achieve
and maintain the target airspeed of 240 knots, which caused the engine cores to stop
rotating; both of these factors were causal to this accident. 
2.2.3.1 Performance of the Double Engine Failure Checklist
A critical error made by the flight crew while performing the double engine failure
checklist was failing to establish and maintain an airspeed of 240 knots before beginning
the procedures to restart the engines. During the public hearing on this accident, a GE
manager testified, “as long as core rotation is maintained, you will not have core lock …
we have a body of data that shows that 240 knots maintains core rotation.”
Another critical error made by the flight crew was failing to increase the airspeed
to at least 300 knots before beginning the windmill restart procedure. About 2159:16,
when the FDR resumed operation after a loss of power lasting about 4 minutes, the
airplane’s airspeed was 178 knots. About 2200:38, the captain told the first officer to
increase the airspeed to above 300 knots, and the first officer acknowledged this

airspeed to 300 knots. However, FDR data showed that the maximum airspeed achieved
during the procedure—236 knots—was achieved only briefly.</div>

Aircraft Accident Report
The Safety Board considered whether engine hardware was a factor contributing to
the lack of core rotation. However, engine teardowns found no mechanical failures or
evidence of any condition that would have prevented engine core rotation. The Safety Board then considered whether an electrical or mechanical problem
interfered with the ability of the cores to achieve rotation. However, inspection and testing
of the APU and other airplane start system components found no conditions that would
have prevented torque delivery to either engine during the four APU-assisted restart
attempts. Also, FDR data showed that the LCV was open during these restart attempts,106
and testing showed that it was capable of providing pneumatic power from the APU to
start initial rotation in each engine. A systems simulation study (see section 1.16.4)
showed that the LCV had likely opened by at least 18º during the flight, which should
have resulted in some detectable core rotation if the engine cores were capable of rotation. In addition, the change in engine oil temperatures107 showed that air was flowing through
the ATS. This finding, along with the results of the airplane start system component
testing, showed that the LCV was likely fully open. The Safety Board considered whether the slight increases in core-driven hydraulic
pump pressures shown on the FDR during the final minutes of the flight (as described in
section 1.16.3) were evidence of engine core rotation. The airplane’s start system was
operating normally during the restart attempts; thus, if the cores were free to rotate, they
would have quickly accelerated. As a result, the Board determined that the slight increases
in hydraulic pump pressures that were recorded on the FDR were not the result of engine
core rotation. On the basis of the information discussed in section 1.18.2, the Safety Board
concludes that the GE CF34-1 and CF34-3 engines had a history of failing to rotate during
in-flight restart attempts on airplanes undergoing production acceptance testing at
Bombardier. GE attributed the problem to interference contact at an air seal in the high
pressure turbine and, along with Bombardier, referred to this condition as core lock. The
lack of core rotation on the accident airplane engines was similar to the instances of core
lock experienced by CF34 engines during Bombardier’s acceptance testing, except that
the accident airplane engines were exposed to more severe thermal distress than the
engines on the production airplanes. Specifically, the accident airplane’s engines flamed
out from high power and high altitude, whereas the engines installed on the production
airplanes were shut down only after their internal temperatures were stabilized.108
Flameouts at high power and high altitude produce even greater thermal distress
because internal temperatures are the hottest at high power settings and the air is colder at
high altitudes.</div>

showed that, despite the loss of rotational speed caused by water ingestion,
combustion was not lost. Therefore, the Safety Board concludes that
neither the presence of, nor the absence of, engine ignition during the
first loss of rotational speed was a factor in the ultimate loss of
thrust. Engine rotation speed increased on at least one engine about
36 sec after the first loss of normal electrical power because the CVR,
FDR, and communication radios returned to normal operation. Although
the recovery of rotational speed to generator operating speed or above
could have been related to reduced water ingestion, as demonstrated in
the engine tests, the Safety Board believes that recovery was more
likely related to thrust lever advancement--a pilot&#x27;s normal reaction to
a loss of engine RPM. Additionally, the flight was attempting to climb,
which normally would require higher thrust settings. Passenger and flight attendant testimony verifies that both
engines surged and stalled while the aircraft was in heavy rain just
before the engines quit. The engine tests and the analysis of JT8D
compressor developmental data indicate that at low rotational speeds
ingestion of large quantities of water is likely to cause surging in the
aft stages of the high-pressure compressors which could produce overpressures
in the low-pressure compressors sufficient to cause blades to deflect and to
clash against the vanes in these compressors. Moreover, throttle advancement under these conditions is likely to aggravate the surging and
stalling. Consequently, the Safety Board concludes that after rotational
speed was first lost, the throttles more advanced, and surging and
stalling occurred which caused blades in the low-pressure compressors to
clash against the vanes. This conclusion is supported by the physical
damage to the engines. The damage to both low-pressure compressors
indicates that the sixth-stage blades deflected forward, clashed with
the fifth-stage stator vanes, and broke pieces from the blades and
vanes. Pieces of vanes and blades were then ingested into the highpressure compressors, causing extreme damage to these compressors. TheSafety Board further concludes that the lack of typical foreign object
damage, including hail damage from known encounters, to the fan blades
and the blades in the forward stages of the low-pressure compressors
clearly indicates that hail ingestion was not responsible for the
compressor damage. If the thrust levers remained at relatively high thrust settings
after the compressors were damaged, high fuel flow in conjunction with
reduced compressor efficiency would cause overtemperatures in the turbine
sections of the engines. The damage to the turbine sections of both
engines clearly indicates overtemperatures before the engines quit.

1

Finally, the internal physical damage to the engines clearly
indicates that, following the damage to the compressors and turbines,
the engines were no longer capable of producing thrust. After the
engines ceased to function, about 1610:56, normal electrical power again
was interrupted. This interruption lasted about 2 min 4 sec, and the
power undoubtedly was restored by the operation of the APU generator
because the CVR and FDR again began to function.</div>

2. ANALYSIS AND CONCLUSIONS 2.1 Analysis

The pilots were certificated properly and were qualified for
the flight. They had received the off-duty time required by regulation. There was no direct evidence, that medical or physiological factors might
have affected the flightcrews performance. The aircraft was certificated, equipped, and maintained in
accordance with regulations and approved procedures. Before encountering
the precipitation and hail which immediately preceded the loss of power
from the engines, there was no evidence of a failure or a malfunction of
the aircraft&#x27;s structure, powerplants, or flight controls. Moreover,
except for the possibility that the aircraft&#x27;s weather radar system may
not have been functioning effectively, there was no evidence that any
of the aircraft&#x27;s other systems had failed or malfunctioned. From an evaluation of all the evidence, the Safety Board
concludes that the causal factors related to this accident are associated
with the severe weather conditions that Flight 242 encountered near
Rome, Georgia, the extent of the flightcrew&#x27;s knowledge of those conditions

‘before the encounter, and the information about those conditions provided
to the flightcrew. After the severe weather conditions were encountered
and thrust from the engines was completely ‘and permanently lost, an
accident most probably was inevitable.

2.1.1 Engine Failures and Flightcrew Reactions

The engine tests, the review of. JT8D compressor research data,
and passenger and flight attendant testimony produced a viable theory of
how N1335U&#x27;s engines were damaged so severely. Clearly, based on passenger and flight attendant testimony,
radar weather reports, and the CVR, the aircraft flew in rain most of
the time after it departed Huntsville and flew in heavy rain and. hail
for about 2 1/2 min immediately before thrust was lost completely from
the engines. Although the intensity of the rain and hail is not known,
the Safety Board concludes that the intensity was sufficient to cause
the rotational speed of the engines to decrease below that required for
operation of the engine~driven generators. This is supported by the 36sec loss of normal electrical power which began at 1607:57 while the
aircraft was in heavy rain and hail. Furthermore, the Safety Board
concludes that engine rotational speed was lost shortly after the thrust
levers were retarded to low settings~-probably flight idle--in preparation
for the descent from 17,000 to 14,000 ft. Passenger testimony supports
this conclusion. Also, the engine tests proved that rotational speed
will be lost at low thrust settings if water is ingested at a rate
greater than 14 percent water-to-air ratio. The engines did not lose combustion during the first loss of
rotational speed because they surged and stalled, which could only have
occurred if the compressors were being driven. Also, engine tests’
showed that, despite the loss of rotational speed caused by water ingestion,
combustion was not lost. Therefore, the Safety Board concludes that
neither the presence of, nor the absence of, engine ignition during the
first loss of rotational speed was a factor in the ultimate loss of
thrust.</div>

limitations of the airborne radar is vital. Since little was contained
in the Bendix manuals about the effects of attenuation on the RDR-1E
radar, the flightcrew of Flight 242 may not have been fully aware of
these limitations. We believe, therefore, that existing airborne radar
should not be relied on exclusively for severe weather detection under
these circumstances.

3. CONCLUSIONS 3.1 Findings

1. Flight 242 penetrated a severe thunderstorm between
17,000 and 14,000 ft near Rome, Georgia, while en route
from Huntsville, Alabama, to Atlanta, Georgia.

2. The ingestion of intense rain and hail into N1335U&#x27;s
engines caused the rotational speed of both engines to
decrease below the engine-driven electrical generator
operating speeds, and resulted in normal electrical power
interruption for 36 secs.

3. Rotational speed on at least one engine increased
sufficiently to restore its generator to operation and
provide normal electrical power.

4. The rotation speed of one or both engines was probably
increased by advancement of the thrust lever(s).

5. Shortly after the initial loss of rotational speed,
both engines&#x27; high-pressure compressors began to
stall severely.

10.

ll.

12.

13.

14.

15. The stalls probably resulted from a change in
high-pressure compressor operating characteristics
induced by trust lever advancement and ingestion of
massive quantities of water. The severe compressor stalls produced an overpressure
surge which deflected the.compressor blades forward in
the sixth stage of the low-pressure compressors; these
blades clashed against the fifth-stage stator vanes
and broke pieces from the blades and vanes. Pieces of blades and stator vanes were then ingested
into the high-pressure compressors and damaged them
severely.

_ Continued high thrust settings following the severe

damage to the high-pressure compressors probably
caused severe overheating in the turbine sections of
botn engines, and the engines ceased to function. Normal electrical power was again lost for 2 min 4 sec
until the APU-driven generator restored electrical power. After the engines failed, an accident was probably
inevitable because Southern Airways’ flightcrews had
not. received, nor were they required to receive,
training or information on emergency landings with
all engines inoperative. Before departing Huntsville, the flightcrew of Flight 242
had no information on thunderstorms immediately west of
the Rome VOR.

‘While en route to the Rome VOR, the flightcrew received

no information on the existence of the storms immediately -
west of the Rome VOR except for the indications displayed
on their airborne radar system. Based on information from the airborne radar, the
captain of Flight 242 initially decided that the storms
just west of the Rome VOR were too severe to penetrate. Shortly after his initial assessment of the storm
system, the captain decided to penetrate the storm
area near the Rome VOR.

that it had seized suddenly but that the engine had continued to operate for some
time following failure. There were hot gas erosion holes in one-half of the turbine
wheel shroud and silhouette imprints of the turbine wheel blades on the housing. Both conditions indicate thet hot exhaust gases impinged for an appreciable time
on the turbine wheel while it was stationary. Further, metal transfer between the
compressor impeller blades and housing and the turbine wheel blades and housing
indicates that a severe imbaiance of the turbine wheel and compressor existed
within the turbocnarger assembly. The wear on the center bearing and the
deformation of the turbine wheel shaft, adjacent to the shaft fracture, are also
consistent with an imbalance condition. Only a sniall portion of the fracture on the
turbine shaft was clean or free of deposits; the remainder contained heavy, lead
rich exhaust gas residues. The deposits indicated that the majority of the shaft
fracture had been exposed ‘o exhaust gases for some time. The discolored fracture
surface exhibited cracking features which had originated at the bottom of the
piston ring groove with fatigue crack propagation toward the irside diameter of the
shaft. However, the crescents indicative of this type of cracking did not extend to
the inside diameter. Thus, the final fracture probably occurred rapidly because of
an overstress condition. As a result, the fracture was subjected to hot gases
escaping through the turbine whee: shroud. The material found on the outside diameter of the broken shaft,
adjacent to the turbine wheel, and the niston ring groove sidewall had a chemical
composition consistent with the piston ring. This indicated that the ring was
smeared between the shaft and the inside diameter of the center housing, This
condition could have occurred from unbalanced rotational forces. The Safety Board was unable to determine precisely the source that
initially produzed the imbalanced condition in the turbocharger assembly.
uwevert, since all the turbine wheel blades were broken near the tips, the blades
probably were broken as a result of foreign object damage (FOD). Such damage
would produce severe turbine wheel imbalance and the conditions found in the
turbocharger assembly, Similar conditions have been documented by the
manufacturer in known FOD damaged turbochargers. While it is possible tha’ the

turbine shaft may have fractured totally, or in part by itseif, precipitating the
imbalance, the Safety Board concludes that, because of the exhaust valve guide
findings, the weight of evidence indicates that the lower portion of the No, 5
cylinder exhaust valve guide caused damage to the turbine blades which produced
an imbalanced condition and led to seizure of the turbocharger. The former
condition was the most probable occurrence of the imbalance condition. The airport manager&#x27;s observation of a large umount of gray smoke

from the pilot&#x27;s physical ability to operate the aircraft. The aircraft was properly certificated and was maintained in
accordance with approved maintenance procedures; however,
inadequate maintenance was performed during replacement of the
No. 5 cylinder of the left engine 4 days before the accident. The left engine turbocharger was malfunctioning before the
accident. The turbocharger failed as a result of an imbalance and ceased
operating after liftoff. A portior of the fractured exhaust valve guide from the No. 5
cylinder probably damaged the turbocharger&#x27;s turbine wheel
blades before the cylinder was replaced 4 days before the
accident. The left engine sustained a substantial loss of power because the
turbocharger ceased operating. The propeller was capable of
normal operation. The right engine and propeller were capable of normal operation. The teft propeller, which was capable of normal operation, showed
minimal evidence of rotation at impact and was transitioning to
the feather position during the impact sequence. The right propeller was in the low pitch position and was
producing power at impact. The aircraft&#x27;s climb oerformance was very inarginal because of
the high density altituce conditions and gross weight at takeoff. The pilot failed to feather the propeller in a timely manner and
did net establish the aircraft in a minimum drag attitude
following the power loss. The required sideslip technique used in engine-out procedures may
not have been emphasized in the ptlot&#x27;s flight training.

14... The horizontal and vertical peak crash loads were estimated to be
within the limits of human tolerance.

15. There were no apparent seat or restraint system failures.
16. The fuel tanks ruptured during principal tree impact.

17. The fuel dispersed on impact and was probably ignited by hot
engine components which caused an intense postimpact fire.

18. There were no significant traumatic injuries.

19. The cause of deeth of all occupants was attributed to burn injuries
due to the intense posterash fire.

3.2 Prodabie Cause

The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable
cause of the accident was a substantial loss of power from the left engine at a
critical point in the takeoff and the failure of the pilot to establish a minimum
drag configuration which degraded the marginal single-engine climb performance
of the alecraft. The loss of power resulted from seizure of the turbocharger
fottowing progressive failure of the turbine wheel blades initiated by foreign object
ingestion which had occurred previous to this flight and was not detected during
maintenance on the engine 4 days before the accident.

4, RECOMMENDATIONS

As a result of this investigation, the Safety Board reiterates Safety
Recommendation A-79-80 which was issued to the FAA on May 17, 1978:

Require that pilots Involved in 14 CFR 135 operations be
thoroughly trained on the performance capabilities and
handling qualities of aircraft when loaded to their maximum
certificated gross weight or to the limits of their e.g.
envelope, or both.</div>

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] The former
condition was the most probable occurrence of the imbalance condition. The airport manager&#x27;s observation of a large umount of gray smoke
emenating from the left engine 3 days before the accident is consistent with the
damage in the turbocnarger. The turbine wheel imbalance would have disrupted its
bearing seal and would have allowed passage of lubricating oil by the compresscr
into the induction system to be burned in the combustion chambers of the engine. The witness&#x27; belief that the appearance of (he gray smoke was associated with a
reduction in power is logical since there would be significantly lower combustion
temperatures at idle power to burn the oil than at a high power setting. A seized turbocharger would have caused a significant drop in manifold
pressure and power from the left engine. At full takeoff power, the manifold
pressure developed is 40 inHg. With an inoperative turbocharger, the manifold
pressure loss would be 3 to 5 inHg. below the normelly aspirated value of about 22
inHg. Also, there would be a corresponding imbalance in the fuel/air mixture ratio
with the loss in manifold pressure due to a reduced induction airflow. The
consequence of this condition would have been an overly rich mixture, a rough
operating engine, an additional reduction in power, end the emission of black
smoke. Evidenve of such a condition ‘existing in the left engine was observed on
the exhaust valve heads, on the ceramic insulation of the spark plug electrodes, on
spark gap surfaces, on components of the turbocharger, and from witnesses&#x27;
reports, When such a condition occurs, it is necessary to manually lean the engine
to achieve the best (uel/air mixture ratio. Although the AFM does not specifically
direct such action in the event of engine roughness, it instructs the pilot to analyze
the problem and secure the engine if roughness persists. The eircraft was also observed in a descending shallow left turn
although the pilot had asked for a straightout departure. Impact occurred 45° to
the left side of runway 21. The Safety Board concludes that the pilot was
confronted with a partial but substantial loss of power from the left engine shortly
after liftoff due to the failure of the turbocharger. He apparently was able to
initially establish a climb; however, the aircraft reportely did not climb more than
200 feet above the runway. The postimpact positions of the fuel selector valve
handles indicate that he may have suspected a fuel problem. If this was the case,
he would only have had to crossfeed the left engine from the tight tank. The
postimpact positions of the throttle, mixture, and propeller lever, as well as the
propeller governor operating arm of the left engine, are evidence that, at sore
point, he deliberately shut down the left engine and feathered its propeller. The
two impact marks on the butt face of one propeller blade showed, however, that
the left propeller blades were transitioning to the feather position at the time of
the crash.</div>

                        <div class="chunk-text">[CONCLUSIONS &gt; FINDINGS] The HPT stage 2 disk initially separated into two fragments. One 
fragment penetrated through the inboard section of the right wing, severed the main engine 
fuel feed line, breached the fuel tank, traveled up and over the fuselage, and landed about 
3,000 ft away. The other fragment exited outboard of the right engine, impacting the runway 
and fracturing into three pieces. 
4. The high-pressure turbine stage 2 disk failed because of multiple low-cycle fatigue cracks that 
initiated from an internal material anomaly, known as a discrete dirty white spot, which formed 
during the processing of the material from which the disk was manufactured. 
5. The discrete dirty white spot was most likely not detectable by the inspection methods used 
during production of the high-pressure turbine stage 2 disk. 
6. Additional Federal Aviation Administration and industry efforts are needed to determine if 
enhanced ultrasonic inspection methods are a best practice for inspecting nickel parts during 
manufacturing. 
7. The fatigue cracks that initiated from the discrete dirty white spot were not detectable at the 
time of the high-pressure turbine stage 2 disk’s last inspection using the surface-based 
inspection techniques mandated by the applicable airworthiness directive. 
8. If a subsurface inspection technique, such as an ultrasonic inspection, had been required at the 
time of the high-pressure turbine stage 2 disk’s last inspection, the cracks that developed from 
the discrete dirty white spot should have been detectable because of the size of the cracks at 
that time and the sensitivity of ultrasonic inspection techniques. 
9. Future aircraft certification efforts would benefit from guidance on uncontained engine failure 
debris models and resulting design mitigations that is based on lessons learned from recent 
in-service events. 
10. The captain made a timely decision to reject the takeoff and performed the maneuver in 
accordance with company training and procedures. NTSB 
Aircraft Accident Report

11. The captain’s decision to perform the engine fire checklist was appropriate given his training, 
the information provided by air traffic control, and the fire warnings in the cockpit. 
12. Engine fire checklists that specifically address ground operations would allow a flight crew to 
secure an engine and command an evacuation, if required, in a timelier manner than engine 
fire checklists that do not differentiate between ground and in-flight operations. 
13. The flight attendants made a good decision to begin the evacuation given the fire on the right 
side of the airplane and the smoke in the cabin, but the left overwing exit should have been 
blocked while the left engine was still operating because of the increased risk of injury to 
passengers who evacuated from that exit. 
14. If the flight crew or the flight attendants had communicated after the airplane came to a stop, 
the flight crew could have become aware of the severity of the fire on the right side of the 
airplane and the need to expeditiously shut down the engines. 
15. American Airlines did not adequately train flight attendants qualified on the Boeing 767 to 
effectively use the different interphone system models installed on the airplane during an 
emergency.

Trent 900 engine.102 According to the ATSB, the failure in the No. 2 engine sent engine disk 
fragments through the left wing, which damaged some of the airplane’s systems. Safety 
Recommendation AO-2010-089-SR-040 asked the FAA to do the following:103 
In cooperation with the European Aviation Safety Agency, review the damage 
sustained by Airbus A380-842, VH-OQA following the uncontained engine rotor 
failure overhead Batam Island, Indonesia, to incorporate any lessons learned from 
this accident into the advisory material. The final report on the accident, issued in June 2013, stated that the amount of damage to 
the airplane resulting from the uncontained engine rotor failure “was greater than the modelling 
outlined in the advisory material,” which provided a means of compliance with airframe 
certification standards. The advisory material included AC 20-128A. In a December 2016 letter to the ATSB, the FAA stated that it was evaluating uncontained 
engine failure events, including the event referenced in the ATSB’s recommendation, to 
understand the “failure effects” of these events. The FAA also stated that it would use that 
information to update AC 20-128A. The FAA further stated that its Technical Center tasked the 
US Naval Air Station China Lake to (1) update the uncontained engine debris model defined in 
the FAA’s 1999 report on its large engine uncontained debris analysis and (2) develop computer 
modeling of more recent uncontained engine failures. The FAA indicated that a draft revision to 
AC 20-128A was expected by the end of 2016 and that it would provide the ATSB, by June 30, 
2017, with an update of actions related to the recommendation. In August 2017, the FAA requested 
an extension to November 6, 2017, for responding to the ATSB. On December 6, 2017, the FAA 
responded to the ATSB, indicating that a draft revision of AC 20-128A was expected by the end 
of 2018.</div>

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] The airplane stopped on the runway about 26 seconds after the “bang” sound. The NTSB 
concludes that the captain made a timely decision to reject the takeoff and performed the maneuver 
in accordance with company training and procedures. The uncontained engine failure resulted from an HPT stage 2 disk rupture (rotor burst). 
The HPT stage 2 disk was recovered in four fragments (shown in figure 5 in section 1.3.3). One 
disk fragment and other exiting engine debris fragments (for example, blades, static hardware, or 
HPT stage 2 disk posts) impacted and penetrated through the inboard section of the right wing, 
creating two separate holes (shown in figure 7 in section 1.3.3). Disk fragments “B,” “C,” and “D” 
were recovered outboard of the right engine (to the north of the airplane); as a result, they could 
not have caused the damage observed inboard of the engine. In addition, disk fragments B, C, and D were likely part of a single disk piece that had 
fractured into three separate fragments after impacting the runway. Specifically, an impact ground 
scar/gouge was observed about 32 ft to the right of the runway 28R centerline (outboard of the 
right engine location). This ground scar/gouge was consistent with impact from a single HPT stage

2 disk fragment. Thus, this disk fragment was most likely intact as it exited the right engine and 
nacelle and impacted runway 28R, creating the observed ground scar/gouge and fracturing into 
three pieces. The overstress fractures on disk fragments B, C, and D were consistent with a hard 
impact, which would be expected given the exit velocity, size, and weight of the disk fragment 
before it fractured. Disk fragment “A” was recovered about 2,935 ft south of the uncontainment location at a 
UPS building. Hole 1 (located in the inboard section of the right wing forward of the front spar) 
was too small for disk fragment A to fit through, and the edges of the hole exhibited tearing and 
ripping that were consistent with impact from smaller debris with less momentum, such as that 
from exiting engine debris fragments. The trajectory of the released debris showed that the debris 
did not impact the front spar but instead continued upward and exited the top of the leading-edge 
panel. The trajectory for the disk fragment causing the damage to the inboard section of the right 
wing aft of the front spar (hole 2) showed that the fragment entered the dry bay through the lower 
wing skin, severed the main engine fuel feed line, severed rib No. 6 (part of the inboard dry bay 
boundary), and continued through the upper wing skin.74 To create this damage, a large disk piece 
with significant energy would be needed. Disk fragment A weighed about 57 pounds and 
represented more than one-third of the disk.</div>

documentation and analysis of the No. 2 engine components and surrounding 
structure, led the Safety Board to conclude that the No. 2 engine stage 1 fan 
disk fracture and separation was the initial event that led to the liberation 
of engine rotating parts with sufficient energy to penetrate the airplane&#x27;s 
structure. 
· 
· 
Shortly after the engine failure, the crew noted that the hydraulic 
fluid pressure and quantity had fallen to zero in the three systems. Approximately l minute after the engine failure, the FDR recorded no further 
powered movement of the flight control surfaces. Consequently, the No. 2 
engine failure precipitated severe damage that breached the three hydraulic 
systems, leaving the flight control systems inoperative. Titanium alloy was found on the fracture surfaces of severed lines 
of hydraulic systems No. 1 and No. 3 located in the right horizontal 
stabilizer. Several of the major components of the engine, including the 
stage I fan blades and fan disk, were made from titanium alloy and no other 
components of the surrounding airframe were made from such material. These 
factors led the Safety Board to conclude that the systems&#x27; No. 1 and No. 3 
hydraulic lines were severed by fragments released during the failure 
sequence of the No. 2 engine. The loss of hydraulic system No. 2 required further analysis. The 
engine-driven No. 2 hydraulic pumps were attached to and received power from 
the No. 2 engine accessory section. This unit was mounted to the engine 
directly below the fan section of the engine. Portions of the No. 2 engine 
accessory section and associated No. 2 hydraulic system components, including 
hydraulic supply hoses, were found in the Alta, Iowa, area. Therefore, 
portions of the No. 2 hydraulic system and supply hoses mounted on, or 
adjacent to, the No. 2 engine accessory section were damaged and separated by 
the forces and disruption of the engine fan section during the engine 
failure. The investigation disclosed no evidence of other system anomalies 
that would have contributed to the hydraulic system or flight control 
difficulties experienced in the accident. 
2.3 
Performance of UAL 232 Flightcrew 
Because of the loss of the three hydraulic systems, the flightcrew 
was confronted with a unique situation that 1 eft them with very limited 
control of the airplane. The only means available to fly the airplane was 
through manipulation of thrust available from the No. 1 and No. 3 engines. The primary task confronting the flightcrew was controlling the airplane on 
its flightpath during the long period (about 60 seconds) of the &quot;phugoid&quot; or

Probable Cause 
The National 
Transportation Safety Board determines that the 
probable cause of this accident was the inadequate consideration given to 
human factors limitations in the inspection and quality control procedures 
used by United Airlines&#x27; engine overhaul facility which resulted in the 
failure to detect a fatigue crack ori-ginating from a previously undetected 
metallurgical defect located in a critical area of the stage 1 fan disk that 
was manufactured by General Electric Aircraft Engines. The subsequent 
catastrophic disintegration of the disk resulted in the liberation of debris 
in a pattern of distribution and with energy levels that exceeded the level 
of protection provided by design features of the hydraulic systems that 
operate the DC-lO&#x27;s flight controls.</div>

segments. Further, the AC is predicated on a three-piece disk rupture with 
only 1/3 of the disk penetrating the airplane. The Safety Board believes 
that in future aircraft certifications, the FAA, when assessing compliance by 
the airframe manufacturer with 14 CFR 25.903, should require that the engine 
manufacturer provide, and the airframe manufacturer consider, fragment sizes 
,and energies such as those encountered in this accident. In addition, in the case of large fragments, such as the fan disc 
segments, the spread angle or dispersion area as defined in AC 20-128 may be 
inadequate. This

inconsistancies 
between 
the 
predictions of AC 20-128 and the realities of the actual damage to the 
airframe in this accident. Also, the fact that there was titanium alloy 
transferred to the No. 4 banjo frame may mean that the banjo piece moved into 
the dispersion path. However, it may also mean that the frame was struck by 
the uncontained fragment of the rotor disk assembly when the fragment was.

the spread angle is then a function of the disk fragment dimensions and 
should be considered when showing compliance with 25.903. Therefore, the 
Safety Board recommends that the FAA analyze the dispersion pattern, fragment 
size, and energy level of released engine rotating parts in this accident and 
include the results of this analysis, 
and any other peripheral data 
available, in a revision of AC 20-128 for future aircraft certification. Following this accident, the Safety Board attempted to obtain 
historical. data and recent operating experience regarding engine rotating 
part failures and noncontainment events. The most recent information readily 
available were the two SAE reports that provided data only through 1983. The 
Safety Board is concerned that there may not be a central repository for a 
current and complete data base for engine rotating part noncontainment 
events. The Safety Board believes that the FAA should review the current 
reporting requirements for manufacturers and operators to establish a 
centrally available data base of these events based on operator and engine 
manufacturer knowledge and inservice experience. The Safety Board recommends that the FAA establish a system to 
monitor the engine rotary parts failure history of turbine engines and to 
support a data base sufficient for design assessment, comparative safety analysis 
among 
manufacturers, 
and 
more 
importantly, 
to 
establish 
a 
verifiable background for the FAA to research during certification review. This system should collect worldwide data by means of the reporting 
requirements for manufacturers contained in 14 CFR Part 21.3.</div>

pilot followed the recommended procedures for
an engine failure or fire in-flight. ‘The indication
that the left propeller was feathered at impact
was not necessarily the result of the manipulation of cockpit controls; in case of loss of engine
oil pressure the propeller would feather regardless of pilot action, if the loss occurred at sufficient pm. The focl and oil shutoff valves
behind the firewall were cable controlled; duc to
the stretching and separation of these cables
during the airframe breakup, the postcrash position of these valves would be an unreliable indicator of pilot actions, The switch thay controls
the boost pump in the left inboard fuel cell was
not recovered, A fire-induced failure in the
pressure live to the fuel selector would result in
fuel spillage regardless of selector position,

With regard to the propagation of the fire
from the engine compartment into the wheel
well, the available evidence suggests that the fire
burned through the left engine cowling, and
progressed around the firewall, and then burned
through the wheel-well skin immediately below
the right augmenter tube. In this manner the fire
would have entered the wheel well, below the
fuel selector valve installed on the rear of the

firewall. The burning of one or more of the
aluminum fuel lines in this area would lead to an
intense, uncontrollable wheel-well fire. The direct exposure of the unprotected wingspar caps
to the fire in the wheel well led quickly to hea
weakening of these load-carrying structures. The
most intense fire occurred at the rear spar location; this spar was probably the first to lose its
structural integrity, The subsequent increase in
the tensile loads on the heated lower forward
spar cap resulted in an upward overload failure
of the left wing. 2.2 Conclusions (a) Findings
1, The aircraft was certificated in
accordance with existing regulations. Improper maintenance procedures were utilized during the
installation of the cylinders on
the left engine. The pilot was certificated and
qualified for the flight. Fire in the left engine commenced with the separation of
No, 5 cylinder :ssembly. Uncontrolled fire progressed
from the engine nacelle into the
wheel well. The left wingspar cap was weakened by heat and eventually
caused the in-flight separation oF
the lef wing,
The aircraft structure of the
Beech Model 65 lacks adequate
fire protection. (b) Probable Cause
The Nationa! Transportation Safety Board
determines that the probable cause of this accident was an uncontrolled fire in the left wheel
well which resulted in loss of structural integrity
of the left wingspars.</div>

fire, Most of the smoke and flames would have
been forced outside, under the wing, through
the exhaust augmencter tubes. These indications
of fire would not have been readily apparene
frora che cockpit until the right side of the left
engine cowl or the upper wingskin above the
wheel well burned through. Based on witnesses’ report of unusual engine
sounds, and the mutilated condition of the No.
5 piston, it appears that the pilot did not immediately secure the left engine when the No. 5
cylinder became inactive. Despite vibrations,
some power would still have been available,
which might have prompted the pilot to attempt
a landing on the cleared, hard-surface runway at
Fairfield. The left turn described by the witnesses scoms to support this speculation, although this also happened to be the direction of
predominant asymmetrical thrust. It could not be determined to what cxtent the
pilot followed the recommended procedures for
an engine failure or fire in-flight. ‘The indication

the nuts were not installed, or if they were installed but not tightened. The engine manufacturer reported that untorqued nuts have
been observed to back off the studs in approximately 10 minutes engine operating time. The
three recovered lower studs failed as a result of
alteriating bending overloads produced by the

cylinder pivoting about these studs with the nuts
probably still in place. When these studs eventually failed, the cylinder was released and
moved away from the crankcase, at the same
time displacing the exhaust stacks away from
the augmenter tube and probably against the
cowl door. It is apparert that the engine manufacturer&#x27;s
cylinder teplacument procedures were not
followed. Had the prescribed tightening sequence been followed, it is highly unlikely that
any nuts would have been omitted or left untightened. It should be noted, however, that
there are convincing reasons which attribute the
improper maintenance procedures in this case to
fatigue of the mechanics involved, rather than
to their carelessness or incompetence. In order
to have the aircraft ready for the Sunday
morning departure, the two mechanics worked
approximately 27 hours on the preceding Friday
and Saturday. ‘They finished their task around
midnight, Saturday. The error potential implied
in such a situation is a direct reflection on the
quality control of the airline’s management
maintenance program,

The reason for the left-engine fire was directly
related to separation of the No. 5 cylinder. This
separation allowed engine oil to be pumped and
spilled into the engine compartment in the
immediate vicinity of the right augmenter tube. In addition, the No, 5 intake manifold pipe
probably separated from the central induction
system, thereby releasing a combustible fuel-air
mixture, Ignition could easily have been caused
by the exhaust stacks of the Nos. 1 and 3 cylinders or by a broken ignition wire from the No, 5
cylinder. The melting of the aft bracket that
attaches the first stage of the augmenter assenibly to the engine support, as well as the burning
of the adjacent cowling, the fucl lines to the

uncontrolled fire for fuel tanks located in impact areas did not adequately minimize the hazards to 
the 767-200 and -300 airplanes from an uncontained engine failure. The NTSB concludes that future aircraft certification efforts would benefit from guidance 
on uncontained engine failure debris models and resulting design mitigations that is based on 
lessons learned from recent in-service events. Therefore, the NTSB recommends that the FAA 
revise AC 20-128A, based on an analysis of uncontained engine failure data since the time that the

3. Conclusions 3.1 Findings 
1. The flight crew was properly certificated and qualified in accordance with federal regulations 
and company requirements. A review of the flight crew’s work and sleep schedules and recent 
activities showed no evidence of factors that could have adversely affected the performance of 
either crewmember on the day of the accident. 
2. The airplane was properly certificated, equipped, and maintained in accordance with federal 
regulations. No evidence indicated any structural, engine, or system failures before the 
uncontained engine failure occurred. 
3. The right engine experienced an uncontained high-pressure turbine (HPT) stage 2 disk rupture 
during the takeoff roll. The HPT stage 2 disk initially separated into two fragments. One 
fragment penetrated through the inboard section of the right wing, severed the main engine 
fuel feed line, breached the fuel tank, traveled up and over the fuselage, and landed about 
3,000 ft away.</div>

the flight crew could have become aware of the severity of the fire on the right side of the

15. American Airlines did not adequately train flight attendants qualified on the Boeing 767 to 
effectively use the different interphone system models installed on the airplane during an 
emergency. 
16. The Federal Aviation Administration’s inadequate actions to improve guidance and training 
on communication and coordination between flight and cabin crews during emergency 
situations, including evacuations, could lead to negative consequences for the traveling public 
if this safety issue continues to be unresolved. 
17. The flight crewmembers and flight attendants did not coordinate in an optimal manner once 
the passengers were evacuated. 
18. Evidence of passengers retrieving carry-on baggage during this and other recent emergency 
evacuations demonstrates that previous Federal Aviation Administration actions to mitigate 
this potential safety hazard have not been effective. 3.2 Probable Cause 
The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of this 
accident was the failure of the high-pressure turbine (HPT) stage 2 disk, which severed the main 
engine fuel feed line and breached the right main wing fuel tank, releasing fuel that resulted in a 
fire on the right side of the airplane during the takeoff roll. The HPT stage 2 disk failed because 
of low-cycle fatigue cracks that initiated from an internal subsurface manufacturing anomaly that 
was most likely not detectable during production inspections and subsequent in-service inspections 
using the procedures in place. Contributing to the serious passenger injury was (1) the delay in 
shutting down the left engine and (2) a flight attendant’s deviation from company procedures, 
which resulted in passengers evacuating from the left overwing exit while the left engine was still 
operating. Contributing to the delay in shutting down the left engine was (1) the lack of a separate 
checklist procedure for Boeing 767 airplanes that specifically addressed engine fires on the ground 
and (2) the lack of communication between the flight and cabin crews after the airplane came to a 
stop. NTSB 
Aircraft Accident Report 
77 4. Recommendations 
4.1 New Recommendations 
As a result of this investigation, the National Transportation Safety Board makes the 
following new safety recommendations: 
To the Federal Aviation Administration: 
Establish and lead an industry group that evaluates current and enhanced inspection 
technologies regarding their appropriateness and effectiveness for applications 
using nickel alloys, and use the results of this evaluation to issue guidance 
pertaining to the inspection process for nickel alloy rotating engine components. 
(A-18-3) 
Require subsurface in-service inspection techniques, such as ultrasonic inspections, 
for critical high-energy, life-limited rotating parts for all engines. (A-18-4) 
Revise Advisory Circular (AC) 20-128A, “Design Considerations for Minimizing 
Hazards Caused by Uncontained Turbine Engine and Auxiliary Power Unit Rotor 
Failure,” based on an analysis of uncontained engine failure data since the time that 
the AC was issued, to minimize hazards to an airplane and its occupants if an 
uncontained engine failure were to occur.</div>

fragment penetrated through the inboard section of the right wing, severed the main engine 
fuel feed line, breached the fuel tank, traveled up and over the fuselage, and landed about 
3,000 ft away. The other fragment exited outboard of the right engine, impacting the runway 
and fracturing into three pieces. 
4. The high-pressure turbine stage 2 disk failed because of multiple low-cycle fatigue cracks that 
initiated from an internal material anomaly, known as a discrete dirty white spot, which formed 
during the processing of the material from which the disk was manufactured. 
5. The discrete dirty white spot was most likely not detectable by the inspection methods used 
during production of the high-pressure turbine stage 2 disk. 
6. Additional Federal Aviation Administration and industry efforts are needed to determine if 
enhanced ultrasonic inspection methods are a best practice for inspecting nickel parts during 
manufacturing. 
7. The fatigue cracks that initiated from the discrete dirty white spot were not detectable at the 
time of the high-pressure turbine stage 2 disk’s last inspection using the surface-based 
inspection techniques mandated by the applicable airworthiness directive. 
8. If a subsurface inspection technique, such as an ultrasonic inspection, had been required at the 
time of the high-pressure turbine stage 2 disk’s last inspection, the cracks that developed from 
the discrete dirty white spot should have been detectable because of the size of the cracks at 
that time and the sensitivity of ultrasonic inspection techniques. 
9. Future aircraft certification efforts would benefit from guidance on uncontained engine failure 
debris models and resulting design mitigations that is based on lessons learned from recent 
in-service events. 
10. The captain made a timely decision to reject the takeoff and performed the maneuver in 
accordance with company training and procedures. NTSB 
Aircraft Accident Report 
76 
11. The captain’s decision to perform the engine fire checklist was appropriate given his training, 
the information provided by air traffic control, and the fire warnings in the cockpit. 
12. Engine fire checklists that specifically address ground operations would allow a flight crew to 
secure an engine and command an evacuation, if required, in a timelier manner than engine 
fire checklists that do not differentiate between ground and in-flight operations. 
13. The flight attendants made a good decision to begin the evacuation given the fire on the right 
side of the airplane and the smoke in the cabin, but the left overwing exit should have been 
blocked while the left engine was still operating because of the increased risk of injury to 
passengers who evacuated from that exit. 
14. If the flight crew or the flight attendants had communicated after the airplane came to a stop, 
the flight crew could have become aware of the severity of the fire on the right side of the 
airplane and the need to expeditiously shut down the engines. 
15. American Airlines did not adequately train flight attendants qualified on the Boeing 767 to

temperatures and therefore requires most precise monitoring
of all vital operating parameters and effective analysis of
any confirmed deviations from normal parameters,

Vibratory stresses in exzess of four times their normal
level were imposed upon the second-stage vane feet after
stress rupture of first-stage turbine blades. Multiple failures of second-stage vane feet and resultant
rearvard shift of the nozzle inner support caused rubbing
of the support against the second-stage turbine disk until
separation of the disk rim occurred,

Deterioration of vital engine operating parameters was
evident on both the narrative portion of the flight log

and the computerized engine condition monitor log. Maintenance actions taxen by the carrier in attempting to
correct the in-flight discrepancies as reported on the
No. 1 engine were not responsive to the problem that existed. While the computerized engine monitor log used by the carrier
was effective in accurately identifying the progressive
decrease of N2 and increase in EGT and fuel flow, the data
was not available for use in time to effect corrective action
prior to severe engine failure,

The fire which resulted from the turbine failure was terminated by the immediate response of the flightcrew in sucecssfully shutting off fuel supply to the No. 1 pylon. The fire
extinguishing agent appeared to have little effect in conbating the fira. The results of the primary failure affected other systems
critical to the landing phase and compounded the already
existing emergency by placing an additional burden upon the
flightcrevw. PROBABLE CAUSE

Tne National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable
caus: of this incident was e progressive faflure in the high-pressure turbine sodule in the No. 1 JTYD-3\ engine. This failure was initiated by
the undetected stress rupture fractures of several first-stage turbine
blades and culminated in in-flight separation of the second-stage turbiuie
disk rim.

-lRECOMMENDATIONS AND CORRECTIVE ACTION

On September 25, 1970, the Board sent the following letter to the
Adninistretor of the Federal Aviation Administration:

“The National Transportation Safety Board is now investigating
the JT9D-3 engine failure and in-flight fire involving American
Airlines, Boeing 747, N743PA, which occurred during takeoff from
the San Franetsco International Airport on Septemher 18, 1970. A
failure occurred in the No. ] engine 13 seconds after lift-off,
followed by a fire warning. The flight returned to the airport
after shutdown of the engine and extinguishing of the engine fire.

&quot;During the return to the airport, the flightcrew experienced
difficulty in extending the landing gear and the wing flaps after
parts of the feiled engine severed the hydraulic and pneumatic
systems&#x27; supply lines. The captain elected to &quot;go around&quot; and
extended the landing gear by the alternate system.</div>

                        </div>
                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS AND CONCLUSIONS] The
fire inside of the pylon continued with such intensity that both of
the agent containers became physically detached from their mountings
and fell to the bottom of the pylon structure. This fact alone can
leave little doubt that the fire continued for some time after the
agent was discharged. It is the opinicn of the Board that the fire
terminated only when the sources of flammable materials became exhausted,
In this respect, termination of fuel supply was effective since the fuel
line was severed downstream of the firewall shutoff valve which was
closed by the timely action of the flignterew. Flame propagation over
both the top and bottom of the wing was such that there was danger of
ignition of the fuel which was leaking out of the punctured fuel tank
access plates. In the ease of the No. 1 hydraulic system supply, line severance
occurred between the reservoir and the shutoff valve, allowing depletion
and Jeaxage into the fire area of the total fluid supply for the No. 1
system. Fluid supply was then no longer available to the No. 1 system&#x27;s
air-driven hydraulic pump. This pump normally provides a backup pressure
source for the No, 1 system in case engine pump pressure is either lost
or derands upon it become excessive. Of further significance is the
puncture of the left wing pneumatic duct which supplies pressure for all
of the pneumatically operated units in the left wing. Consequen3ly, the
operation of the No. 2 air-driven hydraulic pump would have been impaired
by greatly reduced pneumatic pressure, if such operation became 4
requirement. The loss of No. 1 hydraulic system, requiring ali ernate extension
of the body landing gear and leading edge flaps, caused a delay in
returning to San Francisco Airport and placed an additional burden upon
the flightcrew during the already existing fire emergency. Although
other, less vital systems were either fully or partially deprived of
normal hydraulic and/or pneumatic pressure, there appeared to be no
further adverse effects upon the operation of the airplane. CONCIUSIONS

From the investigation of this incident, the Safety Board concludes
the following:

1. There were no material deficiencies of the HPT module
which either caused or ccntributed to the failure.

2. The engine had been allowed to attain operating temperatures which were sufficiently in excess of design limits
to initiate stress rupture failures of first-stage turbine
biades. The engine normally operates at relatively high turbine
temperatures and therefore requires most precise monitoring
of all vital operating parameters and effective analysis of
any confirmed deviations from normal parameters,

failure. The initial damage to the engine&#x27;s structure --- the disruption
of the crankcase main section and the penetration of the No. 1 cylinder
ba.rel -- was of such magnitude that the engine’s oil system became
totally depleted in a relatively short time. Once the oil was ignited,
flames and smoke propagated rearward, either below or above the. engine
nacelle&#x27;s structure.

~ 10 -

Since power absorption is a functior of blade angle, propeller
rpm, and airspeed, engine power output at a corresponding airspeed can
be computed. Consequently, propeller performance calculations were made
u: ing a blade angle of 34°, propeller rpm of 2,490, outside air temperature
of 721° F., and 39.10 inches of barometric pressure,

Calculations indicace that, at impact, the right engine was
devetoping near maximum power (in excess of 1,700 brake horsepower) at
an airspeed of about 209 mph. Performance data indicate that the aircraft
was capable of :limbing at 600 fpm with one engine inoperative and its
prepeller feathered. The minimum safe single engine speed is 145 mph. In view of these data, the Safety Board concludes that the
faiiure of the left engine was not, in itself, the cause of the accident. Bused on witness reports, the Safety Board belteves that
flames propagated downward and, subsequently, reached into the bomb bay
area. Once flanes and smote had entered the bomb bay, airflow patterns
allowed cmoke and possibly heat to permeate the crew compartment. The flow of smoke into the cockpit area was intensified when
the crew opened their side windows. Army Technical Order 1B-25(T) N-1
warns against opening the pilot&#x27;s side windows during an engine fire,
since doing so creates a draft from the wing roots into the fuselage. Whether the ccew was familiar with the warning,or whether condittens in
the cockpit became so intolerable that they chose to disregard this
warning, could not be determined. Evidence suggests that conditions in the cockpit had deteriorated
to such a degree that the crew was not able to control the aircraft. No
apparent effort was made to change the pitch attitude of the aircraft or
to reduce power on the right engine before impact. Additionally,
witnesses stated that both pilot and copilot were seen waving their arms
out the window. There was no evidence of fire in the cockpit before impact;
however, the pilot had been burned. Post-mortem examination did not
conclusively establish how or when the pilot sustained these burns. Reasons &#x27; hy neither pilot exhibited searing of their trachea
or high levels of carbon monoxide levels in their blood could aot be
established. It is concluded that the crew&#x27;s vision and possibly their
breathing were inhibited by combustion products in the cockpit and that
the side windows were opened to alleviate this condition. Records concerning the history and maintenance of the aircraft
were either incomplete or missing.</div>

breathing were inhibited by combustion products in the cockpit and that
the side windows were opened to alleviate this condition. Records concerning the history and maintenance of the aircraft
were either incomplete or missing. However, it was determined ‘hat the
engines were neither preserved nor run up during a 2-year perioc after
the purchase of the aircraft by Air Chicago Freight Airlines, Inc., or
at any specified time before the purchase. Preservation of an aircraft engine before extended periods of
inactivity is essential in order to prevent internal corrosion. Likewise,
the engine should be preoiled, before the initial start, following such
a period. Preoiling the engines fs intended to provide adequate lubrication during initial start after prolonged periods of idleness. Analysis of oil samples taken after the accident disclosed
that the oil in both engines contained high concentrations of wear
metals and corrosion products. The Safety Board concludes that failure
to preserve or preoil the aircraft&#x27;s engine during periods of inactivity
can result in the initiaticn of multiple internal failures which can be
catastrophic. The Safety Board also believes that this lack of compliance
with manufacturer&#x27;s recommendations regarding preservation and preoiling
of engines contributed factor to the initiation of vhe accident sequence. 3. Conclusions Findings

l, The aircraft and crewmembers were properly certificated
for the flight.

2. The gross weight and center of gravity of the aircraft
were within allowable limits. There was no evidence of an in-flight structural failure
of the airframe or of the flight control system. The engines were not preserved before a prolonged period
of inactivity, and they were not preoiled before operation. The left engine sustained a massive internal failure that
resulted in the perforation of the No. 1 cylinder barrel
by a section of a separated master rod assembly. Oil from the left engine ignited when it contacted the
exhaust system. The left engine&#x27;s fire extinguisher was discharged. The fire was not contained within the power section of
the left engine and propagated rearward and inboard. The cockpit windows were opened in flight. The cockpit environment was subjected to combustion

products which impaired the crew&#x27;s ability to function
normally during an emergency. Soot patter:s on the aircraft&#x27;s exterior confirmed the
existence o7 an in-flight fire. The right engine was producing near maximum power and the
aircraft&#x27;s single engine performance was not a factor in
the accident.

13. No oxygen or s:roke masks were installed in the aircraft
ner were they required.

3.2

The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the
probable cause of the accident was the deterioration of the cockpit
environment, due to smoke to the extent that the crew could not function
effectively in controlling the aircraft under emergency conditions. The
smoke and fire, origin-ting from a massive failure in the power sectien
of the left engine, prcepagated irto the bomb bay area and then into the
cockpit. The inspection system utilized was not effective in detecting
the impending engine failure.</div>

__ The Safety Board believes that this accident graphically {{llustrates the
potential hazards of an unconteined failure in a large turbine engine operating at high
power. Further, the Safety Board recognizes that the le-ge fvagments and rotating
components that are released from large turbine engines cannot always be contained
within the engine or the nacelle structure with state-of-the-art materials and technology. The Safety Board realizes that during normal operational circumstances, these types of
failures oceur infrequently when compared to the total number of engine operational
hours, Nevertheless, when such a failure does occur the consequences are potentially
catastrophic. I 7 I

 . ‘The Safety Board recognizes the continuing efforts by the Pederal Aviatian
Administration, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, te Department of
Defense, and engine and aircraft manufacturers to develop new materials and technology
to alleviate or minimize the hazards of uncontained engine failures. The Safety Board
urges that all these parties continue their current efforts and expand them to develop new
materials ‘and technology to minimize these hazards. The Safety Board also believes that
the FAA and the manufacturers should review their design and installation eriteria based
cn service experience gained as a result of uncontained failures to assure that the
installation design for critical aircraft components minimize their susceptibility to
damage in the event of a massive failure, recegnizing that these efforts cannot be
expected to apply to the separation of an entire module auch an occurred in this accident.

failure. Thus, the Safety Board concludes that there were no operational irregularities of
any consequence in those phases of the flight. Witnesses were consistent in reporting that their attention was attracted to
the airplane Decause of one or more loud noises, described as “bangs,” and similar to
&quot;shotgun reports,” whieh occurred about the same time they saw flames and/or smoke
from the right engine. The audible &quot;bang,&quot; associated with an engine failure was
confirmed by the CVR. Witnesses did not describe flame emitting from any part of the
aircraft other than the right engine. Examination of the airplane confirmed that there
was no in-flight fire other than thet contained within the right engine. The witnesses
estimated that these events occurred about 300 feet a.g.l. it was determined that the
right engine actually failed about 450 feet a.g.1.

Sixteen witnesses reported that the aircraft seemed to decelerate following
the right engine failure, consistent with FDR data. The deceleration of the airplane was
eaused primarily by the loss of thrust from the right engine. The deceleration also was
influenced by sideslip~induced drag and a reduction of left engine thrust. Reduced
girspeed and increased G load made the airplane susceptible to accelerated stall. The
presence of sideslip made the airplane susceptible to rolling motions. Correlation of the FDR, CVR, and air traffic control] data allowed the Safety
Board to make several determinations regarding the flight. The airplane was climbing
about 168 knots with a 50-foot per second rate of climb when the right engine suddenly
failed. For 3 to 4 seconds, control was maintained with little change in heading,
indicating that there was an initia: correct (left) rudder pedal application. Accelerometer
data showed a reduction of normal G loads, indicating that the airplane&#x27;s pitch attitude
was lowered, apparently to reduce the rate of climb and to prevent a deterioration in
speed. The left rudder pedal application and reduction of the sirplene&#x27;s pitch attitude
were consistent with the normal flight controi responses following loss of thrust from the
right engine of a DC-3 airplane. About 4 seconds after the right engine failed, the
airplane began to yaw rapidly to the right, as indicated on the FDR deta by the 20°

the radar data indieated that the airplane was continuing in a relatively straight track.</div>

engine failure mnust be immediate and appropriate. In other phases of flight. where
delayed recognition or an improper response to an engine failure could result onlv in the
loss of altitude and/or airspeed, a margin for error is available that is not available on

@ takeoff or landing. Third, a failure in a turbojet engine does not aiwavs result in an
xdrupt (occurring in less than 0.5 second) loss of power. Abrupt failures, such as that experienced by flight 165, are rare occurrences
within a category of events that is itself unusual. While oilots are trained to recognize
and respond to engine failures, the training is not generally in response to an abrupt loss
of power. When pilots practice recognition and response to engine failure in an airplane,
particularly at low altitude. to do other than retard the throttle to flight idle to simulate
an engine failure (whee residual thrust is still generated) ean seriously compromise flight
safety. Thus, it is necessary to conduct such training in flight simuletors which do not
respond exactiv as the airplane, following an abrupt loss of power. However. pilot
response to the engine failure shouid De the same regardiess of the cause of the failure
even though the cues which the pilot perceives may vary depending on the characteristics
of the failure. Conseduently, although a pilot&#x27;s response to engine failure in a twin engine
airplane should be invariant, that is, the pilot must fly the airplane safely maintaining
Girectional control through the use of rudder primarily and aileron to a lesser extent, the
recognition and resultant soeed of the response may be affected by the interaction of the
type of failure experienced and the phase of flight im whieh it is encountered. The Midwest Express chief pilot testified that the philosophy of engine fafture
procedures ang crew response to those procedures is based upon the criticalitv of the
Situation. He stated that Midwest Express pilots are allowed more latitude, in terms of
their reaction, in responding to engine failures that occur in less critical phases of flight. He categorized arm engine failure cn takeoff before gear retraction, for example. as being
more critical than an engine failure later in the takeoff climb. This viewpoint is
consistent with the pilot certification requirements stated in the Federal Aviation
Regulations, and it is consistent with the general practice of the sirline industrv.

However, underlying this approach may be an implication that failures that cecur beyond
V1, where immediacy of response may not de as critical, might actually encourage a
delayed crew response to the failure. Thus, the Board studied the possibility that a

perceived lack of criticality in the speed of the response to an engine failure after gear
retraction may have led the erew to delay ecordination of corrective action in response to

the engine failure. Human factors research involving operators of automobile simulators 28/ has
shown that reaction time was related to the nature of the stimulus: the more simple and
intense the stimulus, the faster the reaction time.</div>

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

On April 15, 1988, Korizon Air, inc., flight 2658, a 37-passenger deHavilland DHC-8
registered in the United States as N819PH, was a regularly scheduled passenger-carrying flight
between Seattle, Washington, and Spokane, Washington. Shortly after takeoff, with ihe captain
at the controls, the aircrew noted a power loss on the right engine. The captain made the decision
to return to Seattle for a precautionary ianding. After lowering the landing gear on final
approach, a massive fire broke out in the right engine nacelle. After the first officer shut down the
engine, the captain proceeded to land the airplane; however, shortly after touchdown, the crew
realized that almost all directional control and braking capability was lost. The airplane departed
the paved surface of the runway, crossed a grass median area, entered the paved rarp area, and
struck a runway designator sign, several baggage carts, and two jetways. The airplane came to rest
against another jetway. Four of the 37 passengers sustained serious injuries. The airplane was
destroyed by the fire and impact. The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probabie cause of this accident
was the improper installation of the high-pressure fuel filter cover that allowed a massive fuel leak
and subsequent fire to occur in the right engine nacelle. The improper installation probably
occurred at the engine manufacturer, buwever, the failure of atrlirie maintenance personnel to
detect and correct the improper installation contributed to the accident. Alsc contriouting to the
accident was the loss of the right engine center access panels from a fuel explosion that negated
the fire suppression system and allowed hydraulic line burg through that in turn caused a total loss
of airplane control on the ground.</div>

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] At 1017:13, when the Group 1
synehros were restored, the airplane was at 9,577 feet, at 221 KIAS, and in fairly stable
flight. The EPRs on engines Nos. 1, 2, and 3 had increased from about 1.01 to 1.23 and
were continuing to increase. Since the captain was decreasing the descent rate during
this time and was allowing the airplane to accelerate smoothly, the Safety Board believes
that it was highly unlikely that the airplane ever achieved the necessary 250 KIAS to
perm a successful airstart on engines Nos. 1, 2, and 3 and that, in fact, they had not

amed out. The contention that engines Nos. 1, 2 and 3, did not flame out is further
supported by the following:

1, Cabin pressurization did not drop to the point that passenger
oxygen masks were deployed.

2, The No. 4 generator breaker had opened when the No. 4 engine was
shut down. Had the other three engines flamed out, their three
generators would have tripped and the essential a.c. bus would have
lost power. Had that happened, the DFDR, would have ceased
operating, and, in addition, instrument warning flags would have
appeared, Neither of these events occurred.

3. The engine low oil pressure warning lights did not illuminate. Based on these data, the Safety Board concludes that the Nos, 1, 2, and 3 engines did not
flame out and continued to operate throughout the loss of contral, descent, and recovery. While there can be little doubt that the loss of thrust on the No. 4 engine was
the precipitating factor of the accident sequence, the loss of one engine, albeit an
outboard engine, during high altitude cruise should not cause an experienced flighterew to
lose control of their airplane. Indeed, the Airline Operating Manual does not even classify
this mishap as an emergency procedure. Therefore, the Safety Board directed its
attention to the reasons why the flightcrew was unable to maintain control of the airplane
after the loss of thrust on the No. 4 engine.

2.2 The Flighterew

Although the facts developed during the investigation showed conclusively that
the accident occurred because the captain failed to maintain control of the airplane after
the loss of thrust on the No.4 engine, the Safety Board also sought to determine the
reasons that may have led to the captain&#x27;s inability o= failure to employ the procedures
that would have prevented this from happening. Therefore, in its analysis, the Safety
Board evaluated data contained in past reports of similar secidents, as well as
psychological literature discussing the factors that contribute to breakdowns in decision
making and monitoring capability. These areas ‘ineluded boredom, monotonous
environmental conditions, fatigue due to circadian desynchronosis, and over-reliance on
automated flight systems.</div>

his action to cerminate the takeoff were

During its deliberations, the National Transportation Safety Board found that important
safety lessons were evident from the facts, conditions, and circumstances of this and similar
accidents. The Board, therefore, recorimenils to
the Fee-ral Aviation Administration the fol-

lowing:

did no¢ note both sets of engine instruments
spooling down, and since the left engine svffered
a tapid total power failure, ane must conclude
thar he read the left set cf instruments and
interpreted them to be the right set. Ie can be assumed then. that a tight yaw,
observed by the captain, which may have induced hiin to transpose the instrument readings
to be compatible with a yaw to the right. Ie is
interesting to note that the first officer&#x27;s impression was that the left engine was “spooling
down,”

Perhaps the first officer had a better feel for
the alreraft prior to the captain&#x27;s assuming control. if such a misinterpretation as two which
engine had failed remained fixed, subsequent
subjective “feel&quot; for the aircraft could have been
confusing. In this accident, accurate “feel” for
the aircraft may also have been compromised by

resulted from this action. The increased power
lever input would not have given significant increases in the parameters of response for which
the captain was looking. All three crewmen stated there was a steady
and substantial loss of engine ncise before she
attempt to land was initiated. The decrease of
engine noix associated with the loss of one
engine, located symmetrically with the second
engine in relation to the flight deck, could be
perceived as no mote than a 3 decibel decrease. This decrease, if noted at all, would not be
alarming. It also would not have bcen perce ved
as agradual steady loss. It is difficult to explain the reason the flight
deck crew heard a steady and substantial decrease in engine noise, One possible explanation
is that there is a substantial decrease of engine
noise in the cockpit when an aircraft leaves the
ground on takeoff. The captain&#x27;s assessment of the emergency
was chat the aircraft would not sustain flight. He
was then forced to make en immediate decision
as to where to make the inevitable landing. Since
a portion of the runway was stil visible, his
choice was to land back on the runway. Fucthermore, the need for a rapid decision in order to
effect a return to the runway greatly compromised the time available co assess the emergency. 2.2 Conclusions (a) Findings

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] Assuming some usable fuel was in the left tank, it is probable that the flight crew’s 
maneuvering after the right engine stoppage may have intermittently unported it, causing the 
sequential stoppage and restarting of the left engine. The Safety Board notes that the loss of the 
right engine occurred while the airplane was in relatively level flight and that the left engine 
stoppage occurred during attempts to maneuver back to the ILS course after the stoppage of the 
right engine. Further, the final loss of control may have been precipitated by momentary stopping 
or starting of the left engine when the airplane was at a reduced airspeed. Impact witness marks 
and airplane damage were consistent with a loss of control at low altitude. Observations made during examination of the accident site and the surrounding area were 
consistent with only a small amount of fuel being on board at the time of the crash. Severe fire 
damage was limited to the area immediately surrounding the crash site, suggesting a lack of 
significant fuel splash from the ruptured tanks. The burn pattern also indicated that there was 
little fuel remaining on board at impact. Fuel starvation to the engines caused by the failure of the LP fuel cock circuitry was also 
considered. However, no determination could be made because the LP fuel cock switches located 
in the cockpit were destroyed by impact and fire. The Safety Board notes that the right engine 
and left engine LP valves, which are controlled by the fuel cock circuitry, were found in the open 
position and that the hydraulic LP valves were found open. Loss of fuel en route was also considered. However, witnesses who observed the 
airplane’s departure from ACY saw no indication of leaking fuel from the wings or the fuel caps. Although the right tank fuel cap was not recovered, metallurgical evidence determined that it had 
been in place before impact. Further, the airplane’s manufacturer indicated that, because of the 
outboard location of the fuel caps, spillage or suction from an open fuel tank filler in level flight 
would be minimal and unlikely. Although the Safety Board’s fuel calculations do not demonstrate that the accident 
airplane was completely out of fuel, the Safety Board considered a critically low fuel state to be 
the most likely scenario given the lack of evidence indicating mechanical failures. Federal 
regulations and company policy state that it is the pilot-in-command’s responsibility to ensure 
before departure that the airplane has the correct amount of fuel onboard for the planned flight.</div>

1.18 New Investigative Techniques

None 2. ANALYSIS

The flightcrew was properly certificated and trained in
accordance with applicable regulations. There was no evidence of preexisting medical problems that might have affected the flightcrew&#x27;s
performance. The aircraft was certificated and equipped according to
applicable regulations. The gross weight and c.g. were within prescribed
limits. The aircraft&#x27;s structure and components were not factors in
this accident. There was no evidence of any malfunction of the aircraft
or its control system. The propulsion system was operating and was
producing power until fuel was exhausted. The right engine had been
malfunctioning for some time and caused the flightcrew to operate that
engine on auto-rich fuel mixture during the accident flight and. during
previous flights in order to obtain an acceptable level of performance
from it. Although examination of the engine and its components did not
identify the exact discrepancy, the Safety Board believes that the
discrepancy was of a general nature, such as an ignition or induction
problem, and was not a major mechanical failure. Components of the
right engine&#x27;s ignition system were so badly damaged by impact that
engine to distributor timing could not be determined. Consequently, the
pre-impact condition of the ignition system could not be determined from
the evidence available. Based on wreckage examination, the Safety Board concludes that
both engines ceased producing power because of fuel exhaustion. Only
one quart of fuel was recovered from both engines. Evidence obtained
from the fuel quantity gages indicates that both fuel tanks were empty
at the time of impact. According to the best estimates, the aircraft should have had
about 207 gallons of fuel on board at the time of the accident. This
figure is based on a normal cruise configuration with both engines
operating with &quot;auto-lean&quot; fuel mixture. In order to determine the reason for the discrepancy between
calculated fuel on board and actual fuel on board, the Safety Board
analyzed the following three explanations:

First, there could have been a fuel leak. However, no evidence
of fuel leakage, such as stains or loose fuel tank caps or lines, was
found in the wreckage. Although this possibility cannot be discounted
completely, because there is a remote possibility that leakage evidence
could have been obliterated at impact, the Safety Board does not believe
it to be the most viable explanation. Secondly, the aircraft may not have been fueled with the
amount shown on the fuel slips. The Safety Board considers this explanation
relatively remote because the fuel meters on refueling trucks cannot be
reset and, if functioning properly, will reflect the total amount of
fuel dispensed to a given aircraft. Finally, the engines or an engine could have been burning more
fuel than specified and more than the flightcrew expected to be burned.</div>

A fuel were serviced into each of the aircraft&#x27;s two fuel tanks. The
introduction of the jet fuel resulted in a fuel mixture that was not
compatible with the engines installed. The introduction of the jet fuel
lowered the octane rating of the fuel resulting in high opera: ing
‘temperatures, severe detonation, and extensive and sustained power loss. While engine operation was adequate to accomplish a successful takeoff with the utilization oi the water injection system, the termination
of water supply to the engine subsequent to takeoff resulted in immediate
manifestation of the detonation and/or preignition conditions. The apparent inability of the flightcrew to recognize immediately the symptoms
of detonation, or to assess the cause for this condition, prompted the
application of carburetor heat which further elevated induction temperatures
and contributed to even more adverse detonation condition. Cylinder head
tenperatures of both engines attained the 300° C. gage limit as a result of the detonation and/or preignition, Again the action taken in
opening the cowl flaps, in an effort to rectify this indication, was responsible for increasing drag which adversely affected the critical
thrust/drag configuration of the aircraft,

emergency procedures of single-engine and multiengine aircraft, applicants for
multiengine ratings who possess a single-engine instrument rating should be required to
demonstrate their ebility to conduct safe multiengine operat: wns under actual or
simulated instrument conditions, When an inflight emergency occurs, there is little time
to decide the proper action to be taken. A preestablished plan of action and a thorough
knowledge of the aircraft are requisites for the safe and efficient management of unusual,
unexpected deviations from normal flight conditions, especially when the p.lot is burdened
by the extra tasks associated with flight by instrument reference. The pilot had previously flown about 11 cross-country flights in NICOUV. His
longest flight was 1 8/10 hours. The average time for each cross-country flight was about
1 1/2 hours, It is possible that the pilot may have flown elther all or most of these flights
using only the main fuel tanks. Just as likely, however, is the possibility

that he may have been accustomed to switching to reserve fuel further along in the flight,
rather than shortly after leveling off. Since the amount of fuel onboard at takeoff, the
fuel tank selection, the fuel distribution within the tanks, and the pilot&#x27;s preferred
procedures for takeoff, climb, and cruise are matters of conjecture, no significant
conclusions could be drawn from the available fuel information. Additional evidence Indicates that the aircraft&#x27;s engine(s) may have stopped
because of fuel starvation. Witnesses reported hearing the aircraft making &quot;popping&quot;
noises, The engine manufacturer indicated that an interruption of fuel flow to a
Lycoming 10-720 engine could result in a popping noise or backfiring. At the first indication of abnormal engine operation, the pilot should have
advanced the mixture, prop, and throttle controls to the full rich/high RPM/high manifold
position. Having done so, he may have recognized his fuel inanagement error and
attempted to correct it by turning the fuel boost pumps on and selecting auxiliary fuel. Thv surge or increase in engine power as described by witnesses may have been due to the
resumption of fuel flow to the engines as a result of the pilot&#x27;s selection of auxiliary fuel. The fuel tank selectors and boost pumps were located on the fuel control
panel, which was located approximately 90° to the left and below the pilot&#x27;s view of the
primary flight instruments. Switching tanks would therefore have required the pilot to
move his head down and to the left, thus diverting his attention from flying the aircraft. If, while under actual instrument conditions, the pilot&#x27;s eyes were diverted
from the flight instruments and his head was moved downward and turned (as when
changing frequencies, checking flight log data, or changing fuel selectors), the aircraft
rolled or turned at the same time and he suddenly returned his head to the normal
position, a disorientation would most likely have occurred, A false sensation of diving or
rolling beyond the vertical plane would have been produced. AS a result, there may have
heen a strong, instinctive tencency to pitch or roll the aircraft in the opposite direction.</div>

The Safety Board could not determine the airworthiness of the
aircraft at the time of the accident. The aircraft had landed at Guan
with the No. 2 engine shut down ard the No. 2 propeller feathered. The
maintenance records for the serses of flights that had begun on June 3,
1976, were carried onvoard the aircraft and any discrepancies, ineluc ing
the reason for shutting down the No. 2 engine, could not be determined. However, since the Air Manila mechanics added fluid t&gt; the No. 2 engine/propelier installation through an access panei, the Safety Board
assumed that the No. 2 engine shutdowm was caused by a loss of oil from
the propeller control. This assumption is supported by the fact that
the mechanics cycled the propeller in and out of the feathered position
after fluid had beer added. The Safety board believes that the maintenance records of this
aircraft reveal a pattern that has a bearing on this accident. Beginning
on May 26, 1976, and continuing through the next two flights before the
aircraft departed Manila on the series of flights that culmi:uated in the
crash, each flightcrew hac reported a problem with the No. 3 engine&#x27;s
horsepower output. Although some corrective maintenance was recurded
after each noted discrepancy, the only component change had been the
replacement of the inducer valve on the No. 3 engine. The horsepower
discrepancy continued uncorrected after this component change and on ali
flights before June 4.

The normal procedure for controlling either an improper turbine
inlet temnerature or horsepower output would be to place the temperature
datum control ewitch in either the &quot;NULL&quot; or &quot;OFF&quot; position and control
the fuel metering of the fuel control by throttle movement. Probably
because of the history of this No. 3 engine, this method of thrustoutput control waa being used by the crew on this series of flights. Because the records were destroyed in the crash, the Safety Board could
not determine if there were other problems with the No. 3 engine during
the flights from Manila to Guam and from Guam to Wake on June 3, 1976,
nor the flight from Wake to Guam on June 4, 1976.</div>

impossible to know how much more stress the blades can withstand. There is no better and safer method than to replace the blades

and start anew. It will eiso re necessary that the Continental
Bulletin M68-15 be adhered to - A copy enclosed, This particularly
applies to Part 6-18 which {{s encivsed. Further precaution should

angle of air inflow to the propeller. Another factor which could affect
propeller vibratory stresses is propeller proximity to the fuselage. No dynamic testing relative to this aspect had been conducted on the
DH~-114. 2. ANALYSIS AND CONCLUSIONS Analysis

The crewmembers were qualified and certificated in accordance
with existing regulations. The airplane was maintained in accordance
with an FAA-approved aircraft inspection prograa. The Safety Board concludes from the physical evidence that the
No. 1 propeller of the No. 2 engine separated as a result of multiple
fetigue cracks around the propeller blade shank. These cracks indicate
that re blade had been subjected to abnormal vibrations over a prolonged
period. The hardness and microstructure of the metal was as specified. There was no evidence of mechanical damage or of a material defect in
the area in which tne fracture originated. Previous failures of this
type of blade had been attributed to pressure caused by excessive contact
between the shank clamp and the shank fillet; however, the Safety Board
found no evidence of such »ressure on the hub surface. The surfaces
that could have contacted the clamp were not damaged. The Safety Board could not determine the exact cause of the
abnormal vibrations. However, the vibrat’.ons which are transmitted to
the propeller by excessively worn counterweight pins and bushings in the
engine&#x27;s crankshaft can be supported by the past experience. Although the Safety Board could not determine the past history
ot the failed blade, it is possible that the blade had been installed on
an engine which had counterweight pins and bushings that were worn
beyond acceptable limits and that excessive stresses weve imposed and
caused a crack nucleus in the propeller shank. If this was the case, the crack nucleus should have been found
when the propeller was last overhauled. However, based on its evaluation
of the propeller overhaul facility, the Board believes that it is probable
that facility personnel would have failed to detect the defect during
overhaul,

The carrier had been advised as early as 1970 of the manufacturer&#x27;s
recommendations on operating times between overhauls. The Safety Boara
has found that {{t is not unusual for the carrter and local FAA authorities
to adjust such recommendations to suit both service experience and
economic cons iderat/ons. Since the FAA was aware of the potential hazard to fligirt
which cculd result from noncompliance with the manufacturer&#x27;s recommendations
of 1976, it was incumbent upon them to make this clear to the operator
and rake such recommendations mandatory. The Board believes that the manufacturers of the propeller aid
the engine as well as the respective FAA Region share the responsiblity
for insuring compliance with mandatory inspection and maintenance procedures,
which, to their knowledge, can adversely affect safe flight.</div>

Attn: Mr. Leonard Davis, Chief

This is in response to your referenced letters and is further to

our telephone conversation of Feb. 27, 1975, concerning certain
service difficulties being experienced with the subject propellers
which are used on the Puerto Rico International Airlines’ De Havilland
DH-114-2X aircraft (conversions).

Enclosed for your information is a copy (Item #1) of our Manufacturing
Inspection, AGL-EHM20-48, Service Difficulty Report (Control No. FY75-39),
dated Jan. 14, 1975. This report summarizes the results of the
examination of Hartzell Model V7636D propeller blade, S/d 65230,
submitted by ASJU-255 (Aircraft/ Part Identification and Release

PAA Form 8020-2, Nov. 12, 1974).

The report findings are self-explanatory. In brief, it is indicaved
that the blades failed due to fatigue which originat:d in areas
subjected to fcreign object damage. The blade repairs which were
accomplished were unsuitable, since the damage which remained resulted
in stress raisers thereby contributing to this failure. In reference to your request about the Model V7636D propeller blade,
S/N B73741, failure, which was covered in Service Difficulty Report
No. 08-31-03-940, dated August 31, 1973 (Ref: yous copy of AGL-210

2.1
General
The flightcrew was trained, certificated and qualified to conduct the
flight, and the flight was conducted in accordance with applicable FARs and
company requirements. The flight attendant also was appropriately trained and
qualified. The flightcrew was in good health and held the proper FAA medical
certificates. There was no evidence that the performance of any crew member was
impaired by alcohol, drugs, or fatigue. The airplane was maintained in accordance with applicable FARs and
company Operations Specifications. A review of the airplane’s maintenance
records and operating history did not reveal any maintenance discrepancies or
mechanical anomaly that would have either caused or contributed to the accident. Evidence from the CVR, FDR, and examination of the powerplants,
reduction gear boxes, and propellers indicated that the engines were operating
normally during the flight until the loss of a major portion of one propeller blade
on the left engine. After the propeller blade separation, the combination of the
resulting loss of left engine thrust, increased drag from a deformed engine nacelle
and the three blades retained in the propeller hub, and added frontal drag from
external sheet metal damage, degraded airplane performance, preventing the
flightcrew from arresting the airplane’s descent or making rapid changes in its
direction of flight making a forced landing necessary. The Safety Board concludes
that because of the severely degraded aircraft performance, the flightcrew’s
actions were reasonable and appropriate during their attempts to control and
maneuver the airplane throughout the accident sequence and were not a factor in
this accident.
2.2
Analysis of the Propeller Blade Failure
The Safety Board concludes that one of the four blades from the left
engine propeller separated in flight because a fatigue crack that originated from
multiple corrosion pits in the taper bore surface of the blade spar propagated
toward the outside of the blade, around both sides of the taper bore, then reached
critical size. (See Section 1.16.1.)

Results of investigations conducted in two previous propeller blade
failures in 1994, one in Brazil with this model blade and the other in Canada with
a similar model blade, indicated that corrosion was produced when entrapped
moisture reacted with residual chlorine in a bleached cork used to retain the lead
wool in the taper bore hole of the propeller. The accident blade exhibited a nearly
continuous layer of oxide deposits on the initial 0.049 inch of the crack depth. These deposits contained a substantial amount of chlorine. The Safety Board
found that the ASA propeller blade contained corrosion damage (pitting) in the
taper bore and the oxide layer in the origin area of the fatigue crack in the
separated ASA propeller blade, as did the two previous failed propellers.</div>

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] Although it is not explained in AC 20-66, testing a propeller
blade at its cutoff repair limit is conducted presumably to ensure that the decrease
in blade length does not alter the natural frequency to the extent that a resonant
vibration condition could be entered while operating within the normal rpm range. AC 20-66 considers the expected loss of mass of a metal propeller blade following
blend repair; however, the AC does not consider the expected mass gain with age
of a composite propeller blade. Composite blades may gain mass with age with
the addition of layers of paint, introduction of moisture, and patch repairs. A review of AC 20-66, which includes a detailed discussion of the
propeller vibratory phenomenon, does not explain that a propeller blade’s natural

66
vibratory response varies with varying conditions (i.e. mass gain, mass loss,
variations in airfoil shape, etc.) and that adequate margin from a potentially
coincident excitation frequency should be maintained. Consequently, the Safety
Board concludes that the AC does not provide guidelines for adequate margin
between a propeller blade’s natural frequencies and its potentially coincident
excitation frequencies over the life of the blade. Therefore, the Safety Board believes that the FAA should revise AC
20-66 to include the vibratory testing of composite propeller blades that have been
previously operated for a substantial number of service hours, and composite
blades that have been altered to the limits set forth in FAA-approved repair
manuals to determine the expected effects of age on propeller vibration and
provide guidelines for rpm margin between a propeller blade’s natural frequencies
and the excitation frequencies associated with propeller operation.
2.5
Effect of Blade Failure and Analysis of Terminating Action
The forward half of the fractured front inlet case, found along the
wreckage path, was attached to the reduction gear box (RGB) of the left engine. The RGB case was also fractured, empty of oil, and some internal gearbox
components were missing. The in-flight fracture of the RGB case most likely
resulted in the loss of the gearbox components and the venting liquid reportedly
seen by the passengers. Damage to the forward engine mounts and the front frame of the left
engine nacelle indicated that the propeller RGB first separated upward at the
inboard mount location, followed by the aft and outboard failure at the outboard
mount location. Failure of the engine mounts were the result of overload stresses. The imbalance loads associated with the separated blade on the
accident airplane apparently exceeded the design strength of the RGB attachment
points. In this instance, it appears that the RGB was retained on the airplane in an
outboard displaced position, as observed by the passengers, from the time of
propeller blade separation until the beginning of the initial ground impact. Embraer’s postcertification (September 1984) testing determined that
the nacelle would not withstand a mid-blade or full-blade segment loss. To date,
there have been four blade separations--three from fatigue cracks that initiated in
the taper bore.</div>

Findings
1. 
The flightcrew was trained, certificated and qualified to
conduct the flight, and the flight was conducted in accordance
with applicable Federal Aviation Regulations and company
requirements.
 
2. 
The flightcrew was in good health and held the proper FAA
medical certificates. There was no evidence that the
performance of any crewmember was impaired by alcohol,
drugs, or fatigue.
 
3. 
ASA maintained the airplane in accordance with applicable
Federal Aviation Regulations and company Operations
Specifications.
 
4. 
After the propeller blade separation, the combination of the
resulting loss of left engine thrust, increased drag from a
deformed engine nacelle and the three blades retained in the
propeller hub and added frontal drag from external sheet
metal damage degraded airplane performance preventing the
flightcrew from arresting the airplane’s descent or making
rapid changes in its direction of flight making a forced

5. 
One of the four blades from the left engine propeller
separated in flight because a fatigue crack that originated
from multiple corrosion pits in the taper bore surface of the
blade spar propagated toward the outside of the blade, around
both sides of the taper bore, then reached critical size.
 
6. 
Because of the severely degraded aircraft performance
following the propeller blade separation, the flightcrew’s
actions were reasonable and appropriate during their attempts

76
7. 
Hamilton Standard’s engineering decision to use the PS960A
blending repair to remove ultrasonic indications caused by a
shotpeened taper bore surface was technically reasonable.
 
8. 
The manner in which the unapproved extension of PS960A
was documented and communicated within Hamilton
Standard, and the lack of training on the extension, created
confusion and led to misapplication of the blending repair to
unshotpeened blades with unexplained ultrasonic indications,
allowing the accident blade to be placed back into service
with an existing crack.
 
9. 
The sanding marks left by the PS960A blending repair did not
contribute to the initiation of the fatigue crack in the accident
blade.
 
10. The failure to restore the taper bore surface to the original
surface finish, as required by PS960A, was a factor that
caused the reduction of the ultrasonic indication that allowed
the blade to pass the final ultrasonic inspection and to be
returned to service.
 
11. The borescope inspection procedure developed and used by
Hamilton Standard in June 1994 to inspect returned blades
that had rejectable ultrasonic indications for evidence of
cracks, pits, and corrosion was inadequate and ineffective.

uncontrollable in its pitch and flap axes and free to create an extreme
imbalance in the rotor head. Such imbalance could well have caused the
main rotor head to displace in such a manner as to deflect the other four
rotor blades downward into the front and rear structure of the aircraft,

Based on tests and research, and for the reasons stated above, the
Safety Board concludes that the extreme main rotor blade excursions in
their lead/lag axis occurred first in the sequence resulting from the

initial accident cause, and that the detachment failure of the yellow blade
pitch change control rod resulted from overloads created by the extreme
blade excursions, Based or metallurgical cxaminations, it is further concluded there was no fatigue or material deficiencies involved in the detachment failure; and based on tests and research, the absence of the bearing
cap bolt at the trunnion attachment point did not cause or contribute to

the cause of the yellow pitch rod detachment. The absence of the bearing
cap bolt may have resulted from tts nut being strippcd off during the
extreme loading on the bearing cap, or it may be reflective of a maintenance omission. _

Concluding, for the reasons stated above, that the resulting sequence
of events began with the extreme lead and lag excursions of the main rotor
blades, the Safety Board explored numerous possible reasons for the excursions, Much of the testing and research was directed to this purpose,
and the aircraft manufacturer assisted to a maxinum extent with its factlities and expertise. Considered were the failure of a main rotor blade, the failure or
seizure of the main rotor gearbox, the failure of a main rotor blade
spindle, and the failure of a servo connection, &lt;All of these possibilities
have the potential for creating the excursions; however, they can be dismissed definitively on the physical evidence and metallurgical examination
which clearly showed none of them had cccurred,

Both engines were developing little or no power at impact, with

Suggested the possibility of a total power failure situation in which the
pilot did not lover collective control for autorotatton quickly enough,
This could result in a serious main rotor speed toss and blade stall, thus
causing the extreme lead and lag blade excursions. This possibility was

This could result in a serious main rotor speed toss and blade stall, thus
causing the extreme lead and lag blade excursions. This possibility was
concluded by the Safety Board as being remote for several reasons. Pirst,
there was no evidence of engine malfunction or failure. Each engine has
a separate fuel system, and the pilot who was highly experienced could be
expected to react promptly and efficiently to a power failure, Addi-.
tionally, according to the aircraft manufacturer, a serious blade stall
would result in erratic pitch attitude changes of the aircraft which are
not indicated by ground witness obsevations,

The Safety Board is of the opinion that the lack of engine power
development was most probably the result of the pilots&#x27; reaction to what I
they knew was a most critical situation and to reduce, to the extent possible,
the crash fire hazard. This reason ts supported by the last transmission
From the aircraft, &quot;LA, we&#x27;re crashing... ,. &quot;

There were two severe impact damage marks on the yellow blade at the
junction of its tip cap and blade spar, the cause of which could not be
identified satisfactorily. This gave rise to the possibility that a
foreign object had struck the blade, deflecting it critically or damaging
its pitch control components, However, one damage mark was not considered
of sufficient magnitude to have created a problem and was dismissed as
-incapable of causing a critical failure in the rotor head. The other mark,
because of other impact marks superimposed over it, was considered to have
occurred following separation of pieces of the yellow blade, This latter
mark, altiough severe, did not cause separation of the blade tip cap and.
was, therefore, also considered incapable of causing a critical ¢ontrol
failure of the rotor head, I .

Another possible cause, carefully considered, for the extreme lead ©
and “lag excursions was a malfunction of the AFCS alone, or in conjunction
with a maladjustment of the-AFCS servo, resulting in a forcible hardover

in the yaw, pitch, or rol}} axes of the aircraft, There are several
_ reasons for dismissing this possibility.

_ The primary reason is that any control input to the control system I
affects all five blades nearly simultancously and no one blade alone. This
cannot change if control input was manual or was an input in the form of.
an AFCS forcible hardover from system malfunction or maladjustment, In
‘this accident, the evidence is clear that the yellow blade was out of ‘the
_ rotor disc when the other blades cut into the «front and rear areas of the

would have made both recognition and response more difficult. If the
aircraft entered the stall regime at 150 feet above the runwey, an
accident would have been unavoidable. The left propeller apparently was at or near the feattered
position when the aircraft struck the ground because: (1) The propeller
was rotating slowly or was not rotating at all, (2) the chord line, near
ground level, of the partially buried propeller blade was approximately
aligned with the aircraft&#x27;s impact heading, and (3) there was vo apparent
twisting of the blade in the ground after it had been buried i:*~ the
ground. Although the left propeller biades were founc at a pi:..: angle
of about 21°, the Safety Board believes that the aircraft&#x27;s left rotation
after impact probably rotated the blades frow a near feather angle
(about 80°) to contact with the centrifugal responsive pins before the
propeller broke from its shaft. In fact, the partially buried blade
probably acted as an anchor which, coupled with che aircraft&#x27;s forward
momentum, produced the left turning inoment on the aircraft after impact. Consicering the critical conditions with which the pilot was
faced following failure of the crankshaft, and since he did rot perform
the first item in the engine failure procedure, the Safety Board believes
that the left propeller probably feathered automatically after the

~ 16 =

camshaft broke and disrupted the oil supply to the propeller governor. This disruption probably occurred several seconds after the crankshaft
failed, and, during this time period, the propeller would have windmilled
and would have produced a significant amount of drag. When combined
with the extended landing gear, the aircraft&#x27;s climb capability would
have been reduced sustantially--possibly to as little as a negative 109
fpm at 1]? mph. If the airspeed was less than 117 mph, the rate of
aescent could have been greater. As the propeller moved toward the feather position, it would
have produced less drag, which eventually should have enabled the pilot
to establish a climb even with the landing gear extended if he had
maintained the appropriate airspeed. However, since the aircraft struck
the ground with considerably more force than would have been generated
by a 100 fpm rate of descent, the Safety Board concludes that the pilot
stalled the aircraft in an attempt to maintain altitude and avoid the
ground. This conclusion is confirmed by the short distance the rircraft
traveled after impact, the crushed and flattened unterside of the fuselage
and engines, and the impact damage to the pilots&quot; and passengers‘ seats. The Safety Board is concerned thet such an engine failure can
be catastrophic.</div>

accident illustrates further the need for early accomplishment of these
measures to insure that this critical information is available to all
piiots. 2.2 Conclusions (a) Findings

1. Neither wrather nor air traffic control were
factors in this acciderc.

2. When the aircraft was between 50 and 100 feet
above the runway, its left engine fatled because
the crankshaft broke at the No. 7 crankcheek. The crankshaft broke because a pre-existing
fatigue crack had propagated through the
crankcheek and the cheek could no longer
withstand ncrmal operating stresses. No material defects were found in the crankshaft
that could have contributed to the initiation

of the crack. The reason for the initlation of

the crack was not determined, but it probably was
initiated by a combination of residual stresses and
operating stresses. The right engine continued to function normally
after the left engine fatled. According to performance. charts and flight tests,
the aircraft was cupable of climbing about 300
fre at 117 mph witht one engine inoperative, its
propeller feathered, and the landing gea™ retracted. According to performance charts and fligh* tests,
the aircraft could not maintain level or climbing
flight in the takeoff configuration with one engine
inoperative and its propeller windmilling, and a
descent of 100 to 200 fpm was required to maintain
te: soff airspeed.

Following failure of the left engine, the

pilot lost control of the aircraft because

he permitted the airspeed to decrease below Vee,
and he permitted the aircraft to stall. The pilot did not retract the lending gear
either before or after the engine fatted. The left propeller probably feathered automatically

after the camshaft broke; however, until the propeller
blade angles had increased substantially, the propeller
would have windmilled and would have produced significant
drag. The pilot&#x27;s ability to maintain flight after the
engine failed was marginal beceuse of nix rime
conditions, the aircraft&#x27;s low altitude, and

the aircraft&#x27;s inability to climb or maintain
lev-1 flight in the takeoff configuration with

one engine inoperative and its propeller initially
windmilling. The accident was not survivable because of the
high impact forces generated by the high rate
of descent and the fire that erupted after
impact. (b) Probable Cause

The National Transportation Safety Board determines that
the probable cause of this accident was the sudden failure of the airplane&#x27;s left engine at a point on the takeoff flightpath where the
airplane&#x27;s single-engine performance in the takeoff configuration anu
{{ts height above the ground combined to make the pilot&#x27;s ability vo

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS AND CONCLUSIONS &gt; ANALYSIS] The Safety Board&#x27;s metallurgical tests disclosed no material defects in
the crankshaft, nor did the manufacturer&#x27;s testing produce a probable
operating stress that could have contributed to the initiation of the
fatigue crack. Therefore, the cause of the crack&#x27;s initiation was not
determined. However, because ne metallurgical defects existed, we
believe that the crack probably was initiated by stresses inherent and
applied; that is, by a combination of residual stresses (which probably
were introduced sometime during the manufacturing process) and normal or
cbnormal operating stresses. Although major repairs had been made to the left engine abuut
a year before the accident, there is no evidence that these repairs
affected the condition of the crankshaft. This is because the fatigue
crack originated from a subsurface crea rather than an area that might
have been exposed and damaged during the course of the repair work,

The right engine continued to function properly after the left
engine failed. The ccndition of the right propeller indicates that it
was turning at a relatively high rpm at impact but was not under full
power from the engine. This condition is consistent with the pilot&#x27;s
apparent retention of lateral and directional cuntrol of the aircraft,
whicn struck slightly right-wing low, because he probably reduced power
or the rigiit engine sometime shortly before tryact in an effort to
control the aircraft laterally and directionally.

The exact time at which the crankshaft broke wars not determined. However, since the landing gear apparently remained extended until the
aircraft struck the ground, the crankshaft probably broke before the
pilot normally would have retracted the gear, or when the aircraft was
somewhere between 50 and 100 feet above the runway. Consequently, che
pilot probably was distracted from tnitfally retracting the gear hy the
failure of the left engine. After the engine failed, the pilot apparentiy did not perform
the first item in the &quot;Engine Failure After Lift-Cff&quot; procedure because
the landing gears were extended in the wreckage. It is not known why he
did not retrac® the gears, but under the circumsrances, and where insufficteat
runway remains on which to land the aircraft, an almost instinctive
reaction might have occurred: An immediate atterpt to seek and correct
the cause of the perceived engine malfunction and, in the process, to
increase the aircraft&#x27;s altitude by increasing the rate of climb at the
expense of any ecess airspeed. It is possible that this pilot reacted
in such a@ manner.

(n the other hand, considering (1) the possible elapsed time
between engine failure and impact, (2) the rapid degradation tn airspeed
that occurs after loss of an engine if the landing gear are not retracted,
the propeller feathered, or the pitch attitude decreased, and (3) the
single-engine stall speed of near 90 mph, the pilot had little time or
altitude in which to recognize the problem and respon? with the appropriate
corrective action.</div>

goverrior would have sensed an underspeed condition requiring more fuel to increase and maintain
the RPM. As more fue! was introduced by the underspeed governor, the let propeller would have
produced additional thrust, which in conjunction with the decreasing thrust condition of the right
propeller would have caused the airplane to yaw to the right. Consequently, the Safety Board

believes that the pilot could have been correcting the initial left yaw produced by the right engine
with right rudder and encountered a sudcen yaw to the right in conjunction with a rapid reduction
in airspeed. A reduction in propeller blade angies to the flight idle low pitch stop would not normally occur
in the C-212 until the airspeed is reduced below stall speed and the airplane is on landing rollout. However, a rapid increase in airplane pitch attitude might cause this condition to occur at airspeeds
above the airplane&#x27;s stall speed because the rapid increase in pitch attitude would significantly
increase the angle of attack on the propellers momentarily causing the propeller governors to
rapidly reduce the blade angles in order to maintain constant engine RPM. The rapid reduction in
blade angles coutd, therefore, cause a rapid asymmetric thrust reversal with the left propeller
constrained by the low pitch stop and the right propeller blade angle reduced to a lower thrust
condition. Moreover, forward movement of the Pls under these circumstances, a conditioned response to a
rapid increase in pitch attitude at approach airspeeds, would have aggravated the asymmetric thrust
reversal because with the higher blade angle on the left propeller, it wouid have immediately begun
producing significantly more thrust than the right propeller with its lower flight idle blade angle. In consideration of all the evidence related to the operation, maintenance, and postaccident
condition of the right engine and propeller on the airplane, the Safety Board concludes that the
series of trial-and-error maintenance actions performed during the 3 days preceding the accident
most likely resulted in the misadjustment of propeller’s flight idle low pitch stop to a degree
significantly below the setting prescribed by the manufacturer. Additionally, although the pitot, in
an attempt to salvage approach, flew an unstabilized and steep landiny approach that resulted in a
rapid increase in pitch attitude at a relatively low altitude that may have aggravated the situation by
placing the airplane near an accelerated stall condition, the Safety Board concludes that the pilot&#x27;s
actions probably would have resulted in either a successful flanding or tissed approach had the right
engine and propeller been adjusted properly. finally, the Safety Board concludes that the improper

maintenance performed on the right engine and propeller during the 3 days preceding the accident
relates directly to the cause of the accident.

24 Aircraft Maintenance

The Safety Board&#x27;s investigation disclosed a number of discrepancies in the carrier&#x27;s maintenance
practices. Regarding the maintenance department&#x27;s actions, the Board believes that there was a
failure to troubleshoot the pilot-reported discrepancies correctly. This poor performance led to
unnecessary and time-consuming maintenance tasks that aggravated the carrier&#x27;s maintenance
difficulties. The carrier was averaging about seven flights per day per airplane with most flights
lasting less than 1 hour based on its flight schedule.</div>

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] Therefore, the warning time can be significantly reduced or masked
depending on the particular maneuver and other environme ital conditions. The Safety Board is concerned that the absence of a stall warning device compromises safety in
14 CFR Parts 135 and 121 passenger-carrying operations by placing too much reliance on a
subjectively approved “inherent” buffeting stall warning feature that may be less noticeable during
an emergency or in the presence of atmospheric turbuience. There: ure, the Safety Board believes
that the FAA should reevaluace tive stall warning certification criteria for airplanes used in Parts 135
and 121 air carrier operations with a view toward requiring stall warning devices on these airplanes.

2.3 Asymmetric Power Condition

The Safety Board&#x27;s investigation determined that other factors also contributed to the pilot
losing control of the airplane. Four of the passengers heard unusual engine sounds during the
approach, and two ground witnesses remarked about the sound of the engines. The crop duster
pilot said the sound was similar to the sound of reverse propeller pitch, and it was associated with
the airplane&#x27;s yaw to the right. These observations indicated that the pilot encountered a problem
with an engine or propeller or both. Since no evidence of a failure or malfunction in these
components was found, the Safety Board believes the evidence supports the contention that the

problem was associated with the manner in which the pilot manipulated the PLs, or with rigging of
an engine and propeller controls, or a combination of both. Postaccident metallurgical examination of the pitch change piston from the right propeller
estalished that the initiation of the spiral gouge in the wall of the piston corresponded to @
propeller blade angle of 0°. Consequently, the Safety Board concludes that the blades on the right
propelier were at an angle of 0° when the propeller dome struck the fence and ground. However,
this candition could have been the result of propeller pitch control tinkage distortion when the rigitt
enginw separated trom the wing during the impact sequence, of movernent of the PLs ft into the:
beta mode by the pilot, or of static misadjustment of the law-pitch stop by maintenance personnel. Although the Safety Board cannot exciude crash dynamics as having produced the low-blade
angie on the right propeller, it is of the opinion that distartion of the propeller pitch control linkage
did not occur simultaneously with the availability of oil “low from the engine driven pump through
the propeller governor to the pitch control cylinder at sufficiently high pressure to force the pitch
control piston toward the 0°-blade angle in opposition to feather spring and counterweight forces. Furthermore, unlike the lett engine and propetler which retained its operational integrity for a
comparatively long period during the crash sequence, the right engine and propeller was subjected
to severe impact forces almost immediately after the right wing tip struck the ground. Consequently, even though components of the right engine and propeller could be functionally
tested after the accident, it is probable that the operational integrity of the components was
destroyed iminediately after the right propeller struck the ground.</div>

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] Furthermore, it is apparent that maintenance
personnet attempited to correct the high torque of the right engine by repositioning the beta tube
which would have resulted in a lower flight idle blade angle than specified by the manufacturer. There was no record showing what exactly was done to readjust the blade angle, and there was no
record of a flight idle descent check as required in order to ensure that fuel flows were adjusted
properly. It did not appear that the complete procedure was done after the engine change. The
Safety Board doubts that a thorough flight idle descent check including accurate fuel flow settings
could be accomplished after one 15-minute test flight. It would be highly unlikely to have the fuet
flow set correctly after an engine change on the first attempt without having to make a
readjustment. The Safety Board believes that had maintenance personnel followed the

33

manufacturer&#x27;s procedures properly for establishing the flight idle blade angle and flight idle
descent fuel flow’ for the airplane, the problems would not have occurred. Consequently, the Safety
Board concludes that on the day of the accident, the right engine in the airplane was developing
excessive torque at flight idle and that the flight idle hydraulic stop of the propeller could have been
set significantly tower than the 7° prescribed by the manufacturer. The significance of an abnormally high flight idle fuel flaw on the right engine becomes evident
only when the PLs were retarded to the {{light idle position--a position norrnally used only during
descent and the landing flare Under conditions of equal torque on both engines, the propeller
blade angles would be essentially equa! in response to propeller governor operation to maintain
constant engine RPM. However, when the Pts were retarded to the flight idle position, the right
engine would have produced more torque because of the high flight idle fuel flow, and the airplane
would have yawed to the left towar«! the engine with the lower torque. At airspeeds above about
70 KIAS, the propeller blade angles would have varied in response to propeller governor operation
to maintain constant engine RPM, but the blade angtes on both propellers would have continued to
decrease as airspeed decreased. Under these circumstances, had the left engine propeller contacted
the flight low pitch stop, in effect, it would have become a fixed-pitch propeller while the right
propeller continued to reduce its blade angle in response to decreasing airspeed since the right
propeller could have had ar abnormally low flight idle pitch stop setting. Under these conditions,
the left propeller would have placed a load on the engine, thereby reducing the engine RPM while
the right propeller continued to reduce its blade angle to a lower thrust condition. The left engine
goverrior would have sensed an underspeed condition requiring more fuel to increase and maintain
the RPM. As more fue! was introduced by the underspeed governor, the let propeller would have
produced additional thrust, which in conjunction with the decreasing thrust condition of the right
propeller would have caused the airplane to yaw to the right.</div>

in this accident, in accordance with Mohawk procedures, then 211 associated components functioned satisfactorily at that time, since there
ia no indication to the contrary. Examination of the engines disclosed that the left engine was

axamnined and functionally tested, and both were found capable of normal

control unit feathering lever was moved slowly from the run-auto position into the lockout position while the cruise pitch lock withdrawal

manner in which the power and high-pressure fuel valve levers were
manipulated during the crew&#x27;s attempt to feather the left propeller. Again, however, a datermination of the precise sequence of events which

At some time during the attempte to feather the left propeller,
the cruise pitch lock withdrew, which allowed the blade angle to de«
crease to the 16° position, where it was constrained by the flight fine
pitch lock. Wichdrawal probably was the inadvertent result of the
manner in which the power and high-pressure fuel valve levers were
manipulated during the crew&#x27;s attempt to feather the left propeller.</div>

during a turbine disk overspeed. In addition, the metallurgical examination of the pieces
of the failed disk showed no evidence of preexisting fatigue or cracking and that the
fracture surfaces were consistent with overstress separations. In order for the stage 1 low pressure turbine rotor to have accelerated to the
overspeed condition, it would had to have been free of the torque load of its rotor
assembly. This freedom was accomplished by the failure of some of the 60 bolts which
attached the stage 1 rotor to the stage 2 rotor at the bolted flanges of their spacer arms. Five pieces of foreign material--M-50 alloy steel-- were found in the engine. Three of
these pieces were found in the low pressure turbine&#x27;s stage 2 rotor cavity; two pieces were
found in the engine&#x27;s stage 1 toroid cavity. In addition, the stage 1 to stage 2 bolt heads
were smeared with M-50 alloy steel. This condition indicated that, over a relatively lcag
period, the impingement of this material damaged a sufficient number of these 60 bolts to
destroy the bolts&#x27; capability to hold the stage 1 rotor to the stage 2 rotor. The bolts
failed, the rotors separated, and the stagei rotor was free of its rotor

assembly load. Asa result, the stage 1 rotor disk oversped during the high takeoff power
demand on the engine. The overspeed resulted in tne fragmentation of the rotor disk and
exit of the fragments through the low pressure turbine casing. Consequently, the Safety
Board concludes that the faiture of the stage 1 low pressure turbine rotor disk was caused
by the foreign material in the engine. The five frrngments of M-50 alloy steel found inside the low pressure turbine
module were severely oxidized and battered indicating that they had been exposed to heat
and impact damage for a considerable period. The main engine bearings of the CF6
engine fleet are made with M~50 alloy steel; however, all the main bearings forward of
the low pressure turbine section were undamaged and all the engine bearings’ inner races
were intact. In addition, the part of the low pressure turbine section where these
fragments were found is sealed from the path of gas flow through the engine. Consequently, this material could not have migrated either aft or forward into the low
pressure turbine cavity while the engine was in operation. The evidence appears
conclusive that either these fragments were inside the low pressure turbine module when
it was installed on the engine or they got inside the turbine module the last time it was
disassembled and were not detected during maintenance. Further, the battered condition
of these fragments precluded all attempts to match them with the toois used in the engine
build-up procedure, or with any other type M-50 alloy steel tool, consequently the Safety
Board could not identify the source of these M-50 alloy stee) fragments,

Exainination of the damaged low pressure turbine indicated that the initial
exit of the rotor disk fragments occurred just outboard of the top of the engine.</div>

The stage 1 to stage 2 rotor bolt heads were smeared with this M-50
alloy steel. The failure of the stage 1 to stage 2 rotor bolts and the subsequent
failure of the stage 1 Jow pressure turbine rotor was caused by the
impingement of the pieces of M-50 alloy steel un the rotor bolts. The engine&#x27;s main bearings are inade of M-50 alloy steel. All of the
main engine bearings forward of the low pressure turbine section were
undamaged,

The part of the low pressure turbine cavity where the M-50 fragments
were found is sealed from the path of gas flow through the ngine. The
M-50 fragments could not have migrated either forward or aft into the
low pressure turbine cavity while the engine wus in operation,

The M-50 fragments found inside the low pressure turbine rotor cavities
were not part of this engine. Debris from the stage 1 low pressure turbine rotor disk eut the slat
follow-up cable which connects the inboard slni actuator mechanism to
the servo valve. The right wing outboard slat group was almost
completely retracted as a result of this damage. The Nos. 1 and 3 hydraulic systems were inoperative from lack of fluid. The firewall fuel shut off valve actuating cables and the fire
extinguishing discharge line from the two agent bottles for the No. 3
engine were severed. The No. 3 engine&#x27;s thrust lever control cable was
severed. All three generator AC buses and all TR buses remained powered. The
stall warning systems and flight director systems remained operative. V2 speed was 6 KIAS faster than the slats retracted stall speed. Had the
engine failure occurred at or after V1 speed, the flighterew should have
been able to continue the takeoff safely. The DC-10-30 cngine installation configuration and its leading edge wing
slat system were certified in accordance with the applicable regulations
and Special Conditions. The present certification regulations do not establish precise standards
and guidelines for analyzing the effects of an uncontained rotor burst. 3.2 Probable Cause

68 3. CONCLUSIONS Findings

I. I N86SD was operated as a public use airplane by the State of
South Dakota, and, therefore, its maintenance and «ne training of
its pilets were not required to conform to Federal Aviation
Regulauons. The pilots were trained and the airplane was
maintained in accordance with current State of South Dakota
and manufacturer guidelines, and these guidelines conformed to
current Federal Aviation Regulations.

2. During cruise flight at FL 240, a propeller hub arm on the left
propeller failed, releasing the propeller blade attached to that
hub arm. The released blade struck the following propeller
blade and broke the tip off the following blade.

3. Severe engine vibration, caused by the missing propeller blade,
caused an autonomous left engine shutdown.

4, During the event, the left engine was forced downward and
inboard on its mounts. One or more of the remaining propeller :
blades, and/or a released blade tip from one of the remaining :
propeller blades, might have contacted the fuselage, causing a
cabin decompression.

5S. A lack of damage to the released propeller blade indicated that it
did not contact the fuselage.

6. During a previous blade release on an MU-2B-60, the pilot was I
unable to arrest his descent. ‘The damaged propeller on his My
airplane was feathered, and the failed engine nacelle was not I
canted away from the relative wind. 7

7. Due to drag caused by displacement of the left engine, sheet I
metal damage, and the loss cf thrust of the left engine, the I
airplane was incapable of maintaining level flight. ,

The left propeller was last overhauled on September 11, 1990, in
accordance with Hartzell procedures, at 3,914 hours of airframe
total time, 671 hours before the accident. The failure of the hub arm was the resu!t of fatigue cracking that
initiated from multiple initiation sites on the inside diameter
surface of the hole for the pilot tube. The fatigue propertics of the hub were substantially reduced by a
combination of factors, including machining marks or scratches,
mixed microstructure, corrosion, decarburization, and residual
stresses, and cracking would not have initiated if the properties
had not been reduced. Based on the stress levels associated with the reactionless mode
and the propensity of MU-2B airplanes to experience the
reactionless mode at or above the ground idle RPM, the fatigue
fracture of the hub is more likely to have initiated as a result of
increased cyclic stresses produced during the reactionless mode
of vibration, in combination with the substantially reduced
fatigue properties of the hub material. The precautions taken during the initial certification that were
intended to minimize the exposure of propellers on MU-2B
airplanes to the reactionless mode of vibration were inadequate.</div>

intended to minimize the exposure of propellers on MU-2B
airplanes to the reactionless mode of vibration were inadequate. There was no routine or special inspection in place at the time of
the accident that were designed to detect the fatigue crack that
precipitated the loss of the propeller blade. Subsequent to the
accident, efforts to develop a practical, nondestructive test,
without the removal of the pilot tubes to detect such an anomaly,
were unsuccessful. The pilots acted in a reasonable manner in continuing the high
rate of descent to lower altitudes; and, once at lower altitudes,
they continued to fly at higher airspeeds and rates of descent to
gain more aerodynamic control.

10

15. Following the event, the flightcrew asked for &quot;the closest
airport.&quot; The controllers offered the single option of ILSequipped DBQ, 37 miles away from the airplane. At that time,
ILS-equipped CWI was 9 miles away, and ILS-equipped MLI
was 39 miles away. However, under all of these circumstances,
this option was appropriate.

16. ARTCC sector positions of operation do not have the capability
of displaying several hourly weather sequence reports at a tiine,
being automatically updated, and being displayed at all times the
sector is in operation.

17. The Emergency Assistance section of the Air Traffic Control
handbook did not address the issue of finding the best possible
weather for an IFR aircraft in an emergency status. 3.2 Probable Cause

The National Transporation Safety Board determines that the probable
cause of this accident was the fatigue cracking and fracture of the propeller hub arm. The resultant separation of the hub arm and the propeller blade damaged the engine,
nacelle, wing, and fuselage, thereby causing significant degradation to aircraft
performance and control that made a successful landing problematic. The cause of the propeller hub arm fracture was a reduction in the
fatigue strength of the material because of manufacturing and tirne-related factors
(decarburization, residual stress, corrosion, mixed microstructure, and
machining/scoring marks) that reduced the fatigue resistance of the material,
probably combined with exposure to higher-than-normal cyclic loads during
operation of the propeller at a critical vibration frequency (reactionless mode),
which was not appropriately considered during the airplane/propeller certification
process.

                        <div class="chunk-text">[CONCLUSIONS] There was no evidence of factors which would have detracted
from the pilot&#x27;s physical ability to operate the aircraft. The aircraft was properly certificated and was maintained in
accordance with approved maintenance procedures; however,
inadequate maintenance was performed during replacement of the
No. 5 cylinder of the left engine 4 days before the accident. The left engine turbocharger was malfunctioning before the
accident. The turbocharger failed as a result of an imbalance and ceased
operating after liftoff. A portior of the fractured exhaust valve guide from the No. 5
cylinder probably damaged the turbocharger&#x27;s turbine wheel
blades before the cylinder was replaced 4 days before the
accident. The left engine sustained a substantial loss of power because the
turbocharger ceased operating. The propeller was capable of
normal operation. The right engine and propeller were capable of normal operation. The teft propeller, which was capable of normal operation, showed
minimal evidence of rotation at impact and was transitioning to
the feather position during the impact sequence. The right propeller was in the low pitch position and was
producing power at impact. The aircraft&#x27;s climb oerformance was very inarginal because of
the high density altituce conditions and gross weight at takeoff. The pilot failed to feather the propeller in a timely manner and
did net establish the aircraft in a minimum drag attitude
following the power loss. The required sideslip technique used in engine-out procedures may
not have been emphasized in the ptlot&#x27;s flight training.

14... The horizontal and vertical peak crash loads were estimated to be
within the limits of human tolerance.

15. There were no apparent seat or restraint system failures.
16. The fuel tanks ruptured during principal tree impact.

17. The fuel dispersed on impact and was probably ignited by hot
engine components which caused an intense postimpact fire.

18. There were no significant traumatic injuries.

19. The cause of deeth of all occupants was attributed to burn injuries
due to the intense posterash fire.

3.2 Prodabie Cause

The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable
cause of the accident was a substantial loss of power from the left engine at a
critical point in the takeoff and the failure of the pilot to establish a minimum
drag configuration which degraded the marginal single-engine climb performance
of the alecraft. The loss of power resulted from seizure of the turbocharger
fottowing progressive failure of the turbine wheel blades initiated by foreign object
ingestion which had occurred previous to this flight and was not detected during
maintenance on the engine 4 days before the accident.

4, RECOMMENDATIONS

As a result of this investigation, the Safety Board reiterates Safety
Recommendation A-79-80 which was issued to the FAA on May 17, 1978:

Require that pilots Involved in 14 CFR 135 operations be
thoroughly trained on the performance capabilities and
handling qualities of aircraft when loaded to their maximum
certificated gross weight or to the limits of their e.g.
envelope, or both.</div>

have seriously Bffected his control of a barely manageable situation. Failure to
feather the propeller under the conditions would have produced the greatest
degradation in climb performance. An angle of bank of more than 5° in either
direction would have also degraded the climb performance significantly. Since only
a small reduction in power below a normally aspirated engine condition would have
caused more drag than thrust, the pilot may have observed what he believed to be
sufficient power indications on the manifold and rpm gages for him to attempt to

og regain full power from the engine. However, under the circumstances, the
aad propeller would have been producing more drag than thrist, which probably we- not

E fully appreciated by the pilot. It is also believed that the importance of
establishing the aircraft in the required sideslip attitude may not have been
stressed during the pilot&#x27;s training. The evicence suggests that the pilot did not
feather the propeller in time and did not exercise the precise control necessary to
obtain the available performance of the aircraft, probably because of distractions
associated with his attempts to regain full power from the engine. Therefore,
considering the significant climb degradations of a partially windmilling propeller
and drag due to sideslip, a failure to feather the propeller and establish the
necessary sideslip attitude in a timely manner made this accident inevitable. Notwithstanding the above circumstances, the Safety Board believes that the
pilot&#x27;s ability to sustain flight was marginal and, therefore, had he been more
timely in his actions, it is not certain that an accident would have been avoided. In view of the very marginal single-engine climb performance available
under the conditions of the accident and the precise flying necessary to achieve
this performance, the Safety Board, in summary, reiterates its conclusions

previously reported in a special study 2/--that at the present time light twinengine safety during critical engine failure situations depends almost exclusively
upon pilot proriciency. The pilot&#x27;s ability to immediately assess the situation and
react instinctively in a correct manner is the level of safety factor upon which the
public is dependent in most part 135 operations. In this regard, pilot training
cannot be overemphasized. This accident and another which occurred on March 1,
1979, 3/ underscore the need for operators to carefully evaluate the proficiency of
all pilots in their employ who nave not had previous training and experience in
twin-engine propeller driven aircraft. This fact alone, considering his previous
military experience, might explain why the pilot did not instinctively react in the
proper manner. The Safety Board also recognizes the criticality of single-engine
training in these types of aircraft and, believes that the greatest potential for
prevention of these types of accidents ‘Is in the area cf increased’ single-engine
performance of light twin-engine aircraft. The available evidence indicates that the structural crashworthiness of
the aircraft was not compromised during the impact sequence and that there
remained adequate occupiable space for all occupants. The seats and restraint
systems appeared to have remained intact and should have provided restraint for
all occupants.

Although the niaintenance personnel stated that the lower portion cf the fractured valve guide was not removed from the cylinder, they were not able to confirm that it remained in the cylinder head. Because of the severe sideplay in the exhaust valve, the fracture of the valve guide, and the damaged cylinder boss area which surrounded the exhaust valve, the Safety Board concludes that the lower pvstion of the guide was missing before the No, 5 cylinder was removed from the engine.

postimpact positions of the throttle, mixture, and propeller lever, as well as the
propeller governor operating arm of the left engine, are evidence that, at sore
point, he deliberately shut down the left engine and feathered its propeller. The
two impact marks on the butt face of one propeller blade showed, however, that
the left propeller blades were transitioning to the feather position at the time of
the crash. Therefore, it is believed that the pilot waited until seconds before
impact to feather the propeller. He also closed the emergency fuel shutoff valves
before impact. Under the high density altitude conditions existing at the time of the
accident and at an assumed airspeed of 105 KIAS, @ well-tuned engine with an

inoperative turbocharger would have produced about 155 shaft horsepower at
19 inches of manifold pressure and 2,135 rpm; the propeller blade angle would have
been 17.7° Since the low pitch stop is set at 16.6°, the propeller blades would have
been about 1° from the stop, and the constant speed features of the propeller would
have caused the blades to move to the low pitch stop in the event cf a further loss
of power or airspeed. The burning of oil and a rich fuel/air mixture in the left
engine supports a conclusion that power was substantially reduced below the above
values which resulted in more drag than thrust from the left propeller. Consequently, the aircraft&#x27;s climb capability was degraded significantly because of
the drag associated with the unfeathered propeller. In the event of engine roughtiess, the AFM directs the pilot to reduce
“ power and analyze the condition before immediately feathering the propeller. A
og reduction of power to idle in this case would have produced &amp; maximum windmilling
4 propeller, and the aircraft&#x27;s climb would have been degraded by 350 feet per
minute, resulting in a minimum rate of descent of at least 190 feet per minute. Additionally, if the pilot used the sea level single-engine best rate of climb speed
(V___) of 109 knots, mentioned in the AFM, he would have further degraded the
el performance. The correct speed under the accident conditions was 99 knots. According to the AFM, at this speed, the aircraft would have climbed at 160 feet
per minute, provided the aircraft was in a near zero sideslip attitude with the
4 propeller feathered. This rate, however, results in a less than 1° climb gradient. To achieve even a margiral climb capability, the pilot had to
immediately feather the malfunctioning engine, establish a zero sideslip attitude,
and fly at a V._. of 99 knots. Mismanagement of any one of these factors would
have seriously Bffected his control of a barely manageable situation. Failure to
feather the propeller under the conditions would have produced the greatest
degradation in climb performance. An angle of bank of more than 5° in either
direction would have also degraded the climb performance significantly.</div>

torque with the removal of fuel heat, it seems apparent from the CVR transcript that he
did not do so at the time, and, therefore, did not attempt to restore fuel heat. The
captain stated that he sensed the loss of torque at the same time the first officer noticed
the low torque indication. This also tends to associate the power loss with the removal of
fuel heat. The captain stated that when the engine did not respond to throttle movement, 4

he decided to feather the propeller because he believed that the airplane was in a good 7
position to continue the approach on one engine. It is possible that, with the torque below
50 psi, the captain advanced the throttle to the 12,800-rpm position and the propeller
autofeathered. However, because he decided to feather and carried out the manual
feathering procedure, the crew may not have been aware that autofeatner had occurred. Because no discrepancies were found in the engine or in the crew&#x27;s actions
before the loss of power, the Safety Board concludes that the loss of power in the right =
engine occurred due to the freezing of fuel-entrained water in the low-pressure filter a
after the fuel heaters were turned off in accordance with the before-landing checklist.

2.4 Loss of No. 1 (Left) Engine Power

The CVR transcript indicated that only about 28 seconds elapsed between the
time the crew noted the loss of torque on the right engine and the popping sounds and
smell of smoke that indicated the failure of the No. t {{left}} engine. The failure of the left
engine w:.3 caused by the severe overtemperature of the turbine, which can occur when
excessive fuel flow is admitted to the combustors with insufficient airflow through the
engine for proper cooling. The two most likely reasons for a turbine overtemperature are
(1) an attempt at engine acceleration from a relatively low engine seed with the
propeller cruise pitch stop not withdrawn, or (2) 4 large fluctuation in fuel flow from the
fuel control caused by ice in the fuel control servo system.

~] 3-

If the cruise pitch stop is not withdrawn, the propeller blade angle cannot go
below 27.5°. A blade angle of 27.5° will produce too great a load for the engine to
accelerate rapidl; from low power. Therefore, when fuel flow is increased for
acceleration, engine rotor speed does not increase. Without an inerease in engine rotor
speed, the airflow is inadequate for cooling, and turbine overtemperature will occur. During the descent and approach, the power setting had been maintained
constant while the airplane was leveled at 1,800 feet und the airspeed was decreasing
from 200 knots. The propeller manufacturer calculated that the blade angle would have
been 29° at 1,800 feet at that power setting and 165 knots. Therefore, as airspeed
decreased, the blade angle would have been above 29.5° and decreasing with the airspeed.</div>

noticed on the right engine, the airspeed was 188 knots and feathering was completed by
about 170 knots. The blade angles would have been greater than 29.5° at these airspeeds
and the stop would not have been withdrawn. Although the crew stated that they believed that the first officer had placed
the high-pressure cocks in the high stop withdrawal position, the Safety Beara could not
confirm by other evidence the actual position of the high-pressure cocks or the cruise
pitch stops, If the high-pressure cocks had not been placed in the high stop withdrawal ;
position, then the stops would have withdrawn only when both propellers werc below 29.5°, =
or when the left propeller was below 29.5° and the right propeller was feathered. 3
Therefore, under these conditions the overtemperature of the left engine could have
occurred only if the captain had advanced the left throttle at the same time the right Poe
propeller was moving to the feather position. The captain states that he could not )
remember if the throttle was moved immediately after he initiated the feather procedure,
or after the propeller was feathered. SY SENT EN SI BES SRY Ma SP

However, if the high-pressure cocks had been placed in the high stop
withdrawal position before fuel heaters were turned off, the left propeller cruise pitch
stop should have withdrawn as the blade angle decreased to 29.5°, regardless of the pitch
angle of the right propeller. If this were the case, and in the absence of any malfunction
or discrepancy in the propellers or propeller control units, the overtemperature of the
left-engine turbine could have occurred only because of excessive fuel flow for some
; other reason. It has been shown by previous tests by the manufacturer that water in the
. fuel that freezes in the fuel contro! servo system ean cause large fuel flow fluctuations. If the orifices or screens in the servo system were blocked, moving the throttle would
cause fuel pump output flow to increase, but the servo signal would be prevented from
balancing the fuel pump output with reference to throttle position.</div>

condition, he is not in a position to recognize that the rate of airspeed increase is the
result of an increasing headwind as well as the airplane&#x27;s Inertial acceleration. He
responds to the airspeed to achieve liftoff and achieve his normal initial climb pitch
attitude. Thus, the airplane is not likely to attain a performance margin during takeoff
into a downburst or microburst to cushion the effect of downdraft and headwind loss. The
slower the entry airspeed the longer the exposure to downdraft, and the more significant
the angle of attack change resulting from the combined downdraft and headwind loss. The
magnified aerodynamic performance penalty combined with the absence of altitude
available for recovery present an extremely severe hazard. If the airplane is theoretically
capable of maintaining level flight during the microburst penetration, the avoidance of
ground impact is contingent upon rapid recognition of the situation and reaction by the
pilot. It would necessitate a rapid pitch change to a perhaps unaccustomed attitude to
immediately decrease the airplane&#x27;s descent flightpath angle. There are several factors to consider when evaluat’: g the pilot&#x27;s performance
in such a situation. First, the pilot of an airplane taking off in the outflow of a downburst
or microburst is less likely to recognize that he is encountering such a phenomena than a
pilot approaching this condition in other phases of flight where outflow entry effects
would be more apparent. Second, the airplane is trimmed for takeoff so that the
aerodynamic forces developed by the wing and horizontal stabilizer balance the airplane&#x27;s
weight at the normal takeoff and climbout airspeeds with minimal forces required on the
pilots control column. As the airplane lifts off in the outflow and approaches the
downflow area of the microburst, it experiences a decrease In the horizontal headwind
overlayed by an increasing downdraft. The resultant reduction in airspeed and angle of
attack caused by the effects of the decreasing headwind and increasing downdraft reduces
the aerodynamic forces acting on the wing and initially produces a pitchup caused by the
longitudinal stability of the airplane. Ultimately, the force imbalance causes the airplane
to descend, and as the horizontal wind change is encountered beyond the center of the
microburst (an increasing tailwind), the resulting loss of airspeed would continue to cause
the airplane to descend and pitch down until enough lift foree was produced to restore the
vertical force balance. Theoretically, airspeed acceleration, because of the descending
flightpath, would restore the force balance at the trim angle of attack and eventually
result In a restoration of the climbing flightpath. However, on takeoff or final approach,
it is unlikely that enough altitude is available for such a self-corrected flightpath change
to be completed. Therefore, to avoid or minimize altitude loss near the ground, the pilot
must recognize the reduction in airspeed and the pitching tendency of the airplane
immediately and apply back forces on the contro}} column to rotate the afrplane to the
higher than normal pitch attitude. Furthermore, if the pilot does not react immediately and the descent fs
permitted to develop, even greater corrective actions will be needed to develop a positive
load factor to arrest the descent.</div>

from the application of the equation of continuity constraint. Since the application of
this constraint produced downdraft speeds that were substantially less at 100 feet AGL
than the downflow speed reflected in case Il, the Safety Board&#x27;s determination that the
envirormental wind conditions of case I did not exceed the airplane&#x27;s performance
capabilities is equally, if not more, applicable to the horizontal and vertical wind speeds
reflected in the Pan Am and NOAA microburst windfields,

There is tangible evidence which appears to substantiate the airplane&#x27;s
theoretical capability to negotiate the derived environmental conditions. The swath
through the two groups of trees at the impact site indicated that at impact Clipper 759
was in tevel flight or na slight climb. The evidence also showed that during the last 5 to
6 seconds before impact, Clipper 7§9&#x27;s airspeed had increased 18 KIAS. Had the pilot
been able to recognize and react to the changing flight path immediately, this increase in
kinetic energy might have been used to decrease the rate of descent and perhaps level the
airplane more quickly. The swath through the two groups of trees also indicated that the pilot may
have recognized the wind shear but too late to avold the trees; however, the fact that the
wind shear was encountered immediately after takeoff and during the initial climb made
it more difficult for the pilot to detect the wind shear. Normelly during the passage
through a downburst or microburst, the airplane will first encounter an increasing
headwind, a downdraft, and then a loss of headwind (or a sudden tallwind). An airplane
which approaches a microburst or downdraft either during cruise flight or during an
approach to landing is generally in stable flight conditions when the phenomena is
encountered; f.e., the airplane&#x27;s flight attitude and airspeed are stabilized. Under these
flight conditions, the changes in airspeed, pitch attitude, and performance produced by
the airplane&#x27;s passage through the divergent windflow would be more apparent to the pilot
than they would be immediately after takeoff and during initial climb. During takeoff,
the airplane is accelerating to reach the minimum level of performance to initiate flight. The pilot&#x27;s actions are predicated upon his reaching target airspeed values. Under this

condition, he is not in a position to recognize that the rate of airspeed increase is the
result of an increasing headwind as well as the airplane&#x27;s Inertial acceleration. He
responds to the airspeed to achieve liftoff and achieve his normal initial climb pitch
attitude. Thus, the airplane is not likely to attain a performance margin during takeoff
into a downburst or microburst to cushion the effect of downdraft and headwind loss.</div>

~§2-

Present generation flight directors provide the pilot pitch command guidance
to either a fixed takeoff attitude, as is the case with most older jet transport airplanes
such as the B727 involved in this accident, or an optimum climb airspeed, as is the case
with the newer wide-body airplanes, In either system, the pitch command guidance is not
programmed to account for the environmental wind condition experienced in a cownburst
or microburst. These flight directors will in fact provide takeoff and initial climb pitch
commands which are likely to produce a descending flightpath as the airntane experiences
a downdraft and loss of headwind, The Board believes that the FAA and industry should
expedite the development and installation of a flight direction system such as
MFPD-delta-A which includes enhanced pitch guidance logic which responds to inertial
speed/airspeed changes and ground proximity. Although the Safety Board notes that most air carriers including Pan Am
provide pilots with wind shear penetration demonstrations during their recurrent simulator
training, there does not appear to be a consistent syllabus which encompasses microburst
encounters during all critical phases of flight. Because of the differences in airplane
configuration, performance margins, flight director logic, among others, the Board
believes that flighterews should be exposed to simulated microburst encounters during
takeoff as well as approach phases of flight. Effect of reny Rain on Airplane Airfotlls.--The effects of heavy rain on
airfoils still must be verified. The two most significant penalties postulated in the theory
are the momentum penalty and the lift and drag penalties resulting from the formation of
wing roughness. According to the senior research scientist, the momentum penalty
becomes significant at rainfall rates approaching 500 mm/hr; the onset of &quot;sipiificant&quot;
roughness penalties would occur at about 150 mm/hr.

                        <div class="chunk-text">[CONCLUSIONS] The
microburst touched down just north of the DFW Airport. The center of
the microburst was 12,000 feet (1.97 nmi) north of the approach end of
runway 17L and about 1,000 feet west of the extended centerline of the
runway and the ground track of flight 191.

5. The microburst diameter was 3.4 kilometers. The horizontal wind shear
across the microburst was at least 73 knots, and the maximum updraft
and downdraft were 25 fps (4.8 knots) and 49 fps (29 knots), respectively.

6. There were six distinct reversals of vertical wind components along the
southern side of the microburst. The presence of this type of -wind flow
showed that vortices had formed along the boundary between the
descending air and the ambient environment.

7. Flight 191 penetrated the microburst and the vortex flow in the southern
side of the microburst.

8. The first officer successfully transited the first part.of the microburst
encounter by rotating the airplane above a 15° nose-up pitch attitude and
by increasing engine thrust to almost takeoff power. .

9, © About’ 1805:35, 17 seconds before initial impact, the airplane
encountered rapid reversals in the lateral, horizontal, and vertical winds
causing the stickshaker to activate. The first officer exerted a 20- to
25-pound push foree on the control eolumn in -response ‘to the
stickshaker.

21. The flight director was placed in TOGA mode during the initiation of a
missed approach 7 seconds before initial touchdown. The flight
director&#x27;s TOGA mode does not command the optimum pitch attitudes
required to transit a low-altitude wind shear. However, the Safety Board
could not determine whether the first officer was following the pitch
commands provided by the flight director&#x27;s TOGA mode during the final
7 seconds of the flight. The first officer exerted a 20- to 25-pound pull force on the control
column in order to avoid ground contact. The stickshaker activated
momentarily, and the first officer relaxed the pull foree on the control
column, which made ground contact inevitable. Delta 191 touched down softly and almost avoided ground contact. The ATC controller&#x27;s speed adjustment procedures were not causal to the
accident. ,

The 3 nmi separation standard was not maintained between flight 191
and the preceding Learjet. The loss of separation did not contribute to
the accident. The Feeder East and Arrival Radar-1 controllers provided flight 191 with

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] Flight 191 encountered the

-horthern edge of the outflow at 1805:14 when its headwind component began increasing
rapidly. At 1805:14, the ATC radar plot showed flight 191 was about 9,900 feet from the
- first touchdown point and about 11,300 feet from State Highway 114. Since witness
statements indicated the precipitation did not reach the highway until after flight 191
went across it, and since flight 191 was still within the outflow at first impact, the Safety
Board concludes that the southern edge of the outflow was between the first impact point
-and the highway and about 11,000 feet from the northern edge of the outflow. ,

The wind field showed that flight 191 flew through the outflow of a
thunderstorm. The horizontal dimensions of the outflow were about 11,000 feet
(3.4 kilometers) and since the airplane&#x27;s track passed close to the center of the outflow,
the diameter of the outflow, assuming symmetry, was also about 3.4 kilometers. Based on
its size, this outflow can be classified as a microburst. The vertical winds affecting.the

flight included a maximum downdraft of 49 fps, which occurred at 590 feet AGL followed _

at 560 feet AGL by the maximum updraft of 25 fps. Within the next 8 seconds, the
airplane experienced a 22-fps downdraft, a 16-fps. updraft, a 42-fps downdraft, and a
18-fps updraft. The evidence indicates that flight 191 entered the microburst at 1805:14 and
crashed at 1805:52. During that 38 seconds, it encountered a horizontal wind shear of
about 72 knots. In addition, the six rapid reversals of vertical winds and the 20° rightwing-down roll during the final portion of the descent showed that the airplane penetrated
a vortical wind flow.

&#x27; The LLWAS.--The Safety Board considered the possibility that the LLWAS did
not function properly and that, given the location of the microburst, its alarm should have
sounded earlier. ve

The LLWAS was recertified the morning after the accident. In addition,
beginning August 12, 1985, and over the next 6 weeks, the wind velocity-measuring
- components of all the LLWAS&#x27;s wind sensors were checked and recalibrated where
required. All of the boundary-located sensors were found to be accurate. The centerfield
sensor&#x27;s wind direction-measuring components were accurate, but the sensor&#x27;s speedmeasuring components read 4 knots low; therefore, the LLWAS was more sensitive in
computing any wind shear alarm. Since the centerfield sensor was reading 4 Knots low, a
lesser magnitude of wind at the two northern sensors was required to produce the 15-knot
vector difference required to place the system into alarm. The LLWAS did go into alarm after flight 191 crashed.</div>

controllers. The LCE controller observed lightning about or shortly after the time
flight 191 entered the microburst windfield. Therefore, the failure of
the LCE controller to report it to flight 191 was not a causal factor. .

The flightecrew and the captain had sufficient information to assess the
weather north of the approach end of runway .17L... The lightning
observed and reported by the first officer was adequate, combined with
the other data known to the flightcrew and captain, to determine that
there was a thunderstorm between the airplane-and the airport...

The north side of the cell formation containing the thunderstorm was not
masked from flight 191 by any intervening clouds. The captain&#x27;s decision to continue beneath the thunderstorm did not
comply with Delta&#x27;s weather avoidance procedures; however, the
avoidance procedures did not address specifically thunderstorm
avoidance in the airport terminal area. After penetrating the first part of the microburst, the engine thrust
which had been increased was then reduced and at 550 feet AGL the

airplane -had restabilized momentarily on the glide slope. The captain

evidently believed that they had successfully flown through the worst: of
the mieroburst wind shear, and the approach was continued. me

22. The company had not provided guidance to its flighterews concerning
specific limits on the excursions of airplane performance and control
parameters during low-altitude wind shear encounters that would dictate
the execution of a missed approach.

23. Although the captain did not audibly express his decision to execute a
missed approach until he ealled for the selection of the &quot;TOGA&quot; mode on
the flight director 7 seconds before initial impact, maximum engine
thrust had been applied before the airplane&#x27;s rapid departure below the
glideslope.

24. The accident was not survivable for persons seated forward of row 40
although 8 persons seated forward of the row survived. The accident was
survivable for persons located aft of row 40 and seated in the center and

-right row of seats.

25. Despite notification and coordination difficulties, the emergency
response of the DPS personnel and equipment to the accident scene was
. timely and effective and contributed significantly to saving the lives of 4

- number of the survivors.

3.2 - Probable Cause

The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable causes
of the accident were the flightcrew&#x27;s decision to initiate and continue the approach into a
cumulonimbus cloud which they observed to contain visible lightning; the lack of specific
. guidelines, procedures, and training for avoiding and escaping from low-altitude wind
shear; and the lack of definitive, real-time wind shear hazard information. This resulted
in the aircraft&#x27;s encounter at low altitude with a microburst-induced, severe wind shear
from a rapidly developing ‘thunderstorm located on the final approach course.</div>

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] As the airplane descended through about 800 feet m.s.1., the
airspeed began to rise and the descent rate reduced. The airspeed rose from a stabilized
level of 135 knots to about 143 knots in 4 seconds, after which it decreased to a low value
of 119 knots within the next 12 seconds. The airplane remained leve] about 120 feet
above the ground as the speed decayed. The Safety Board concludes that the increase in
airspeed and the reduction in the descent rate as the airplane reached 800 feet m.s.1. was
caused by the encounter with the outflowing winds from the center of the microburst. As
the airplane continued to penetrate the divergent wind field, it encountered a sudden wind
shift from the airplane&#x27;s nose to its tail. The sudden reduction in the headwind component
produced the airspeed loss. The longitudinal stability characteristics of an airplane encountering these
conditions would cause the airplane to pitch nose down and accelerate to regain the
’ neutral trim airspeed. The pitch-down tendency must be countered by pilot force exerted
to the control column and possibly pitch trim changes if the wind shear is to be penetrated
without a significant loss of altitude. In fact, the procedures recommended for pilots
upon a sudden inadvertent entry into a microburst-type wind shear during approach (below
500 feet) includes the immediate advancement of power to a maximum thrust level and
the initiation of go-around procedures. The fact that Flight 183 remained at a nearly
level altitude as the airspeed decayed showed that the captain did respond appropriately
with the increasing pitch-up control forces necessary to prevent a continuing descent. Further, the power increase noted by the flight attendants and passengers and the airplane
configuration when it struck the ground are compatible with the captain&#x27;s action to
initiate a missed approach. The Safety Board could not determine precisely when the
go-around was initiated in the sequence of events as indicated by the UFDR data. However, it is evident that the airplane did not achieve a positive rate of climb even with
maximum power. A DC9 under the existing conditions of weight, configuration, and
density altitude should have been capable of a level flight inertial acceleration of about
3.9 knots per second with maximum power. Under a stable wind condition, this inertial
acceleration would be reflected directly in an equivalent increase in airspeed. However,
the airspeed actually decreased at about 2 knots per second, indicating that the
longitudinal component of the wind along the airplane&#x27;s flightpath was changing at a rate
about 2 knots per second greater than the airplane&#x27;s longitudinal acceleration capability. Thus, the actual wind change acting on the airplane could have been as much as 6 knots
per second over a 10- to 12-second period. The wind velocities necessary to produce such
a change are not unusual in microburst conditions.</div>

While the Safety Board believes strongly that the most positive
prevention of this type of accident is avoidance of critical microburst
encounters, other actions must be taken to enhance the capability of
flighterews who may experience the hazard without warning to recover
from the encounter. The airplane&#x27;s flight instrumentation must be
improved. In addition, the contents and scope of present simulator
training must be broadened to increase the flightcrew&#x27;s knowledge of the
airplane&#x27;s flight characteristics during varied wind shear encounters so
that they can recognize the onset of the wind shear more quickly and
also recognize the need to take rapid corrective action in order to
prevent a critical loss of altitude. Both of these actions could
effectively improve pilot response time and may mean the difference
between a catastrophic accident and successful microburst penetration. Present generation flight directors provide the pilot pitch
command guidance to either a fixed takeoff attitude, as is the case with
most older jet transport airplanes such as the B727 involved in this
accident, or an optimum climb airspeed, as is the case with the newer
wide-body airplanes. In either system, the pitch command guidance is
not programmed to account for the environmental wind condition
experienced in a downburst or microburst. These flight directors will in
fact provide takeoff and initial climb pitch commands which are likely to
produce a descending flightpath as the airplane experiences a downdraft
and loss of headwind. The Board believes that the FAA and industry
should expedite the development and installation of a flight direction
system such as MFD-delta-A which includes enhanced pitch guidance
logic which responds to inertial speed/airspeed changes and ground
proximity. Although the Safety Board notes that most air carriers including
Pan Am provide pilots with wind shear penetration demonstrations during
their recurrent simulator training, there does not appear to be a
consistent syllabus which encompasses microburst encounters during all
critical phases of flight. Because of the differences in airplane
configuration, performance margins, flight director logic, among others,
the Board believes that flighterews should be exposed to simulated
microburst encounters during takeoff as well as approach phases of
flight. Cockpit Management.--The management of the final stages of the flight by
the flighterew was characterized by a lack of preparation and anticipation. The standard
cockpit duties were accomplished; however, there were no discussions by either flightcrew
member of the need for special consideration for the conditions present at the airport and
their potential effects on the instrument approach.</div>

respond to maximum power after it exited the rain and hail shaft. Even though his
restricted forward visibility may have precluded his awareness that over 8,000 feet of
runway remained, his knowledge that he was over the runway should have mitigated his
concern about possible ground contact after the landing gear were down during the
continued missed approach. Therefore, rather than reduce power and commit to a landing
before the landing gear were fully down, the Safety Board believes that the proper
decision would have been to continue the missed approach even after the landing gear
were lowered and even if a &quot;touch and go&quot; on the runway proved necessary to prevent
further loss of airspeed.

2.4 Operational Factors

The Safety Board believes that the major safety lesson from this accident
involves the flighterew&#x27;s decisions made at the beginning of the approach which led to
entering the microburst with its wind shear rather than in an evaluation of the crew&#x27;s
performance after the wind shear encounter or the ability of the airplane to penetrate the
microburst successfully. The key issues in the accident sequence thus were the
operational factors, which, combined with meteorological and airplane performance
factors, influenced the captain&#x27;s decision to initiate and continue the instrument approach
to runway 21R. To address these issues, the Safety Board analyzed the policies and
guidelines of USAir which addressed adverse weather, the role of air traffic control, and
the actions of the flightcrew during the instrument approach. USAir Policy and Procedures.--The USAir DC9 Pilot&#x27;s Handbook guidelines for
thunderstorm and wind shear encounters are supported by topical material in the company
flighterew publications (Flight Crew View and Flight Crew Quarterly). The company
publications expand on handbook policy and procedures and provide substantial
information on weather phenomena. Additionally, the thunderstorm and wind shear
information parallel data are contained in FAA Advisory Circular AC 00-50A, &quot;Low Level
Wind Shear.&quot; The information and guidance provided USAir pilots in company manuals and
handbooks were accurate and emphasized that wind shear and gust fronts associated with

thunderstorms can precede the actual storm by as much as 15 miles. Additionally, the
Pilot&#x27;s Handbook provides specific guidance for configuration of the airplane if a wind
shear may be encountered and for flying the airplane at stickshaker speeds. USAir does not have a specific policy which governs the avoidance of
thunderstorms in the terminal area. The Pilot&#x27;s Handbook, under the weather radar
section, states’ that storm cells should be avoided by 5 miles when the outside air
temperature is above freezing. However, the 5-mile guideline is not absolute. The
Director, Flight Training and Standards stated that the captain&#x27;s judgment in a landing
situation takes precedence over the 5-mile guideline in the handbook. Additionally, while
the handbook warned of thunderstorm-related hazards within 15 miles of the actual storm,
the information was regarded as advisory in nature and not a definite or suggested limit.</div>

microburst was over runway 4R at 2353:00. Thus, if flight 1420’s takeoff, en route flight,
or approach to landing had been delayed by less than 2 minutes, the flight could have
encountered the microburst on final approach. Microbursts can result in vertical and
horizontal windshear that can be extremely hazardous to aircraft, especially at low
altitudes, as demonstrated by the 1994 USAir flight 1016 accident in Charlotte, North
Carolina, and the 1985 Delta Air Lines flight 191 accident in Dallas, Texas (see
section 1.18.5). As a result, the Safety Board is concerned that the flight crew was
operating in an environment that was conducive to microburst conditions.192
Section 2.2.3.1.1 presents an industry-wide recommendation to develop operational
strategies and guidance to promote better flight crew decision-making regarding the
penetration of severe convective activity. 
2.2.2 The Landing 
Flight 1420 touched down on runway 4R at 2350:20 at a speed of 160 knots. The
airplane touched down about 2,000 feet down the 7,200-foot runway, slightly to the right
of the centerline and sliding to the right. According to calculations based on FDR data,
the airplane was subjected to a 5-knot tailwind component upon touchdown and a 20- to
25-knot left-to-right crosswind component during the landing. The NWS’ Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS) weather data indicated
that surface winds from 290° at 16 knots gusting to 22 knots were present about the time
that flight 1420 touched down, but this information was not available to the flight crew or
the controller because the system’s 2-minute wind data are not directly reported to the
control tower. The controller’s final wind report to the flight crew (320º at 23 knots,
which was transmitted 27 seconds before touchdown) would not have indicated the
possibility of a tailwind component at touchdown. Although the 5-knot tailwind
component was within the 10-knot limitation required by American’s flight manual and
advised by Boeing in its MD-80 Flight Crew Operating Manual (FCOM), the Safety
Board notes that the flight crew’s purpose in changing runways from 22L to 4R was to
avoid a tailwind component. The 20- to 25-knot crosswind component, however,
exceeded the 10-knot limitation required by American’s flight manual for a runway with
an RVR of less than 1,800 feet. 
192 The Safety Board notes that, during flight 1420’s final approach segment, the microburst was 
located northwest of the airport and that the missed approach procedure would have taken the airplane
east of the airport.</div>

configuration before reaching 1,000 feet afl and their failure to maintain a normal rate of

Safety Board concludes that, because of the flight crew’s failure to adequately prepare for
the approach and the rapidly deteriorating weather conditions, the likelihood of safely
completing the approach was decreasing, and the need to take a different course of action
190 Even though American’s flight manual indicated that windshear alerts were advisory, its DC-9 
Operating Manual instructed pilots to avoid areas of known severe windshear and search for clues
to indicate the presence of severe windshear. The operating manual indicated that such clues included
thunderstorm and convective clouds, rain showers, and strong or gusty surface winds. All of these
conditions were present at some point and to some degree during flight 1420’s approach to the airport.
191 The Safety Board notes that several events were competing for the first officer’s attention 
at the time that he was performing the Before Landing checklist, as detailed in section 2.2.1.3.
The Board further notes that, even though the first officer did not verbalize that the Before Landing
checklist had been completed, as required, the CVR indicated that he did verbalize (early in the
approach) that the Descent checklist had been completed. Analysis

was progressively increasing; as a result, the flight crew should have abandoned the
approach. Factors that contributed to the flight crew’s performance during the accident
flight are discussed in section 2.2.3. 
Finally, it is important to note that a microburst, with a peak wind gust of 76 knots
and rainfall rates of 9 inches per hour, impacted the airport shortly after the flight 1420
accident and thus was not a factor. NWS radar data, however, detected that the
microburst was over runway 4R at 2353:00. Thus, if flight 1420’s takeoff, en route flight,
or approach to landing had been delayed by less than 2 minutes, the flight could have

Part 7, “Safety of Flight,” includes only general information on the LLWAS. The

events. (A future software change to LLWAS will allow all system models to
differentiate between microburst and windshear alerts, but the only LLWAS systems that
currently make this differentiation are those that are integrated with TDWR systems.

Aircraft Accident Report
Airports with such LLWAS systems include Dallas/Fort Worth, Chicago O’Hare, Denver
International Airport, and Atlanta Hartsfield.) 
In addition, at the public hearing on this accident, the expert on LLWAS from the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Lincoln Laboratory indicated his concern that
pilots may be disregarding LLWAS alerts and continuing to operate into the terminal area
because they perceive that the alerts are false and that no windshear threat exists. This
situation may be occurring because pilots may not realize that the LLWAS sensors in use
today are not the same as those used in the late 1970s through the late 1980s, which
alerted when normal gusting winds were present. The latest LLWAS sensors include
technologies to reduce such false alerts, yet this information also does not appear in the
AIM. The Safety Board concludes that, if detailed information on the LLWAS were
contained in the FAA’s AIM, pilots could have a better understanding of the system. Therefore, the Safety Board believes that the FAA should provide additional information
on the LLWAS in the AIM, including that an LLWAS alert is a valid indicator of
windshear or a microburst.

Emergency Response
The local controller reported that he called the Aircraft Rescue and Fire Fighting
(ARFF) units on the crash phone about 2352 after several attempts to contact the flight
crew after the airplane landed. The controller indicated the possibility of an accident at
the end of runway 4R but did not specify which end of the runway. The ARFF units
proceeded to the approach end of runway 4R, but the airplane was off the departure end
of the runway. As a result, the ARFF units had to travel back to the taxiway at which they
entered the runway and then proceed to the other end of the runway. The ARFF units
located the airplane about 0003, 11 minutes after the initial call from the local controller.</div>

program reveale:! that the curriculum discussed the necessity of avoiding windshear
and emphasized that crewmembers should be able to recognize cues that either
indicate the possibility of a windshear or an actual encounter. The program at
USAir wa: comparable to industry standards contained in the Windshear Training
Aid, and the crew of flight 1016 had received the training. The USAir windshear training program provides crewmembers with a
table of microburst windshear probabilities based on different cues. These cues
include: (1) precipitation that is depicted as red on airborne weather radar has a
high probability of microburst activity; (2) an LLWAS alert of less than 20 knots has

197

a medium probability; and (3) an airspeed gain of greater than 15 knots has a high
probability of microburst activity. These guidelines apply to operations in the
airport vicinity, within 5 miles of the point of takeoff or landing along the intended
flightpath and below 1,000 feet agl. The cues should be considered cumulative and
if more than one is observed, the probability weighing should be increased. The Safety Board believes that the crew of flight 1016 was exposed to
at feast three windshear probability cues, two of which were rated as high. They
were the combination of convective weather conditions that existed at the airport;
the flightcrew’s visual observations and decision to make the missed approach to the
right; and the subsequent intracockpit discussions about the location of the rain. Finally, the flightpath that would have resulted from following the prescribed ILS
approach procedure offered a strong likelihood of an encounter with microburst
windshear activity. The observation of the microburst cues was further validated by the
CVR recording when the captain commented about 4 minutes before the accident
that the rain activity “looks like it&#x27;s sitting right on the (uninteltigible],&quot; to which the
first officer replied “yep, [the edge of the rain is}} laying right there this side of the
airport, isn&#x27;t it.” This information, combined with the previous knowledge gained
from the airbome weather radar about the weather cell, should have been a clear
indication that a microburst was very possible. Based on the guidance and training provided by USAir to this crew, the
Satety Board believes that there were sufficient microburst windshear cues
presented to the flightcrew that warranted abandoning the approach earlier. However. perb..ps because of incomplete or misleading weather information from
other sources (the “smooth ride&quot; report from another flight and visual contact with
the runway), the flightcrew&#x27;s perception of the weather was interpreted as
nonthreatening. Thus, they continued the approach beyond the fina’ -:proach fix. Nonetheless, based upon their simulator training, the Safety Board believes that
once the pilots «bserved the increased airspeed upon entry into the rain, they should
have recognized that a windshear condition existed, and they should have executed
a windshear escape maneuver.</div>

thunderstorm and rainshower activity. The Terminal Doppler Weather Radar (TDWR) had not been
installed at Charlotte/Douglas International Airport as scheduled. The accuracy of the TDWR would have provided the controllers
with definitive infor iation about the severity of the weather, and
the timely issuance of that information would have been
beneficial to the crew of flight 1016. The Phase II low level windshear alert system (LLWAS) at
Charlotte performed normally during the microburst event of
July 2, 1994, and was not adversely affected by the location of
the northwest wind sensor.

119

Inadequate controller procedures and a_ breakdown in
communications in the Charlotte air traffic control tower
prevented the crew of flight 1016 from receiving additional
Critical information about adverse weather conditions over the
airport and along the approach path to the ninway. The flightcrew&#x27;s decision to continue the approach into an area
of adverse weather may have been influenced by weather
information from the crews of preceding flights that had flown
the flightpath to runway 18R previously. The thunderstorm over the airport produced a microburst that
flight 1016 penetrated while on its approach to runway 18R. The horizontal windshear calculated for the microburst was as
much as 86 knots; however, flight 1016 encountered a windshear
computed to be 61 knots over a period of 15 seconds. An inadequate computer software design in the airplane&#x27;s
on-board windshear detection system prevented the flightcrew
from receiving a more timely windshear alert. Unaware that they had penetrated the first part of the microburst,
the captain commanded the first officer to execute a standard
missed approach instead of a windshear escape procedure. The first officer initially rotated the airplane to the proper 15°
10Se-up attitude during the missed approach. However, the
thrust was set below the standard go-around EPR limit of 1.93,
and the pitch attitude was reduced to 5° nose down before the
flightcrew recognized the dangerous situation. According to performance simulations, the airplane could have
overcome the windshear encounter if the pitch attitude of 15°
nose up had been maintained, the thrust had been set to 1.93,
and the landing gear had been retracted on schedule.

determined to be about 75 knots (at approximately 300 feet the winds were
86 knots), with the strongest downward vertical winds below 300 feet ag! calculated
to be 10 to 20 fps. The outflow winds most likely exhibited asymmetry with
stronger winds on the west side of the microburst. Witnesses to the accident reported localized heavy rain and gusty
winds near the approach end of runway 18R. Several witnesses reported that the
winds were gusty with wind speeds of 20 to 35 knots, while one witness under the
flightpath of flight 1016 reported wind speeds of up to 50 to 60 miles per hour. The
wind directions reported suggest the center of an area of divergence located cast of
runway i8R. Pilots, both on the ground and in the air, reported that the thunderstorm
appeared as a small echo approximately 3 miles in diameter and indicated &quot;mostly
red&quot; on the radar. About 1832, the first officer of USAir Flight 806 noticed tw
strikes of cloud-to-ground lightning about 15 seconus apart to the east-southeast of
the field. The crew of flight 806 also stated that as they taxied on taxiway E-12,
they saw a wall of water approaching from the south. They said that the “visibility
through the precipitation was nonexistent.&quot;

2.2.3 Wind Field Anaiysis

An area of VIP level 6 echo returns was centered near the approach
end of runway 18R about the time of the accident. These storm areas were capable
of producing microburst activity and peak rainfall rates of 10 inches per hour or
higher.

All available data were used to compute the horizontal winds
encountered by flight 1016 during the last moments of flight. The airplane
encountered a windshear 7 to 8 seconds after the missed approach was initiated. Computations indicate that during the initial climb, after the missed approach was
initiated and during the final descent (to within 2 to 3 seconds of ground impact), the
wind along the flightpath changed significantly. The computations revealed that the
wind shifted from a headwind of about 35 knots to a tailwind of about 26 knots in
15 seconds. The vertical velocity component of the wind field was also examined
and it was determined that the vertical wind velocity increased from about 10 fps
down to about 25 fps down, and increased further to 30 fps down as the airplane
attained its maximum altitude and transitioned into a descent. It was during the
latter portions of the descent, approximately 2 to 3 seconds before ground impact,
that the vertical velocity component of the wind field decreased to about 5 to 10 fps
down.</div>

The severity of the effects produced by an encounter with a
decreasing headwind will depend on the magnitude of the change in wind
speed and the abruptness with which the change occurs. Obviously, the
higher the speed change and the shorter the time interval involved, the
greater the effect on the airplane&#x27;s flightpath. ’

. Other significant factors include the airplane&#x27;s entry airspeed,
its configuration, and its flight characteristics under such conditions. For example, a jet transport which encounters the wind change at an indicated airspeed of 155 kn will experience less loss of lift and will develop
a lower initial descent rate than the same airplane which encounters the
condition at 140 kn. Also, a smaller aircraft, with a lower wing loading,
and operating with a higher relative airspeed margin between approach
and stall speeds, will likely be less affected than the large transport. Therefore, the pilot of a jet transport who flies at a higher-than-normal
approach speed and the pilot of a small airplane who flies at a normal
approach speed may be able to stop the rate of descent imposed on their
aircraft quicker, with lower control forces, and with less thrust addition
than the pilot of a jet transport who flies at normal approach speed. As illustrated above, passage through either a downdraft or
a decreasing headwind can singularly be hazardous; however, when combined, the two conditions produce an even more critical situation. A
mature thunderstorm cell contains both. As the airplane approaches
the storm, it encounters the influence of the horizontal outflow in the
opposite direction of flight as an increasing headwind; as the flight
continues, it passes below the storm and through the peak downdraft. Almost immediately, the change in direction of the horizontal outflow
will affect the aircraft as an abrupt decrease or loss of headwind. The
sequence of the wind change can be particularly dangerous since the
pilot might reduce power when he senses the positive performance
effect caused by the initially increasing headwind. Therefore, the airplane may already be power deficient when it encounters the downdraft
and loss of headwind; thus, their negative effect on the airplane&#x27;s
performance is compounded. The Safety Board concludes from the evidence that Eastern
66 and at least four of the flights which preceded it encountered abrupt
changes in the vertical and horizontal winds on the approach path to
runway 22L. When Eastern 66 was tracking the glideslope near the OM, the
airplane was affected by a slight headwind and little or no vertical winds. While the airplane descended and approached the strongest cells of the
thunderstorm, it was influenced by the vertical winds and the horizontal
outflow. The increase in headwind of about 15 kn and possibly an updraft produced a reduction in the rate of descent and the airplane moved
slightly above the glidepath as it descended between 600 feet and 500 feet.</div>

slightly above the glidepath as it descended between 600 feet and 500 feet. When the flight descended through 500 feet, about 8,000 feet from the
runway threshold, the airplane was passing into the most severe part of
.the storm. The vertical draft changed to a downdraft of about 16 fps
and the headwind diminished about 5 kn. As the airplane descended
through 400 feet, the downdraft velocity increased to about 21 fps and
the airplane began to descend rapidly below the glideslope. Almost
simultaneously, the change in the direction of the horizontal outflow
produced a 15-kn decrease in the airplane&#x27;s headwind component, which
caused the airplane to lose more lift and to pitch nose down. Consequently, the descent rate increased. The wind conditions encountered by Flying Tiger 161, Eastern
902, Finnair 105, and N240V were similar but possibly less severe
than those encountered by Eastern 66. All of these flights managed to
negotiate the conditions without mishap, but not without difficulty. The
captain of Flying Tiger 161 stated that after he recognized the shear he
needed near maximum thrust to keep his aircraft from losing altitude. At that point, he was not sure of his aircraft&#x27;s missed-approach capability
and he had to continue to a landing. The pilot of Eastern 902 had no forward visibility when he penetrated the area of the most severe wind changes. Therefore, he was
flying his aircraft solely by reference to flight instruments. It is
obvious from the DFDR traces that he immediately recognized the downward acceleration of his aircraft and responded with the addition of
thrust and noseup pitch changes. Nevertheless, the aircraft descended
about 120 feet below the glideslope and within about 70 feet of the elevation
of the approach lights. The pilot of Finnair 105 anticipated the adverse wind conditions.
and added 20 to 25 Im to his normal approach reference airspeed. Although he too experienced an increase in the rate of descent as a result
of the downdraft and horizontal wind changes, the total effect and control
corrections required to decrease the rate of descent were probably
lessened by the higher airspeed. The pilot apparently detected the effect
of the wind and responded rapidly to maintain flightpath control. Likewise, the pilot of N240V, a Beechcraft Baron, was able to
limit the altitude loss caused by the wind conditions with less difficulty
because of the different flight characteristics of his smaller aircraft
and because he was flying it at a higher-than-normal approach speed. The flightcrew of Eastern 66 was made aware of the adverse
wind conditions by Eastern 902&#x27;s report on wind shear, and they, too,
added 10 to 15 kn to their normal approach reference speed.</div>

Air flow is disturbed significantly within a mature thunderstorm cell and in the air mass surrounding the cell. These disturbances
are dominated generally by vertical drafts, both up and down, which are
created when the relatively cold and more dense air formed at higher _
altitudes displaces the warmer and less dense air near the surface. The
downdrafts, which are frequently accompanied by heavy rain, can reach
vertical speeds exceeding 30 fps. The interaction between the descending
air and the earth&#x27;s surface causes the flow to change from the vertical
w+. crcauus to the horizontal direction and creates a horizontal outflow of

air in all directions beneath the cell and near the surface. The speeds
of the vertical drafts and horizontal outflows depend on the severity of
the storm. An aircraft passing through, below, or near a thunderstoi...
cell at low altitude may encounter these rapidly changing vertical and
horizontal winds. 5

To analyze the effects of these rapidly changing winds on the
flightpath of an airplane,’ forces which act on the airplane must be
considered. These forces are lift, drag, weight, and thrust. Ina
dynamic situation, changes in the lift and drag are most significant
because they depend at any instant on the airplane&#x27;s relative wind
vector; that is, the direction and speed of the impinging air stream
relative to the airplane&#x27;s control axes. The airplane&#x27;s weight can be
considered a constant since it varies only as fuel is consumed. Thrust
is related primarily to throttle position and only to a small extent to
the properties of the engine inlet air. The analysis is simplfied by resolving the components of
these forces along the aircraft&#x27;s vertical and longitudinal axes. As
long as the components of the forces are balanced, the airplane will
remain in unaccelerated flight. However, if the forces are unbalanced,
by the pilot&#x27;s manipulation of the throttles or flight controls or by a
change in the environment surrounding the airplane, the airplane will
accelerate or decelerate until a new flightpath is established and the
forces are again balanced. When the airplane flies into a vertical wind, the transient
change in the direction of the total wind vector, relative to the airplane&#x27;s entry path, causes a change in both lift and drag. If the
vertical wind&#x27;s direction is downward, the lift and drag will decrease
and the airplane will accelerate downward. The basic stability of the
airplane will cause it to pitch nose up initially; however, the ultimate
effect on the airplane&#x27;s flightpath will be an increase in the descent
rate relative to the ground. If the flight controls remain fixed, the
aircraft will restabilize and descend with the descending air mass. Thus, the change in the airplane&#x27;s rate of descent relative to the
ground will equal the vertical speed of the wind and, if longitudinal-

wind does not change, the airspeed will remain approximately constant. The pilot can compensate for this condition by increasing the airplane&#x27;s
pitch attitude and by adding thrust to establish a climb relative to the
descending air mass. He will thereby maintain the desired flightpath.</div>

the repori:ed weather conditions, the pilots probably saw the airport and
che first officer began the circling maneuver for alignment with runway
19 near the expected position--about 1.5 mi northeast of the threshold
for runway 23 and at an altitude near MDA. With the airport and the lighted runway in sight at the beginning
of the maneuver, the first of*icer&#x27;s attention primarily would have been
directed toward the maintenance of those visual references. Additionally,
since there was no company requirement that the nonflying pilot call out
airspeeds, altitudes, or rates of descent for visual flight below MDA,
bo’.n pilots probably were concentrating on those visual references. When the aircraft was turned toward the west and the descent
below MDA was begun, it is. probable that all four factors--low visibility,
wind shear combined with the aircraft&#x27;s forward c.g. condition, visual

illusions, and type of approach--combined to produce a complex, unstabilized,

and illusory approach proftle. The aircraft&#x27;s entry into a diminishing
headwind shear condition would have caused the aircraft&#x27;s nose to pitch
down and would have caused the descent flightpath angle and rate of
descent to increase. As these effects materialized, it is likely that
nonhomogeneous fog ccnditions were encountered, Under these conditions,
the pilcts&#x27; reactions to the illusion created by the reduced visual
range cculd nave caused adcitional increases in the descent flightpath

probably disguised pitch control forces and other forces that might have .

provided the pilot with kinesthetic cues about the aircraft&#x27;s actual

induced increases in the aircrafc&#x27;s descent flightpath angle and rate of
descent which, when combined with the increased pitch control forces

Wind Shear Combined with the Aircraft&#x27;s Forward c.g. Condition-- Bi
An analysis of the weather conditions that existed in the Atlantic City Ry
area on the night of the accident shows that wind shear existed at 1 w Moa
altitudes and that the wind shear was associated with a warm front that :
moved rapidly northeastward through the area. The wind shear measurement Bf
made vy the FAA at NAFEC clearly defined two distinct layers of shear. A

Although these measurements were made about 30 mi northeast of
Cape May County Airport and were made about 37 min before ~he accident, .
the warm front sloped toward the northeast and passed across the Cape 4
May area at the surface about 2340. Therefore, the Safety Board concludes Pw
that similar wind shear conditions existed in the Cape May area when the _

Aircraft performance calculations based on the conditions

: hup: ttesized show that, in moderate wind shear of 5 kns per 100 ft, the
’ aire.aft would have terded to pitch nosedown to maintain its trimmed
: airspeed, and its rate of descent and descent flightpath angle would

have increased significantly if the rfilot took no corrective action. The aircraft&#x27;s tendency to pitch nosedown would have been reinforced

by the increased longitudinal stability associated with its forward
c.g. condition. To prevent the descent flightpath angle from incrvasing Pt
without increasing the noseup pitch trim, it would have been nece3sary
for the pilot to apply and hold substantial amounts of back pressure on
the control column which, assuming a constant thrust condition, would
have caused the airspeed to decrease. Because of the aircraft&#x27;s at
forward c.g. location, the amount of back pressure needed to maintain \
a coastant descerr flignhtpath angle would have increased by 56 percent
over that required for a DHC--6 with a midrange c.g. location, which is
approximately the location calculated by the rlightcrew. Consequently,
unless the pilot was aware of the need f.ur substantially increased pitch
control forces, the associated hinesthetic cues could have led him to !
use less pull force than needed to mainta‘n a cons? ant descent flightpath ;
angie, and the aircraft would still have pitched nosedown in response to 7
the wind shear, but at a lesser angle than for the zero control force
situation. &#x27; a

Be ete ne meee ne. Visual {{llusions--Visual illusicns within nonhomogeneous
visual fields are well known hazards associated with a pilot&#x27;s reliance
on visual references to conduct an approach and tanding in conditions of
low visibility. 6/ A pilot will be influenced by these illusions when
his visual range is shortened by a sudden reduction in visibility, such
as that encountered when the aircraft enters nonhomogeneous fog. The
shortened visual range creates the illusion that the aircraft is too
high and 13 going higher. Unless this illusion is recognized and conscilously resisted, the pilot wiil decrease the aircraft&#x27;s pitch attitude
(and increase the descent flightpath angle) in an attemrt to make the
visual range increase and appear normal again.</div>

Board to examine the last portion of the approach. These sudies showed chat if the 15
knots tailwind ceased for 10 secands when the
aircraft passed through about 400 feet it would
result in a flight recorder trace similar to the one

obtained from the accident. Additionally, the
reduction in power to an Ny compressor speed
of 60 percent is a natural result of observing an
airspeed 10 knots higher than desired,

Witnesses varied in their evaluation of the
init&#x27;al impace attitude of the aircraft. One
witness stated that the aircraft struck the waver
in a noscup attivude, whercas other witnesses
described the aircre“e striking the water ia a
nosedown attitude, This variance in witness
obseivetions can be reconciled by the difference
in visual angles, distance from the impact area,
and the reduced visibility caused by the rain
shower in the area of the accident. The crew adhered closely to hzading and altitude instructions until level off upon reaching
Flying Tiger minimums (300 feet), Thereafter,
however, the aircraft descended through the
Decision Heignt and contacted che water. Accordingly, the investigation was directed toward
determining what factors may have led to this
unwarranted descent. The Safety Board has considered and ruled
out the following as possible mechanisms of
causation:

(1) In-flight failure, malfunction, or abnor-

mality that would have caused or contributed to an unwarranted rate of descent.

(2) An unauthorized person in the cockpit.

(3) Pilot fatigue.

United States was reviewed in an effort to associate the changes with those that existed at Naha

(1) Falling pressure as the storin approaches;

(2}} An abrupe rise in pressure associated
with rain showers as the storm moves
overhead; and,

(2) A gradual return to nurmal pressure as
the storm moves on and the rain ceases. Thus, atmospheric pressure within an area of
heavy precipitation as at Okinawa would be
slightly higher than the pressure in the surrounding environment. Flying towards a zone of higher pressure, at a
particular flight level, and with a constant altimeter setting, causes the altimeter to read too
low. The indicated altitude is lower than the
actual altitude. Accordingly, as in the case of
Flight 45, the error, if any, would have been on
the safe side. In view of the above, the Board finds no
evidence to indicate that atmospheric pressure
fluctuations were involved in the causal area of
this accident. :

A pressure difference of approximately 33
inches of mercury would be required besween
the ambient air pressure and the static system
pressure to obtain a 300-foot altimeter error. The airspeed indicator would read coacomitantly about 23 knots in error (high in this case).

During the latter part of 1968 and the early
part of 1969, arash of serious aircraft accidents
occurred during the instrument approach phase
of flight. As a results of those accidents, the
National Transportation Safety Board. by letter
dated January 17, 1969, made a number of

recommendations to the Administrator of the
Federal Aviation Administration, Among others,
it recommended that the Administrator: emphasize the importance of altwude awareness
during instrument approaches through strict attention to instrument indications, ceew coordination, and altitude callout procedures.</div>

along uneven ground also likely contributed to the delay. The NTSB concludes that the captain’s 
initiation of a rejected takeoff was delayed by about 2 to 4 seconds because he was occupied with 
the nosewheel steering tiller and right control wheel input, both of which were ineffective and 
inappropriate for steering the airplane. At the time of the accident, mountain wave and downsloping winds were creating

strength and variable nature of the wind conditions factored into this accident, the NTSB 
evaluated the ability of meteorological instruments and ATC system components to accurately 
discern and disseminate pertinent wind condition information to pilots. The wind’s strength and 
direction are key factors in runway selection by ATC and pilots; therefore, the NTSB evaluated 
how the known conditions influenced the selection of runway 34R for departures. 
2.3.1 
Weather Information 
2.3.1.1 
Mountain Wave Activity and Associated Local Winds 
According to FAA AC 00-57, mountain wave activity can result in strong winds and wind 
gusts across an airport’s surface, resulting in directional control challenges for pilots taking off 
and landing. At the time of this accident, mountain wave and downsloping wind conditions 
existed in the Denver area, and the strong localized winds associated with these conditions 
resulted in pulses of strong wind gusts at the surface that posed a threat to DEN operations. The 
NTSB has previously noted the potential hazard that mountain wave conditions present to 
airplane operations. As a result of its investigation of the March 3, 1991, accident involving 
United Airlines flight 585 in Colorado Springs, Colorado, the NTSB issued two safety 
recommendations asking the FAA to conduct meteorological research and analyze these potential 
hazards for airplane operations in the Colorado Springs area and other areas with airports located 
in or near mountainous terrain. As a result of these recommendations, the FAA, with NOAA and 
NCAR, conducted research and collected data on hazardous mountain winds and published an 
AC addressing these winds and their effects on flight operations near mountainous regions. In 
addition, the FAA initiated programs to study the potential for terrain-induced turbulence in other 
locations, including Juneau, Alaska.</div>

data obtained from Continental during this investigation revealed that only 4 out of 250,327 
Boeing 737-500 takeoffs reviewed occurred in crosswind components of 30 knots or greater during 
the 8 years preceding the accident (and 58 additional events occurred involving other airplanes in 
Continental’s fleet during the same period). 
The NTSB notes that the FAA is currently participating in collaborative, proactive, and 
voluntary safety programs with several airlines involving the collection of operational flight data by 
onboard flight data recording devices and the subsequent analysis of such data for the 
identification of trends and potential safety vulnerabilities. Because, in many cases, the 
operational flight data can be linked to related airport, runway, and/or weather information, the 
data generated through these safety programs could prove valuable for learning more about the 
context in which high crosswind component takeoffs are occurring and the extent to which they 
are a safety hazard. These encounters could be identified by looking for large rudder corrections 
during the takeoff roll or by using air data to estimate the magnitude of the crosswind component 
shortly after takeoff.99
2.5 
Other Issues 
 Once identified, high crosswind component takeoffs could be related to 
archival data from other sources. For example, several airlines (including Continental) are able to 
match routine weather observations with operational flight data for individual flights. By 
analyzing the location, timing, and reported weather conditions in which these events are 
occurring, the FAA should be able to identify additional training or operational strategies for 
reducing the frequency of such events, thus reducing the risk of crosswind-related runway 
excursions. The NTSB concludes that operational flight data from U.S. airlines regarding high 
crosswind component encounters could help the FAA develop additional strategies for reducing 
the risk of crosswind-related runway excursions. Therefore, the NTSB recommends that the FAA 
work with U.S. airline operators to review and analyze operational flight data to identify factors 
that contribute to encounters with excessive winds and use this information to develop and 
implement additional strategies for reducing the likelihood of wind-related runway excursions. 
2.5.1 Cockpit Seats 
Both pilot seats in the accident airplane failed during the accident sequence. Postaccident 
examination of the seats revealed that both seats’ crotch-restraining-strap attachment points were 
fractured in an upward direction and that both seat height adjustment mechanisms had failed in a 
downward direction, “bottoming out” during the impact sequence. These failures indicate that 
the pilots’ seats experienced both upward and downward crash forces in excess of their structural 
capabilities. Both pilots complained of back injuries after the accident, and medical records 
indicated that the captain sustained multiple lumbar and thoracic spinal fractures.</div>

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] Airplane control dynamics may 
also be affected by the magnitude or frequency of pilot control inputs. Although some bracketing 
of the target rudder position is necessary in both steady and gusty crosswind conditions, 
bracketing with control inputs that oscillate too much or too slowly when taking off in very 
strong and gusty wind conditions may increase the risk of pilot confusion about the relationship 
between control inputs and airplane response. Therefore, wind characteristics and pilot technique 
may interact to affect the difficulty of a crosswind takeoff. 
98
 
97 Because the wind estimate results of the NTSB’s airplane performance study (which indicated gusty 
crosswinds of 45 knots) were not available at the time, the attempted takeoffs performed in the operational simulator 
study did not replicate stronger gusty winds. 
98 Since the NTSB recommended that realistic windshear and microburst wind models be incorporated in flight 
simulators in the early 1980s, the industry has incorporated such models into pilot training programs. Pilots given the opportunity to practice takeoffs in realistic 
strong and gusty crosswind conditions would have a chance to identify effective and ineffective

NTSB

53 
techniques for steering the airplane in such conditions, thus increasing the likelihood of effective 
performance. Additionally, such training could help pilots develop a more realistic appreciation 
of their own abilities and of the potential difficulty associated with crosswind takeoffs in high 
and gusty winds and about whether to initiate a takeoff in such conditions. Although pilots should avoid taking off in very strong and gusty crosswinds, real-time 
pertinent wind information may not always be available; providing pilots with training in how to 
deal with very strong and gusty crosswinds that they might inadvertently encounter would 
increase their ability to react appropriately to these situations. If the accident captain, for 
example, had been exposed to realistic takeoff scenarios involving very strong and gusty 
crosswinds in a flight simulator during pilot training, he would have been better equipped to 
compensate for the conditions he unexpectedly encountered during the attempted takeoff that 
resulted in the accident. If airline pilots were exposed to more realistic gusty surface crosswinds 
during flight simulator training, they would be able to develop related skills and realistic 
expectations in a controlled training environment, thus improving their ability to handle extreme 
surface wind conditions that are inadvertently encountered during real-world operations. Airplane performance analyses conducted during this investigation provided a 
high-resolution sample of second-by-second changes in wind speed and direction that occurred 
during the attempted takeoff. These data represent a complex crosswind condition, the strong and 
gusty nature of which, according to Continental’s operational flight data, is rarely encountered 
during normal operations and which was evidently very challenging for the accident captain, a 
highly experienced and skilled pilot. The NTSB concludes that, because Continental’s simulator 
training did not replicate the ground-level disturbances and gusting crosswinds that often occur 
at or near the runway surface, and it is unlikely that the accident captain had previously 
encountered gusting surface crosswinds like those he encountered the night of the accident, the 
captain was not adequately prepared to respond to the changes in heading encountered during 
this takeoff.</div>

wind conditions with a predominsntly increasing headwind end/or an
updraft about 50 seconds before tmpact. The influence of this wind
condition persisted for about 25 seconds. The Safety board believes
that the windshear was caused by the outflowing winds from the rainstorm
over the airport as they were arfected by the upsloping terrain arcund
Logotala Hill. The windshear was evident by a sharp increase in airspeed
ana 2 shallowing of the descent path. Consequently, the aircraft went
above the glide slope. The airspeed at this time was still about 160
kn. The sound spectogram showed that, at this time, the thrust was
reduced .o apparently correct the high end fast condition. As the aircraft passed Logota.a Hil], it apparently came out
of the increasing headwind or updraft condition and the positive performance effect wesc lost. In fact, a wind which produced a small negative
performance effect was probably encountered. The thrust was well below
that normally needed for a stabilized approach, and, about 16 seconds
before impact, the aircraft started a rapid descent of about 1,500 fpm. RE ae RTT Tr cee ne ee ee ee oe ee

Thus, the Board concludes tat the cantain recognized the
initial effect of the windshezar cond/tion and acted te correct the
aircraft&#x27;s flight protile by reducing thrust, but he did not recognize
the second effect as the windshear vondition changed. Consequently,
the aircraft, with low thrust, resvonded to the changing wind by devel--
oping a high descent rate. The cuptain had at least 12 seconds in which
he could have taken action to arrest the descent in time to prevent the
accident. During that time, the total thrust avatlabie exceeded that
required to maintain constant airspeed in level flight. That the
necessary pitch attitude ana thrust changes were not applied can only
indicate that the flightczew was not aware of the high descent rate and
che impending crash. Evidence indicated that, when the sink rate increased, the

captain may have been looking outside the aircraft and, therefore, was
not flying by reference to the flight :lnstruments. At the time the sink
rate increased to about 1,500 fpm, the aircraft was over an area devoid
of lights (known es a &quot;blackhole”), a Leavy tropical rainstorm was over
the airport and roving toward the approach end of the ruuway, and the
first officer hud calied the runway in sight.</div>

1. There was no evidence of preimpact structural failure,
fire, or £light control or powerplant maltunction.

2. Flight 806 was conducting an ILS/DME approach to runway 5
at Pago Pago International Airport; the captain was
flying the eircraft; the third officer was performing
first officer duties and was qualified to do so. All compenents of the ILS and visual guidance lighting
systems were operating properly.

When Flight 806 was approximately 1.25 nmi from the
airport, the positive performance effect of the windshear
diminished and the airplane, because of the reduced
thrust, began descending at a rate of 1,500 fpn. The 1,500-fpm descent rate was not corrected for 15
seconds until just before i. pact, although power was
increased during the last 4 seconds,

The flightcrew had at least sone of the runwey lights in
sight during the last 2 minutes 50 seconds of the flight. The flightcrew probably did not recognize the development
of the increasing descent rate and the deviation below
glide slope because of their reliance on visual references;
although VAST was available and operating, the lights may
have been obscured by rain. A visual assessment of vertical guidance would heve been
difficult because of an absence of visual cues and the
&quot;blackhole&quot; approach phenomena. Although the first officer monitored and called out
airspeeds and minimum altitude during the final seconds
of the flight, there were no rate of descent callouts by
any of the nonflying crew although the descent rate
exceeded the 1,000 fpm recommended maximum for at least
15 seconds. The No. 2 nav receiver was tunet to the VO% frequency to
provide DME information end the first officer had not
switched to display the ILS information on hia instrunents;
consequently, the glide slope raw deta and flight director
steering commands were displayed only on the captain&#x27;s
instrument panel.

deteriorated, neither crewmember discussed a need to initiate a go-around, enter a
holding pattern, or divert to an alternate airport. The Safety Board also notes that any
delay in landing would have further extended the pilots’ duty day, but there is no
evidence to indicate that this factor affected the flight crew’s decision to continue the
approach. The flight crewmembers’ intention to expedite the landing despite the weather
diverted their attention away from other activities during the final minutes of the flight
and, as a result, affected the crew’s ability to properly assess the situation and make
effective decisions. Therefore, the Safety Board concludes that the flight crewmembers’
focus on expediting the landing because of the impending weather contributed to their
degraded performance.
2.2.3.1.1 Industry Standards and Practices
The Safety Board evaluated the flight crew’s decision to conduct an approach to
an airport environment surrounded by severe convective activity in relation to
contemporary industry standards and practices. Most airlines and flight training programs
instruct pilots to avoid thunderstorms during routine operations. However, data from
accidents and incidents demonstrate that pilots penetrate thunderstorms—in some cases
with catastrophic results, as shown by the USAir flight 1016 and the Delta flight 191
accidents. In fact, in its final report on the Delta flight 191 accident, the Safety Board
stated that “there is an apparent lack of appreciation on the part of some, and perhaps
many, flight crews of the need to avoid thunderstorms and to appraise the position and
severity of the storms pessimistically and cautiously.” Analysis

Aircraft Accident Report
A June 1999 report sponsored by NASA and conducted by research staff at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Lincoln Laboratory (see section 1.18.2) used
weather radar and ATC radar data sources to document flight crew behavior during
60 hours of observations in the Dallas/Fort Worth terminal area during convective
activity. This research documented that pilots routinely penetrated thunderstorms with
NWS precipitation intensity levels of 3 (strong), 4 (very strong), and 5 (extreme) rather
than deviated around them, especially when approaching an airport to land. Of the 1,952
encounters with thunderstorm cells recorded in these data, pilots penetrated the
thunderstorms 1,310 times (67 percent). However, the study did not include information
from the pilots regarding the reasons for the actions documented by the flight data. The
study concluded that pilots were more likely to penetrate a thunderstorm when they were
flying after dark, flying within 10 to 16 miles of the airport, following another aircraft, or
running behind schedule by more than 15 minutes. All but one of these factors (following
another aircraft) applied to the accident flight.</div>

flying after dark, flying within 10 to 16 miles of the airport, following another aircraft, or
running behind schedule by more than 15 minutes. All but one of these factors (following
another aircraft) applied to the accident flight. In its final report on the Delta flight 191 accident, the Safety Board stated its
concern that “the present training within the industry for windshear encounters on the final
approach seems to advocate the philosophy that the retrieval of the approach profile is the
desired end result and not escape from the environment.” The results of the NASA study,
which was completed 13 years after the Delta flight 191 accident report was issued,
demonstrate that this industry philosophy can also apply to the penetration of severe
thunderstorms. Some air carriers, including American, provide their flight crews with only
general, advisory information on severe weather avoidance. As a result, the individual
flight crews are responsible for making decisions on whether an approach near
convective activity should continue, and such decisions are typically based on the pilots’
subjective assessment of the severity of the situation and their experience. The Safety
Board is aware that some other air carriers provide their pilots with specific operational
guidance, including decision aids and flow charts in quick reference checklists, from
which flight crews can make “go” or “no go” decisions concerning operations near
hazardous weather. Such information includes a detailed list of specific cues and
operational criteria from which pilots can easily assess weather conditions and
objectively determine whether they can safely continue or need to take a different course
of action. As a result, the pilots do not have to rely on an open-ended decision-making
process regarding whether and at what point to deviate around weather. Further, these
explicit, formalized cue recognition and decision aids minimize the potential for
thunderstorm penetrations resulting from impaired judgment and decision-making
because of situational stress or fatigue. In addition, as demonstrated in this accident, airborne weather radar does not
always facilitate a flight crew’s assessment of a thunderstorm regarding the storm’s
location and movement relative to the airport and its severity, including the potential for
microburst conditions. The Safety Board is aware that recent technologies, such as
moving airport map displays integrated with airborne weather radar displays and real-time
wind readouts, are available in new-generation airplanes with “glass cockpits.”208 Also, Analysis
143
Aircraft Accident Report
NASA, the FAA, and avionics manufacturers are testing whether ground-based advanced
weather graphics, such as regional radar mosaics and single Doppler radar images, can be
up-linked to airplanes. These graphics can show enhanced detail of a thunderstorm
(including its intensity, movement, and tops) and other weather information; therefore,
they have the potential for providing flight crews with in-flight information to improve
their situational awareness and decision-making regarding hazardous weather. Because the NASA study showed no discernible differences among operators and
airplane types regarding the propensity to penetrate thunderstorms, the Safety Board
concludes that aircraft penetration of thunderstorms occurs industry-wide.</div>

Analysis
2.1
General
The captain and the first officer of American Airlines flight 1420 were properly
certificated and qualified under Federal and company requirements. No evidence
indicated any preexisting medical or behavioral conditions that might have adversely
affected the flight crew’s performance during the accident flight. The accident airplane was properly certified, equipped, and maintained in
accordance with Federal regulations and approved company procedures. No evidence
indicated preexisting engine, system, or structural failures. This analysis focuses primarily on the flight crew’s performance and the
airplane’s spoiler system. The flight crew’s performance on approach to the airport is
examined during three segments of the approach and in the context of the weather
information and cues that were available. The flight crew’s and the airplane’s
performance during the landing and overrun sequences are also examined. The analysis
also addresses the roles of situational stress and fatigue in the accident sequence;
meteorological support, including ATC services; emergency response efforts; airport
issues; and American and FAA oversight. 
2.2
Accident Scenario
2.2.1 The Approach 
The flight crew had multiple sources of information indicating that thunderstorms
might become a factor during the approach. The preflight weather package (discussed in
section 1.7.3) included two NWS weather advisories for severe thunderstorms and a
company SIGMEC [significant meteorological condition] for a widely scattered area of
thunderstorms along the planned route. Also, the dispatcher’s 2254 message via the
aircraft communication addressing and reporting system informed the crew of the lines of
thunderstorms to the left and right of the planned route and suggested that the crew
expedite the arrival to the airport “to beat the thunderstorms.” In addition, NWS
Convective SIGMET [significant meteorological information] 15C, received about 2304,
warned of a line of severe thunderstorms moving southeast through Arkansas with hail up
to 2 inches in diameter and the possibility of wind gusts to 70 knots. Finally, automatic
terminal information service (ATIS) information Romeo, which was current beginning
about 2326, indicated that a thunderstorm with frequent lightning was located west
through northwest of the airport and moving northeast. Analysis

assessing accurately the VIP level of the cell. The Safety Board concludes that the thunderstorm, which was at the airport at
1656, was a VIP level 4 storm which was traveling along the northeast portion of the
airport at 30 knots. The VIP level was confirmed by weather radar observations at 1730. The heavy rain, 3/4-inch hail, and wind gusts to 42 knots further confirm the intensity of
the thunderstorm. 13/ The center of the cell passed over the approach end of runway 21L,
which placed the rain and hail shaft in the path of Flight 183. Based on the length of time
Flight 183 was in the heavy rain and hail (11 seconds on the CVR at an average
groundspeed of 127 knots), the diameter of the shaft was about 0.3 nautical mile at 100 to
200 feet above the ground. Wind Direction and Speeds.--The wind information at Detroit was based upon
recorded surface observations, the NWS gust recorder, and the ATC tapes of the local
controller reporting wind readings from the LLWAS. (The LLWAS wind data were not
recorded.) The wind data were insufficient for investigators to develop the complete wind
field associated with the thunderstorm which passed over the airport about 1656 or to
determine the horizontal wind components which affected Flight 183. The direction of the centerfield winds between 1650:54 and 1655:23 was
virtually steady at 320 degrees. The speed increased from 11 knots to 28 knots with gusts.
to 42 knots. The north boundary LLWAS anemometer was in alarm throughout the period,
which further indicates that the path of the cell was along the northern portion of the
airport. The north boundary winds consistently were from the west-southwest. The east
boundary anemometer, while only going into alarm twice, consistently indicated winds
from the northwest before the accident. Because there were no reports from the west
anemometer, the wind pattern cannot be documented definitely from ground-based
sensors. It would appear, however, that the wind pattern generally represented an
increasing headwind as Flight 183 approached the airport. Since the storm was a classical
thunderstorm, the wind flow undoubtedly spread radially from the center. An increasing
headwind followed by an increasing tailwind as developed in the airplane performance
study confirmed that the airplane encountered the outflow from a storm when it entered .
and exited the rain and hail shaft.

13/ The NWS defines a severe thunderstorm as one with wind 50 knots or greater with
3/4-ineh hail.

2.3 Airplane Aerodynamic Performance

The airspeed and altitude data recorded on the airplane&#x27;s UFDR show
conclusively that the airplane encountered divergent winds characteristic of microbursts
as it passed through the heavy rain and hail during the approach... As the airplane
descended through 1,200 feet m.s.1., about 560 feet above the ground, the descent rate
and airspeed were stabilized.

radar overlay from the NWS weather radar at Detroit confirmed VIP level 3 cells about
40 miles west moving from 260 degrees at 30 knots. Pilots, including the flightcrew of Flight 183, who arrived in the Detroit area
about the time of the accident observed weather cells on their cockpit weather
radarsecopes. The weather echos were to the west and southwest, 0 to 10 miles from the
airport. The flighterew of Flight 183 observed a contouring cell about 5 to 8 miles
west-southwest of Detroit Metropolitan Airport when Flight 183 was 10 to 15 miles from
the airport. The captain of Learjet N103CF observed a weather radar cell moving across
the northern portion of the airport at the time of the accident. The weather radar
indicated to the Learjet captain that the storm was of significant intensity because it
appeared red on the radarscope and because he observed a sharp rain gradient. In addition to ground and airborne radar indications of thunderstorm activity,
pilots, including the flighterew of Flight 183, visually observed thunderstorms west of
Detroit as they came within 100 miles of the airport. The weather observer at the
Detroit NWS station visually observed a thunderstorm about 3 miles west of the airport at
1635, which was the basis of the 1636 special observation. Based on this evidence, the Safety Board concludes that the thunderstorm
which affected Flight 183 at 1656 was part of an area of scattered cells which were
observed as early as 1615, and which were noted by pilots and ground observers visually,

and on radar, within 10 miles of the airport from 1635 until the time of the accident. The
thunderstorm, which was over the airport at 1656, intensified rapidly as it approached and
passed over the airport, from the west to east. The path of the center of the cell placed
the shaft of rain and hail along the northern part of the airport where it intersected the
approach path to runway 21R at the threshold-middle marker area. This movement is
consistent with the fact that the transmissometers, which were located generally south of
the storm path, did not indicate decreasing visibility until after 1656. The observations of
the captain of Frontier 214 that the conditions were worse on runway 21R than on runway
21L confirmed the movement of the storm along the northeast part of the airport. The lack of reports by ground observers of heavy rain and hail west of the
airport as well as the NWS radar observations of the cell at 1630, indicated that the
thunderstorm did not develop into a very heavy thunderstorm until it was close to the
airport. Once close to the airport, ground clutter prevented radar observers from
assessing accurately the VIP level of the cell. The Safety Board concludes that the thunderstorm, which was at the airport at
1656, was a VIP level 4 storm which was traveling along the northeast portion of the
airport at 30 knots. The VIP level was confirmed by weather radar observations at 1730.</div>

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] All pilots reported that scattered thunderstorm celis
appeared clearly on airborne weather radar and that the primary cells were west and
southwest of the airport. Pilots with color radar indicated that the cell to the west of the
airport displayed a heavy rainfall rate. The flightcrew of Flight 183 stated that they were
aware of thunderstorms west and southwest of the airport, and their comments on the
CVR indicated that they observed the thunderstorm on radar and visually. They also were
aware that the visibility had dropped from 4 miles to 1 mile and that the winds at the
airports were &quot;shifting rapidly&quot; or were &quot;cyclonic.&quot; Additionally, they heard discussions

on the East Arrival Radar controller frequency about a thunderstorm in progress. In light
of this evidence, the Safety Board concludes that the flighterew of Flight 183 was aware
that a thunderstorm was no more than 5 miles west of the airport, probably closer, as they
reached the outer marker. They also were aware that the thunderstorm was affecting the
wind conditions at the airport and that the surface winds were, at the least, approaching
the ecrosswind landing limits of the DC9. They also expected to encounter a rain shower
as they neared-the airport. Given this information, the flightecrew should have anticipated
that they would encounter thunderstorm-associated conditions if the instrument approach
to runway 21R was continued. The Safety Board concludes that the captain&#x27;s decision to
continue the approach under such conditions was inappropriate. Although by regulation the captain could continue the instrument approach
beyond the outer marker to the point where he started the missed approach, it probably
was contrary to the guidelines in USAir publications and, at the least, unwise. The
flighterew should have known and anticipated that if they did land, the landing would be
made at the same time as, or just before, the time that the thunderstorm arrived at the
airport. Additionally, they were aware that the surface winds might exceed the USAir
DC9 crosswind limits of 25 knots direct crosswind. If the pilots were unsure of the winds,
which they both testified that they were, they should have requested current airport wind
conditions. Finally, they should have been aware that the probability of a gust front
and/or wind shear from the thunderstorm existed and that this would present a hazard to
the airplane during landing. While the captain of Frontier 214 also continued his approach
beyond the outer marker, the similarities and differences in the circumstances are
noteworthy. Frontier 214 was landing on runway 21L which was farther away from the
thunderstorm cell. Frontier 214 started the missed approach more than 1 minute before
Flight 183 and did not fly into the center of the thunderstorm. Based on the factors cited above, the Safety Board concludes that the
captain&#x27;s decision to continue the instrument approach to the point where the missed
approach was started was imprudent, showed poor judgment, and subsequently resulted in
a severe wind shear encounter which led to the accident. The final operational decision of concern was the decision to land
immediately, which the captain made when he saw the runway.</div>

the accident. The Feeder East and Arrival Radar-1 controllers provided flight 191 with

- Several flighterews saw lightning in the rain shower just: north. of. the
. airport; however, they did not report what they saw to. the ATC

controllers. The LCE controller observed lightning about or shortly after the time
flight 191 entered the microburst windfield. Therefore, the failure of
the LCE controller to report it to flight 191 was not a causal factor. .

The flightecrew and the captain had sufficient information to assess the
weather north of the approach end of runway .17L... The lightning
observed and reported by the first officer was adequate, combined with
the other data known to the flightcrew and captain, to determine that
there was a thunderstorm between the airplane-and the airport...

The north side of the cell formation containing the thunderstorm was not
masked from flight 191 by any intervening clouds. The captain&#x27;s decision to continue beneath the thunderstorm did not
comply with Delta&#x27;s weather avoidance procedures; however, the
avoidance procedures did not address specifically thunderstorm
avoidance in the airport terminal area. After penetrating the first part of the microburst, the engine thrust
which had been increased was then reduced and at 550 feet AGL the

airplane -had restabilized momentarily on the glide slope. The captain

evidently believed that they had successfully flown through the worst: of
the mieroburst wind shear, and the approach was continued. me

22. The company had not provided guidance to its flighterews concerning
specific limits on the excursions of airplane performance and control
parameters during low-altitude wind shear encounters that would dictate
the execution of a missed approach.

23. Although the captain did not audibly express his decision to execute a
missed approach until he ealled for the selection of the &quot;TOGA&quot; mode on
the flight director 7 seconds before initial impact, maximum engine
thrust had been applied before the airplane&#x27;s rapid departure below the
glideslope.

24. The accident was not survivable for persons seated forward of row 40
although 8 persons seated forward of the row survived. The accident was
survivable for persons located aft of row 40 and seated in the center and

-right row of seats.

25. Despite notification and coordination difficulties, the emergency
response of the DPS personnel and equipment to the accident scene was
. timely and effective and contributed significantly to saving the lives of 4

- number of the survivors.

3.2 - Probable Cause

The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable causes
of the accident were the flightcrew&#x27;s decision to initiate and continue the approach into a
cumulonimbus cloud which they observed to contain visible lightning; the lack of specific
. guidelines, procedures, and training for avoiding and escaping from low-altitude wind
shear; and the lack of definitive, real-time wind shear hazard information. This resulted
in the aircraft&#x27;s encounter at low altitude with a microburst-induced, severe wind shear
from a rapidly developing ‘thunderstorm located on the final approach course.</div>

maybe a VIP [level] two [echo] ,&quot; but could not state that the smaller echo would mask
the larger cell from a southbound airplane. None of the ground witnesses who had viewed
the north side of the storm described the presence of any clouds or any additional areas of
precipitation in the vicinity of the north side of the storm. The captain of flight 539
following flight 191 testified that he was 5 to 6 miles behind flight 191 when flight 539
turned on final and that he kept flight 191 in sight until it entered the rain shower beneath
the buildup. He also testified that he saw lightning in the area where he lost sight of
flight 191. His first officer stated that when they turned on final, a cell containing
&quot;abundant lightning&quot; was directly off the approach end of runway 17L, and he saw
flight 191 &quot;penetrate the cell.” Based on the evidence the Safety Board concludes that
the cell at the end of runway 17L was not masked from flight 191 by an intervening
weather cell. At 1803:58, flight 191 reported to the tower and stated that they Were &quot;in the
rain,” and at 1805:20, a sound similar to rain was heard on the CVR. Since that sound was
not heard at 1803:58, the Safety Board believes that the rain did not intensify until
1805:20. At 1804:18, the first officer reported seeing lightning &quot;coming out of that one.”
When questioned by the captain he again used the term &quot;that one&quot; to describe the origin of
the lightning and then informed the captain that the lightning was &quot;right ahead of us.&quot;
The Safety Board believes that the language used by the first officer indicated that he
was able to see the cloud or cell that was emitting lightning and that the flightcrew still
had forward visibility until the rain intensified at 1805:20. ;

Wind Field Analysis.--The analyses of the airplane&#x27;s performance and inertial
parameters recorded on the DFDR conducted by both Lockheed and NASA were consistent
and showed that the horizontal winds affecting flight 191 veered from an easterly to a
northerly direction. During the descent, a maximum headwind component of about
26 knots was encountered at 754 feet AGL. The headwind component then decreased,
changed to a tailwind, and the maximum tailwind component of 46 knots occurred near
the first impact point. Since the airplane&#x27;s ground speed was increasing at this time, it
was probably still within the outflow at impact. Based on the rotation of the wind direction along the airplane&#x27;s flight path, the
center of the outflow was located about 1,000 feet west of the airplane&#x27;s ground track and
12,000 feet north of the approach end of runway 17L. Flight 191 encountered the

-horthern edge of the outflow at 1805:14 when its headwind component began increasing
rapidly. At 1805:14, the ATC radar plot showed flight 191 was about 9,900 feet from the
- first touchdown point and about 11,300 feet from State Highway 114.</div>

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] There had been no report of LLWAS-detected wind shears during the flight&#x27;s decent. However, the controllers had begun reporting wind gusts and although the speed of the
gusts was not excessive, the fact that they had just begun marked a change in the
weather. Flight 191 was one of a stream of airplanes landing at the airport, and all of
these airplanes had landed without reporting difficulties or unusual conditions on the
approach. The two airplanes just ahead of flight 191 had landed without reported
difficulty. This fact could have led the captain to believe that, despite its appearance,
the storm did not contain any dangerous weather or that the dangerous portion of the cell
‘was still moving toward the approach course but had not, as yet, reached it. When the lightning was reported and the heavy rain encountered, flight 191
was within 4 nmi of the end of runway 17L. Since there had been no reports that the
weather had reached the airport, and, in fact, it had not, the airport was clear. Given his
airspeed, he was within 2 minutes of landing and he might have decided that his exposure
to the observed weather would be minimal. ;

All of these factors may have led the captain to misappraise the weather and
to ignore one other factor, which he should have known intimately, especially given his
experience and the fact that most of Delta&#x27;s route structure lies in areas where severe
convective storms occur often. Convective-type storm cells are volatile; therefore, a
preceding airplane may encounter little if any weather but the following airplane can
encounter a fully developed storm. The captain should have been well aware of the
volatility of these storms and of the risk of basing a decision on the actions of a preceding
captain. .

The Safety Board believes that the captain had sufficient information to
appraise the weather along the ILS localizer course to runway.17L. The Safety: Board
believes that the captain&#x27;s misappraisal of the severity of the weather could have resulted
from any, or a combination of, the factors cited above. 5

Although the Safety Board believes the accident could have been. avoided had
the procedures contained in the Delta thunderstorm avoidance policy been followed, the
absence of more specific operational guidelines for avoiding thunderstorms in the
terminal areas provided less than optimum guidance to the captain and flighterew. . The

circumstances of this accident indicate that there is an apparent lack of appreciation on
the part of some, and perhaps many, flighterews of the need to avoid thunderstorms and
to appraise the position and severity of the storms pessimistically and cautiously. The
captain of flight 191 apparently was no exception. Consequently, the Safety Board
believes that thunderstorm avoidance procedures should address each phase of an air
carrier&#x27;s operation and, in particular, the carriers should provide specific avoidance
procedures for terminal area operations. While it is the captain&#x27;s responsibility to decide either to continue: or
discontinue a landing approach, the Safety Board believes that in this case, it was a
flighterew decision.</div>

25. Insufficient evidence precluded a positive determination regarding the possible effects of fatigue on the
flightcrew&#x27;s reactions and decisions. The captain&#x27;s decision to penetrate the storm area
was probably based on his interpretation of the
weather radar display. At least 20 min before Flight 242 departed Huntsville,
the NWS had identified by radar the precipitation in

the Rome area as very strong and intense with indications
of hail and cloud tops over 40,000 ft. Southern Airways&#x27; flight dispatch personnel did not
monitor adequately the storm system which moved into
the Rome area, and the information that the dispatch
section provided to Flight 242 did not alert the

flightcrew to the weather hazards along their route. The Atlanta Center controllers had insufficient information about the storm system in the Rome area. Atlanta Center&#x27;s surveillance radars were of limited
value in displaying severe weather systems. The Atlanta Center controllers acquired limited knowledge.
of the storm system in the Rome area from the surveillance
radar. The Atlanta Center controllers provided no information
to Flight 242 about the storm system in the Rome area,
and the flightcrew of Flight 242 did not request any
information from the controllers. The accident was partially survivable. The flight attendants acted commendably for initiating
a comprehensive emergency briefing of the passengers
for their protection in preparation for a crash landing. This contributed to the number of survivors. 3.2 Probable Cause

The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the
probable cause of this accident was the total and unique loss of thrust
from both engines while the aircraft was penetrating an area of severe

thunderstorms. The loss of thrust was caused by the ingestion of massive

amounts of water and hail which in combination with thrust lever movement
induced severe stalling in and major damage to the engine compressors.

-~ 42 -

Major contributing factors included the failure of the company&#x27;s
dispatching system to,provide the flightcrew with up-to-date severe
weather information pertaining to the aircraft&#x27;s intended route of flight,
the captain&#x27;s reliance on airborne weather radar for penetration of thunderstorm areas, and limitations in the Federal Aviation Administration&#x27;s air
traffic control system which precluded the timely dissemination of realtime hazardous weather information to the flightcrew. 4. RECOMMENDATIONS

As a result of this accident, the Safety Board, on September 27
and September 28, 1977, recommended that the FAA:

&quot;Expedite the development and implementation of an aviation
weather subsystem for both en route and terminal area environments, which is capable of providing a real-time display of
either precipitation or turbulence, or both,and which includes
a multiple-intensity classification scheme.</div>

could not be determined why the captain did not take over control at
least in the final stages of the emergency landing. His total flying
experience and DC-9 experience were far superior to that of the first
officer. It can be theorized that his greater familiarity with the DC-9
and its systems made it logical that he devote his attention to attempts
to restart the engines and all related emergency procedures in order to
insure the controllability of the aircraft. The captain may also have
considered the first officer&#x27;s familiarity with Dobbins AFB and its
approaches a reason to let him handle the aircraft.

2.1.2. Acquisition, Dissemination, and Interpretation of Weather

Information

Southern Airways’ Operating Manual contained procedures for
the avoidance of thunderstorms, including the options of delaying flights
on the ground or deviating as necessary while en route to avoid thunderstorms. Consequently, Southern clearly did not intend that its flightcrews
fly through thunderstorms to reach their destinations. It is equally
clear that Flight 242 flew through a severe thunderstorm near Rome,
Georgia. Therefore, the Safety Board sought to determine why the flightcrew
of Flight 242 entered thunderstorms that were extremely hazardous. In Muscle Shoals, the flightcrew had received weather information
through Southern&#x27;s flight dispatch system. However, the most pertinent
information they received was tornado watches Nos. 55 and 56 and SIGMET&#x27;s
Charlie 6 and Bravo 2, all of which were forecasts of conditions that
were expected to materialize in northern Alabama and northern Georgia
sometime between 1120 and 2000 on April 4. During the stop at Huntsville,
both pilots remained in the cockpit. The only additional information
given to them by flight dispatch was the 1500 terminal weather observations
for selected terminals. Consequently, the information was of little
value with regard to the actual flight conditions that might be expected
on the return flight to Atlanta, and the flightcrew, having just 2 hrs
before flown the route on which they were to fly to Atlanta, probably
relied more on their knowledge of actual conditions than on a forecast
or warning of conditions that might materialize. In any event, when Flight 242 departed Huntsville, the flightcrew apparently had little meaningful weather information to alter
their impressions of conditions that existed 2 hrs earlier between
Huntsville and Atlanta. Moreover, despite the requirements of 14 CFR
91.5 15/ and 14 CFR 121.601(b) 16/ there is no evidence that either the
flightcrew or flight dispatch personnel made any significant attempt to
seek information on the current conditions along Flight 242&#x27;s route
between Huntsville and Atlanta, including information from the 1459
weather report from Rome which identified thunderstorms to the northeast _)
and the southwest of Rome. We conclude, therefore, that both flight
dispatch and the flightcrew placed significant reliance on the latter&#x27;s
personal knowledge of conditions along the route. Additionally, we
conclude that both parties relied heavily on the use of the aircraft&#x27;s
weather radar to provide en route weather-avoidance information.

2. ANALYSIS AND CONCLUSIONS 2.1 Analysis

The pilots were certificated properly and were qualified for
the flight. They had received the off-duty time required by regulation. There was no direct evidence, that medical or physiological factors might
have affected the flightcrews performance. The aircraft was certificated, equipped, and maintained in
accordance with regulations and approved procedures. Before encountering
the precipitation and hail which immediately preceded the loss of power
from the engines, there was no evidence of a failure or a malfunction of
the aircraft&#x27;s structure, powerplants, or flight controls. Moreover,
except for the possibility that the aircraft&#x27;s weather radar system may
not have been functioning effectively, there was no evidence that any
of the aircraft&#x27;s other systems had failed or malfunctioned. From an evaluation of all the evidence, the Safety Board
concludes that the causal factors related to this accident are associated
with the severe weather conditions that Flight 242 encountered near
Rome, Georgia, the extent of the flightcrew&#x27;s knowledge of those conditions

‘before the encounter, and the information about those conditions provided
to the flightcrew. After the severe weather conditions were encountered
and thrust from the engines was completely ‘and permanently lost, an
accident most probably was inevitable.

2.1.1 Engine Failures and Flightcrew Reactions

The engine tests, the review of. JT8D compressor research data,
and passenger and flight attendant testimony produced a viable theory of
how N1335U&#x27;s engines were damaged so severely. Clearly, based on passenger and flight attendant testimony,
radar weather reports, and the CVR, the aircraft flew in rain most of
the time after it departed Huntsville and flew in heavy rain and. hail
for about 2 1/2 min immediately before thrust was lost completely from
the engines. Although the intensity of the rain and hail is not known,
the Safety Board concludes that the intensity was sufficient to cause
the rotational speed of the engines to decrease below that required for
operation of the engine~driven generators. This is supported by the 36sec loss of normal electrical power which began at 1607:57 while the
aircraft was in heavy rain and hail. Furthermore, the Safety Board
concludes that engine rotational speed was lost shortly after the thrust
levers were retarded to low settings~-probably flight idle--in preparation
for the descent from 17,000 to 14,000 ft. Passenger testimony supports
this conclusion. Also, the engine tests proved that rotational speed
will be lost at low thrust settings if water is ingested at a rate
greater than 14 percent water-to-air ratio. The engines did not lose combustion during the first loss of
rotational speed because they surged and stalled, which could only have
occurred if the compressors were being driven. Also, engine tests’
showed that, despite the loss of rotational speed caused by water ingestion,
combustion was not lost. Therefore, the Safety Board concludes that
neither the presence of, nor the absence of, engine ignition during the
first loss of rotational speed was a factor in the ultimate loss of
thrust.</div>

reported the maximum tops to be from 40,000 to 45,060 feet; these were issued after the
flight departed Trinidad. The 1930 NWS radar overlay showed the maxinium precipitation
top at 49,000 feet. This cell was located about 68 miles north-northeast of Flight 968

when the severe jolt waz encountered. The captain&#x27;s second radar return, about 20 miles
to the right of his Course, was not verified by ground rader, but it should not have been a
factor in the encounter because of the direction of the prevailing winds. The Board consulted with NASA about this accident and learned that it was
their view that Flight 995 encountered the same type of clear air turbulence that existed
in the 1981 Hannibal, Missouri, encounter. (See footnote 7.) A review of FAA Advisory
Circular 60-6, &quot;Aviation Weather,” dated 1965, states that, &quot;.. .thunderstorms commonly
benetrate the upper troposphere and sometimes the stratosphere. They should be given a
wide Lerth horizontally and vertically because they are eapable of producing extreme
turbulence. ...&quot;&quot; It further Status, &quot;Turbulence, in particular, may be encountered in clear
air for a considerable distance horizontally and vertically from growing thunderstorms.&quot;
U.S. Air Foree Manual 51-12, &quot;Weather For Airerews,&quot; dated August 1, 1974, alerts
military pilots of this phenomenon by stating that, &quot;Severe tubulence can be encountered
in the anvil 15 to 30 miles downwind. ..The most severe turbulence outs the storm
occurs in the clear air downwind.&quot; The Safety Board believes that the evidence shows
that Flight 965 encountered turbuienee developed as a result of the level 4 thunderstorm
activity 24 miles south-southwest of the flight which had protruded into the high,
southwesterly winds aleft. This formation would have produced the wave of clear air
turbulence which disturbed the airplane. There was no specific forecast of Clear air turbulence for the area in which
Flight 965 was transiting. Based upon the information in the World Meteoroloical
Organizations Technical Note No. 155, 11/ clear cir turbulence would not have been
anticipated. The two convective SIGMETS which were issued implied moderate to severe
turbuience associated with thunderstorms. Consequently, In view of the current oriteria
used by NWS, the Safety Board considers the forecasts issued to have been substantially
correet with regard to thunderstorm activity and they implied the potential for severe
turbulence. Neverthsless, since the airplane eneountered a form of clear air
turbulence, i2/ the Safety Board believes that, in view of sacent research and
investigation experience, the criterin used by NWS is not entirely edequate. The Board
believes that in cases such as this, the forecasts eculd be improved by considering the
interaction between jet stream velocity winds and thunderstorms which have the potential
to produce clear air turbulence downstream of cumulonimbus clouds.

(CP) feature of his radarscope and, therefore, had not been viewing the more detailed
picture of the weather pattern. He probably was using the CP feature because he was
more concerned about separating aircraft, his primary responsibility. However, after
becoming aware of the PIREP on turbulence, the controller assisted ‘he other flights by
providing advisories and modified routings. Although it appeared that he had an
opportunity to recommend that Flight 965 turn farther east to avoid flying close to the
thunderstorms, he became preoccupied at that time in providing required separation
between Flight 965 and People Express 545 as they converged in the area of OLVEY at
the same flight level. As e result, he turned Flight 965 north only to provide sufficient
separation between the two aircraft before Flight 965 arrived at OLDEY. The FAA implernented the HIWAS program to alleviate the burden on the
controller of providing weather advisories. In the Safety Board&#x27;s opinion, the basic
concept has merit. Its use could be to the en route controller what automatic terminal
information service (ATIS) has become to the terminal airspace controller. However, the
Board is co.:2erned that numerous active pilots interviewed during t&#x27;s investigation said
that they were not aware of the HIWAS program. it is evident that an educational anc
communication problem exists which must be corrected.

                        <div class="chunk-text">[ANALYSIS] Since It was nighttime, the crew had
determined that they were in upper cloud based on the reflection of strobe lights, and had
also observed some static discharges on the windscreen. Although several flights in the
next several minutes either changed course or requested mere information, Flight 965 did
not, and it continued on the northerly heading. At 1925:59, 2 minutes 35 seconds later,
Fiight 965 reported that it had encountered the severe jolt, just north of the PANAL
intersection (the encounter actually took place south of the PANAL intersection.)

Reconstruction of Flight 965&#x27;s flightpath using the 1930 overlay from the Nws
radar at Wilmington showed that Flight 985 had been about 12 miles east-southeast of a
line of thunderstorms with very heavy, level 4. rainshowers, and 2¢ miles north-northeast
of another area of heavy, level 4, rainshowers. ‘The radar showed that precipitation tops
were mostly below 35,000 feet. Also, the radar data confirmed that Flight 985 was in an
area of lighter rainshowers at the time of the encounter. After making the northbound turn at OLDEY, the captain had observed fading,
light weather returns on his radar, 40 to 50 miles ahead with 2° of downward tilt of the
antenna. This observation indicated that the flight was overflying shower activity at
heights of about 22,000 to 27,000 feet. The NWS radar overlay, however, showed that the
flight was not directly over any significant shower activity during its flight, but that it
had proceeded northbound to within about 12 miles of an area of intense shower activity
before the severe turbulence was encountered. Company procedures request that
flighterews remain 20-miles away from thunderstorms above 20,000 feet. The Board
concludes that the thunderstorm activity directly ahead of Flight 985 should have been
visible on the captain&#x27;s radarscope, but that the tops of the precipitation probably would
have been shown as below 35,000 feet in this area. Therefore, the selected altitude of FL
370 would have allowed the airplane to overfly the thunderstorm activity. ‘The
flightcrew&#x27;s report of flying in upper clouds along with the presence of static discharges
indicates the flight encountered cirrus or ice crystal clouds. These tvpes of clouds could
have been the &quot;anvil&quot; of cumulonimbus clouds which oceurs downwind of cumulonimbus
activity. The captain would not have been abie to detect this anvit cloud with his radar. The 4930 GOES satellite photograph confirmed the existence of this type of weather
condition. Furthermore, the captain was not aware of the convective SIGMET&#x27;s which had
reported the maximum tops to be from 40,000 to 45,060 feet; these were issued after the
flight departed Trinidad. The 1930 NWS radar overlay showed the maxinium precipitation
top at 49,000 feet. This cell was located about 68 miles north-northeast of Flight 968

1, There was no evidence of any failure or malfunction of
aircraft structure, flight instruments, flight controls,
or powerplants. Flight 121 was conducting an ILS approach to runway 27R. While the approach was in progress a mature thunderstorm
with heavy rainshowers and gusty winds was moving from
southwest to northeast across the airport. The core of
the storm was over the center of the airport between
1707 and 1710. The storm contained severe horizontal and vertical wind
shears astride the final approach and wissed approach
course. ‘fhe exact magnitude of the horizontal and
vertical winds could not be determined. The tower controllers should hav: delivered the below
minimum RVR data when they acknowacu,c Plight 12)&#x27;s
transmission that it was inside the OM or shortly
thereafter. The flightcrew had the storm under observation either on
their radar or through the cockpit windshield from the
time they entered the Philadelphia area. The storm cell
was of sufficient intensity to contour on their radar. There was sufficient weather data available for the crew
to decide to abandon the approach at, or shortly after,
passing the OM. The aircraft was capable of traversing the wind shear
speeds in simulated wind models 3, 4a, and 5a at 1.86
EPR only if flown with precise adherence to the pitch
angle dictated by the command bars even though indicated
airspeeds dropp:d betow V2.

The captain did not maintain the pitch attitude commanded
by the command bars throughout the approach. The nose
was lowered, probably to a pitch attitude of about 2°, in
an effort to regain V2 speed. The aircraft was probably
rotated to the pitch attitude dictated by the command
bars just before the crash. Although the crew did not follow prescribed company
orocedures for setting their thrust for the go-around,
rhe captain otherwise attempted to conduct the go-around
ir accordance with the procedures contained in his
company’s manuals.

3.2 Probabie Cause

The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the
probable cause of this accident was the aircraft&#x27;s encounter with severe
horizontal and vertical wind shears near the ground as a result of the
captain&#x27;s continued approach into a clearly marginal severe weather
condition. The wircraft&#x27;s ability to cope under th-=se conditions was
borderline when flown according to standard operating procedures;
however, if the aircraft&#x27;s full aerodynamic and power capability had
been used, the wind shear could probably have been flown through
successfully. Contributing to the accident was the tower controller&#x27;s
failure to provide timely below-ainimum RVR informatic..

4, SAFETY RECOMMENDATIONS

The National Transportation Safety Board has issued recommendations to the Federal Aviation Administration and to the National Weather
Service urging that they initiate a method for displaying precipitation
on approach control radarscopes and for classifying these returns so that
the controller could relay the classification to the pilot. The controliler
would, thereby, be relieved of interpreting the returns. These recommendations were made as a result of the investigations of the crash of Flight 1%1
and a Southern Airways DC-9 at New Hope, Georgia, on April 4, 1977.</div>

The crewnembers were trained, certificated, and qualified ror
the flight according t:o FAA regulations. Both pilots had adequate rest
periods before reporting for duty. There was no indication of any
medical or physiological problems that would have affected the performance

The aircraft was certificated, maintained, and equipped according
to FAA regulations. There was no evidence cf in-flight fire, structural
failure, flight control maifunctions, or powerplant malfunctions. The ILS approach to runway 27R at Philadelphia fnternativnal
Airport confor:ed to the published approach procedure and the carrier&#x27;s
operations procedures and was performed routinely until the go-around
was begun. While the approach was in progress, a mature thunderstorm with
heavy rainshowers and strong gusty winds was moving from southwest to
northeast across the airport at a speed of about 15 kns, The ceilfng in
the storm was between 200 and 400 ft obscured, and the surface visibility
was about 1/4 mi. About the time of the accident the surface wind was
14 kns and gusting to 36 kns. The RVP. for runway 27R was about 1,600 ft,
and the surface wind was from the southwest. The storm whi_h developed to its peak intensity rapidly was
not considered by radar specialists to be of reportable intensity until
1717--after Flight 121 had crashed. The approach control radar did not
depict the area of precipitation because of the nearness of the storm to
the radar antenna and because its radar equipment is designed to suppress
precipitation returns in order to improve its traffic display. The
approach controller could not see outside because his duty station nad
no windows. Consequently, his knowledge of the immediate weather
situation was obtained from communtcation with flightcrews and control
tower personnel. Though the rair was reported as moderate between 1704 and
1719, the rainfall graph disclosed that heavy rain was in progress. Neither the tower nor the National Weather Service weather observer
reported less than 1 mi visibility. The weather reports, performance
studies, and the results of simulations indicate that a severe horizontal and vertital wind shear existed along the final approach and
missed approach paths. The exact magnitude of the horizontal] and vertical
components of the winds in the shear could not be determined.</div>

the flight dispatch center should have tried to determine more precisely the location and severity of the thunderstorm activity. Such
an endeavor, however, was not made until shortly before the thunderstorms
moved across the airport. By then, insufficient time remained for the
dispatcher to warn Flight 809. The Ozark flight dispatch center did not have the equipment to receive
either the narrative weather radar summaries or the FM broadcast of the
severe thunderstorm warning. The Board believes that the information
contained in these summartes should have received wider dissemination,
because it was the best analysis of the local weather situation.

As a vesult of this and several other accidents which have
occurred during thunderstorms in terminal areas, the question arises
whether FAA controllers :nould be authorized to refise pilots&#x27; requests for an approach, landing, or takeoff, when the weather conditions
at the airport are too severe, in the controller&#x27;s opinion, for safe
terminal area operations. (See Appendix F.}}

- fl Under existing procedures, controllers may provide only official
§ weather data, general observations without specific values, and infor-
. @ mation derived from instruments, radar, o* pilot reports, which is
; generally adequate under most circumstanc. , However, when the controller
j is able to observe severe weather activity affecting the airport or the
§ approach or departure patns, the Board believes that he should have
a authority to refuse approach, landing, and takeoff requests except
lg upon the declaration of an emergency by the pilot.

survivability -- The accident was nonsurvivable with respect
to the passengers because the decelerative forces approached the limits
of human tolerance, the restraint mechanisms failed, and the occupiabl+

that the decelerative forces had been near the limits of human tolerance, =
All but one of tie ‘ssenger seats failed during the crash sequence, ——
The passenger cabi. was torn open by impact with trees, and the unrestrained -
occupants were ejected with sufficient force to produce fatal injuries
upon collision with unyielding objects. Four passengers survived because
they were thrown clear, without colliding with any objects that could
inflict more serious indurtés. Both pilots survived because the cockpit remained relatively intact =

ficantly, both pilots probably would have received only minor injuries, 4
had their upper torsos been restrained by shoulder harnesses. The cabin attendant received fatal injuries when she was struck by

to adhere to published flight schedules, (2) company training regarding
recognition and avoidance of thunderstorms and associated severe weather
phenomena, (3) available weather information, and (4) assessment
by the captain of the available weather information. The Board did not find any conclusive evidence of undue company
pressure on pilots to adhere to published flight schedules, Additionally,
the captain denied that such pressure would have affected his decision
to continue the approach,

The Board&#x27;s review of Ozark Air Line&#x27;s training program and company
policies concerning thunderstorm avoidance and the operations manta
indicated that the material on thunderstorm avoidance was comprehensive
with one exception -~ encounters with thunderstorms in the terminal area. The manual stipulated that thunderstorms were to be avoided by 10
to 20 miles depending on their severity. No exceptions were listed. The
captain did not maintain 10- to 20-mile separation from observed thunder-

storms after coming under control of the approach controller. However,
Ozark management personnel and pilots applied these provisions to en route
operations. In terminal area operations the pilot should have evaluated
the weather in the terminal area, made a decision regarding his intentions,
and kept ATC advised of his intentions so that the controller could take
appropriate action, In this instance, the pilot did evaluate the weather
and decided ta continue to accept the approach clearances issued by the
controller. The Board believes that more definitive criteria should be included in the operations manual for operations in the terminal area when
thunderstorms exist in that area. In addition, more information regarding
the low-altitude fazards associated with thunderstorms should be provided
to the flightcrews. The captain of Flight 809 and other Ozark pilots who testified at
the public hearing did not appear to be familiar with pertinent portions
of the operations manual, The Board belfeves that additional company
emphasis i$ required to assure that all pilots are thoroughly familfar
with the company operating policies and procedures,

There was an adequate amount of weather information available to the
captain visually and through use of the aircraft&#x27;s weather radar. The
fact that the captain could see the runwey lights through the rain may
have misled tim in evaluating the intensity of the thunderstorm. However,
other cues regarding the intensity of the storm should have bean as
visible to him as they were to other pilots on the approach,

These cues, with his extansive pilot experience, should have been
sufficient to alert him to the possibility of turbulence and downdrafts in the vicinity of the heavy rain and the rol] cloud,

An experienced pilot should have been aware of the updraft and
downdraft hazards associated with roll clouds that precede thunderstorm
activity. These clouds ave a direct indication of the extreme severity
of the associated thunderstorm activity, and they should be avoided
by a substantial distance,

Additionally, the surface wind information and the heavy rain
observation provided by the local controller should have alerted the
captain that he was continuing his approach into difficult conditions.</div>

~ 23 - 2.2 Conclusions (a) Findings
1. The accident was nonsurvivabtle.

2. The cabin attendant&#x27;s seat was not properly certificated,
because it did not meet FAA reaulations.

3, The captain&#x27;s and first officer&#x27;s injuries would have been
much less severe, had these crewmembers been restrained by
shoulder harnesses.

4, {{he thunderstorm that moved across the airport and the
Tocalizer course shortly after 1740 was severe; the
storm was more severe in a small area along the localizer
course where the accident occurred.

5. The severity of the storm was not reflected fn the
official NWS weather data available to the flightcrew,
company dispatchers, or air traffic controllers.

6. The NWS aviation terminal forecast valid at the time of the
accident for St. Louls did not predict accurately the weather
conditions that could have been expected to affect the area,
and an amended forecast was not issued,

7, The NWS narrative radar summaries accurately reflected the
weather conditions moving into the St. Louts area.

8. The narrative weather radar summaries were not available to
either the FAA air traffic control facilities, the Ozark
Air Lines Flight Dispatch Center, or the flightcrew.

9. Ozark Air Lines did not provide its flightcrews with specific
thunderstorm avoidance criteria for terminal area operations.

10, The airborne weather radar on N4215 functfoned properly,
and the flightcrew used the radar to locate the thunderstorms
in the St. Louis area,

11. Between the OM and the accident site, the aircraft was struck
by one or more bolts of lightning.

12, There was no evidence that lightning adversely affected ar!
of the vital systems or components of the aircraft,

13. The aircraft descended below the glide slope after passing

the OM: this descent wes probably cuused by a severe downraft,

Dag Meee bee

14. The captain decided to cuntinue his approach
into weather conditions assoctated with a —
thunderstorm; the severity of these conditions
should have been apparent to him. (b) Probable Cause

The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable
cause of the accident was the aircraft&#x27;s encounter with a downdraft
following the captain&#x27;s decision to initiate and continue an instrument
approach into a thunderstorm.</div>

The Pan Am FOM notes that wind shears and gust fronts can be associated
with thunderstorrns and that they ure generally located within 5 to 10 miles of a thunderstorm, The FOM states that when &quot;significant&quot; thunderstorm activity is within 15 miles
of the airport, the captain should take appropriate measures to avoid the storm. However, the determination of the severity of the thunderstorm and the measures to be
used to avoid the thunderstorm and its associated hazards {{s vested in the captain, and
that decisicn would be bused on his training, experience, and judgment. It was not possible to precisely determine how often the captain and first
officer had encountered weather conditions similar to those which existed at takeoff on
July 9, 1982. However, the captain and first officer were Miami-based and had flown

National Airline&#x27;s and Pan Am&#x27;s southern routes since 1965 and 1976, respectively. From
NOAA climatological datu, thunderstorm occurrences during the 3 summer months in
various cities served by the two airlines ip Alabama, Florida, and Louisiana average about
45 days. Considering this, the Safety Board believes that the pilots were familiar with
and had experience in dealing with the convective type weather occurring on July 9, 1982,
and had successfully flown in such weather and evaluated !ts severity using their airplane
weather radar systems. The effect of rainfall on the capability of the X-band weather radar systems Is
well known and has been presented to flightcrews during their initial training in the ue of
the system, in operational bulletins, and in cautionary notes in the Pan Ain FOM. Given
the importance of the airplane&#x27;s weather radar system in avoiding (hunderstorms, the first
officer&#x27;s end captain&#x27;s experience in flying in areas in which convective weather activity
is predominant during the summer months, the Sefety Bourd concludes that both pilots
were competent in the use of their radar system, were familiar with its limitations, and
would have considered the effects of these limitations in thelr evaluation of any
convective returns they observed on their radarscope. The Safety Bourd has concluded
that, due to the limitations of the X-band weather radar system, it was possible that the
radar echoes east of the field woud not have contoured on Clipper 759&#x27;s radar. What the
evidence does not show wus the precise location of these echoes as portrayed on Clipper
759&#x27;s radarscope.

concerning thunderstorm and wind shear avoidance provided in the Pan Am manuals, the
weather information provided by the company, the ATC advisories issued before takeoff,
and the use of the airplane&#x27;s weather radar system. Company Manuals.—The description of thunderstorms, wind shear, and the
meteorological phenomena associated with them are adequately explained in the Pan Am
company manuals. Although new data are now emerging from the JAWS project
concerning microbursts and downbursts, the data provided in the Pan Arn FOM and AOM
represented an accurate portrayal of the low level wind shear as known on the date of the
accident. The manuals emphasize that low level wind shears are associated with
thunderstorms and that they can be in front of, to one side of, and behind the storm cell

Tre Pan Am FOM states that in the event of &quot;significant thunderstorm
activity.... within 15 miles of the airport, the captain should consider conducting the
departure or arrival from a differer:! direction or delaying the takeoff or landing. Use all
available information for this judgment including pireps, ground radar, aircraft radar,
tower reported winds, and visual observations.&quot; Because of Clipper 759&#x27;s takeoff gross
weight, Clipper 759 was required to take off from runway 10; the captain did not have
available the option of changing the direction of takeoff. The Pan Am FQOM contained a short description of the LLWSAS, its
limitations, and the type information the flightcrew could expect to receive from the
controllers at airports with a LLWSAS. The FOM states that LLWSAS wind information
&quot;is strictly informational, and no action is required unless deemed appropriate by the
pot.&quot;

The intent of the company manuals is straightforward. They describe the
thunderstor:n and wind shear phc..omena, the possible consequences, and the necessity for
avoiding them. They establish a distance standard ~~ 15 nmi -- at which the captain must
exercise options to avoid the cen -equences of an encounter with the hazards associated
with &quot;significant thunderstorms activity.&quot; Thereafter, it is the captain&#x27;s responsibility to
evaluate and decide the severity of the weather with which he must contend, and hased on
this decision, to choose an appropriate course of action. The company manuals describe
the available sources of the information on which this decision is to be based. The
information and guidelines in the Pan Am manuals concerning this decision process are
essentially the same as those contatned in similar manuals of other air carriers. Thus, it
is appropriate to examine the information provided to the captain of Clipper 759 and to
ascertain its adequacy relevant to his decision to ta :e off. The flight folder provided to the captain of Clipper 759 at Miami contained
the 0740, July 9, 1982, area forecast. This forecast was still valid at the time Clipper 759

The weight of the evidence showed that the winds which affected Clipper 759
were produced by a microburst whicn had occurred on the airport. The preliminary
analysis of the JAWS data show that the microburst and downburst occurrences caunoat be
related to storm intensity. Therefore, neither the precise moment one will occur nor the
numerical probability of such an occurrence can be forecast. The wind shear which
affected Clipper 759 was not detected until after it began its takeoff. If meteorologists
and current technology cannot predict the location, the frequency of occurrence, and
severity of this type of wind shear, pilots cannot be expected to ordinarily or routinely
predict where or when one will occur or to estimate its severity. Operational Decisions.—In trying to assess whether the captein&#x27;s decision to
take off was reasonable, the Safety Board considered the guidelines contained in the Pan
Am AQM and FOM concerning wind shear and thunderstorm avoidance, the weather
information available to the flightcrew, the airplane&#x27;s weather radar system, and the
training and experience of the captain and the first officer.

‘The Safety Board believes that the wind shear information available to the
industry does not provide sufficient guidance concerning wind shear avoidance. In
particular, the data do not contain quantitative wind speed values which could te applied
by pilots as a standard for refusing or delaying either a takeoff or an approach and
landing. Consequently, the guidance contained in the Pan Am FOM, although generally
considered the &quot;state-of-the-art&quot; information, did not contain any quantitative wind speed
values which would indicate that the wind shear was of a magnitude that could approach
or might exceed the capability of the airplane or pilot to fly through the phenomenon
safely. Thus, the guidance in this area, unlike that concerning recommended minimum
separation distances from thunderstorms, contain no quantitative wind speed paramaters
and no recommended courses of action for the pilot to follow should these parameters be
approached or exceeded. Should quantitative wind speed parameters be established, the
resultant parameters should be used to establish specific guidance or recommended
courses of action for pilots to follow should the prescribed values contained therein be
approached or exceeded. The Safety Board believes that the LLWSAS could be used more efficiently and
that more emphasis should be placed on its use in air carrier training programs.</div>

capable of adjusting the flow of traffic into terminal areas so that timely
actions and rational judgments in the interest of air safety are primary
to moving the traffic. Pilots must exercise more independent judgments when they are
confronted with severe weather conditions in the terminal areas. They
must recognize that the conditions within, under, or near rapidly developing and maturing thunderstorms are dynamic and can change
significantly within a short distance or within a short time, or both. In particular, they must recognize and avoid low-altitude hazards
associated with thunderstorms along or near the approach path. Air carrier and NWS forecasters must emphasize the accurate
and timely forecasting and reporting of severe weather conditions. The
NWS must emphasize the determination of thunderstorm severity and
must accurately project thunderstorm development and movement, ~
particularly in or near high density terminal areas. The NWS must
provide this information and other weather radar information to the
air traffic control system in a timely manner. As a corollary, the
improved location of weather radar equipment is needed, particularly
in high density terminal areas. The Safety Board stresses the continuing need for air carrier
operations managers and dispatchers, in conjunction with captains of
flights destined for high density terminal areas, to plan their operations
to take into account the extensive delays that might become necessary
when severe weather conditions exist or are forecasted in the areas. These delays must be predicted conservatively and procedures developed
to cope with them, particularly if it is likely that the captain might have
to choose a nonroutine course of action to avoid penetration of thunderstorms. Finally, reliable wind shear detection equipment is needed at
commercial airports. However, several years of research may be
needed before a reliable system can be developed and made operational. In the meantime, flightcrews must be trained to recognize meteorological
conditions conducive to wind shear and flight techniques to overcome
wind shear should be emphasized. Similarly, ATC supervisors and
controllers must learn that low-altitude wind shear is a serious hazard
to all aircraft particularly to large jet transports, and that air traffic
operations should be conducted to avoid the phenomenon whenever
possible. During the past 7 years, the Safety Board has made a number of
recommendations in the preceding areas. (/ Although the development
of wind shear detection equipment has been emphasized, limited operational progress has been made. Additionally, little progress has been
made in the areas of: (1) The dissemination of radar-detected severe
weather information to the air traffic control system, (2) the formal
training of flightcrews in the recognition of wind shear and the techniques
for coping with wind shear, and (3) timely and accurate forecasts of wind
shear.

Air flow is disturbed significantly within a mature thunderstorm cell and in the air mass surrounding the cell. These disturbances
are dominated generally by vertical drafts, both up and down, which are
created when the relatively cold and more dense air formed at higher _
altitudes displaces the warmer and less dense air near the surface. The
downdrafts, which are frequently accompanied by heavy rain, can reach
vertical speeds exceeding 30 fps. The interaction between the descending
air and the earth&#x27;s surface causes the flow to change from the vertical
w+. crcauus to the horizontal direction and creates a horizontal outflow of

air in all directions beneath the cell and near the surface. The speeds
of the vertical drafts and horizontal outflows depend on the severity of
the storm. An aircraft passing through, below, or near a thunderstoi...
cell at low altitude may encounter these rapidly changing vertical and
horizontal winds. 5

To analyze the effects of these rapidly changing winds on the
flightpath of an airplane,’ forces which act on the airplane must be
considered. These forces are lift, drag, weight, and thrust. Ina
dynamic situation, changes in the lift and drag are most significant
because they depend at any instant on the airplane&#x27;s relative wind
vector; that is, the direction and speed of the impinging air stream
relative to the airplane&#x27;s control axes. The airplane&#x27;s weight can be
considered a constant since it varies only as fuel is consumed. Thrust
is related primarily to throttle position and only to a small extent to
the properties of the engine inlet air. The analysis is simplfied by resolving the components of
these forces along the aircraft&#x27;s vertical and longitudinal axes. As
long as the components of the forces are balanced, the airplane will
remain in unaccelerated flight. However, if the forces are unbalanced,
by the pilot&#x27;s manipulation of the throttles or flight controls or by a
change in the environment surrounding the airplane, the airplane will
accelerate or decelerate until a new flightpath is established and the
forces are again balanced. When the airplane flies into a vertical wind, the transient
change in the direction of the total wind vector, relative to the airplane&#x27;s entry path, causes a change in both lift and drag. If the
vertical wind&#x27;s direction is downward, the lift and drag will decrease
and the airplane will accelerate downward. The basic stability of the
airplane will cause it to pitch nose up initially; however, the ultimate
effect on the airplane&#x27;s flightpath will be an increase in the descent
rate relative to the ground. If the flight controls remain fixed, the
aircraft will restabilize and descend with the descending air mass. Thus, the change in the airplane&#x27;s rate of descent relative to the
ground will equal the vertical speed of the wind and, if longitudinal-

wind does not change, the airspeed will remain approximately constant. The pilot can compensate for this condition by increasing the airplane&#x27;s
pitch attitude and by adding thrust to establish a climb relative to the
descending air mass. He will thereby maintain the desired flightpath.</div>

The severity of the effects produced by an encounter with a
decreasing headwind will depend on the magnitude of the change in wind
speed and the abruptness with which the change occurs. Obviously, the
higher the speed change and the shorter the time interval involved, the
greater the effect on the airplane&#x27;s flightpath. ’

. Other significant factors include the airplane&#x27;s entry airspeed,
its configuration, and its flight characteristics under such conditions. For example, a jet transport which encounters the wind change at an indicated airspeed of 155 kn will experience less loss of lift and will develop
a lower initial descent rate than the same airplane which encounters the
condition at 140 kn. Also, a smaller aircraft, with a lower wing loading,
and operating with a higher relative airspeed margin between approach
and stall speeds, will likely be less affected than the large transport. Therefore, the pilot of a jet transport who flies at a higher-than-normal
approach speed and the pilot of a small airplane who flies at a normal
approach speed may be able to stop the rate of descent imposed on their
aircraft quicker, with lower control forces, and with less thrust addition
than the pilot of a jet transport who flies at normal approach speed. As illustrated above, passage through either a downdraft or
a decreasing headwind can singularly be hazardous; however, when combined, the two conditions produce an even more critical situation. A
mature thunderstorm cell contains both. As the airplane approaches
the storm, it encounters the influence of the horizontal outflow in the
opposite direction of flight as an increasing headwind; as the flight
continues, it passes below the storm and through the peak downdraft. Almost immediately, the change in direction of the horizontal outflow
will affect the aircraft as an abrupt decrease or loss of headwind. The
sequence of the wind change can be particularly dangerous since the
pilot might reduce power when he senses the positive performance
effect caused by the initially increasing headwind. Therefore, the airplane may already be power deficient when it encounters the downdraft
and loss of headwind; thus, their negative effect on the airplane&#x27;s
performance is compounded. The Safety Board concludes from the evidence that Eastern
66 and at least four of the flights which preceded it encountered abrupt
changes in the vertical and horizontal winds on the approach path to
runway 22L. When Eastern 66 was tracking the glideslope near the OM, the
airplane was affected by a slight headwind and little or no vertical winds. While the airplane descended and approached the strongest cells of the
thunderstorm, it was influenced by the vertical winds and the horizontal
outflow. The increase in headwind of about 15 kn and possibly an updraft produced a reduction in the rate of descent and the airplane moved
slightly above the glidepath as it descended between 600 feet and 500 feet.</div>

the available evidence which indicates that no fire occurred before the

ne A third possible effect of lightning was also considered. This was
a the possibility that a lightning strike, or nearby flash of lightning,
na caused the pilot to lose control of the aircraft either by temporarily

Tne initial failure of the structure was a chordwise compression

a result of overstress of the material and, if any prior damage did

for the captain of Flight 352 to reconsider his decision to penetrate

After the penetration of the storm had been initiated, the
decision to reverse course was not in keeping with recomnended
company procedures for speration in areas of turbulence. Normally,
once in an area of turbulence, the crew is expected to maintain the
attitude of the aircraft as nearly straight and level as possible
and maneuvering is to be kept to a minimm until the turbulent area
is cleared. The possibility of gusts being added to control inputs,
and resulting in an upset, is a consideration that must be assumed by
the pliot. Because of certain apparent anomalies in the flight data recorder
readout, the Board analyzed the recorder readout in an attempt to
clarify the recorded data, These anomalies were apparent time reversals in the indicated heading and airspeed traces near the end of
the recording, They occurred during the short period of time following
the epparent upset and attempted recovery. During this period, the
aircraft was being subjected to violent and rapidly fluctuating accelerations. In addition, the heading and airspeed were changing very
rapidly due to aircraft maneuvering, and the heading trace was also
being affected by gimbal errors. Under these conditions, the advance
rate of the record mediwn can be very erratic and can even reverse in
direction momentarily. In addition, extremely rapid movement of the
styli can cause slight wrinkling of the aluminum foil. The aberrations,
in our opinion, invalidste the indicated advance or reversal of time
for this very brief period and also serve to confirm that the aircraft
was being subjected to extremely violent and rapidly fluctuating accelerations. There is nothing in this situation, however, to cause us
to doubt the validity of the magnitude of the recorded data points. The Board then analyzed the readout in an atteapt to define the
terminal maneuvers of the accident aircraft. This analysis indicated
that the aircraft commenced a 24° bank at 1647:10 and maintained this
bank for 10 seconds. During this 10-second period, a load factor of
1.1 &quot;g&quot; would have been required to maintained the 24° bank angle in
level flight. The centroid of the &quot;g&quot; trace peaks on the readout were
considered to be the average acceleration for the time period under
consideration and were determined to be 1.3 for the first 5 seconds
and 1.1 for the second 5 seconds.</div>

outboard fracture indicates that both an upward aileron deflection and
the previously mentioned hydraulicking of the fuel in the No. 4 tank
were present at the time of the breakup, Both of these conditions can
be explained if the inboard failure occurred first. The pull on the
aileron push-pull rod as the wing separated would result in an upward
overtravel of the right aileron. Furthermore, 4 relatively high internal
pressure would have been produced at the outboard end of the No. k fuel

tank by the inertial loads forcing fuel outboard during a rolling
pullout and by the rapid rotation of the wing during the breakup. Conversely, if the initial failure was outboard of the engines, then
there is no rational explanation for the manner of failure in that
area, and it is unlikely that the remainder of the wing could have
failed as it did. The crew of the accident aircraft had flowm from Dallas to
Houston severai hours prior to their departure from Houston returning
to Dallas. At that time, there was no thunderstorm activity in the
area which would have affected their return trip, and this observation
nay have influenced their interpretation of the weather warnings ard
SIGMEE&#x27;s provided to them on their departure from Houston. The coupany
anda Weather Bureau data available to the crew contained adequate information regarding the condition and extent of the severe weather, with
minor inaccuracies as to location and time. Regardless of the accuracy
of the weather forecasts, the crew observed the storm from a point at
least 60 miles away, from an altitude of 20,000 feet. They were also
advised, after requesting a deviation to the west, that other aircraft,
including company traffic, were deviating to the east. The airvorne
weather radar on board the aircraft should have delineated the easvern
edge of the storm area as well us any low spots betveen cell tops. The
evidence indicates that while the storm system was extensive to the west,
there would be low spots tetween the tops of the celis. These low spots
could have been misinterpreted by the crew as a &quot;light area&quot; or separation between cells, particularly if the radar antenna was tilted up
8°, as the recovered radar antenna cockpit control found in the wreckage
indicates. If this condition existed, the presentation on tne aircraft
yradarscope would continue to be misleading as the aircraft approached
the storm, In this connection, we note that at 1646:09, in response to
